1	THE 19-YEAR-OLD DRIVER OF THE AMERICAN RACING CUSTOM WHEELS SPIKE-ESSLINGER TRAILS FOURTH PLACE TANNER THORSON BY 29 POINTS, 535-506. JERRY COONS JR. IS FIFTH WITH 526 AND SPENCER BAYSON IS SIXTH WITH 519. THREE EVENTS IN THE SERIES REMAIN FOLLOWING THE GOLD CROWN. THIS IS THE FIRST FULL USAC NATIONAL MIDGET CAMPAIGN FOR THOMAS AND HES ACTUALLY IN STRIKING RANGE OF OVERTAKING THIRD PLACE RICO ABREU, WHO HAS 588 POINTS. THOMAS TOP GOAL IS TO WIN HIS FIRST USAC NATIONAL EVENT. I REALLY WANT TO WIN BAD, HE SAID. ITS FRUSTRATING REALLY. WERE A LITTLE BIT OUT-EXPERIENCED, BUT I THINK ITS DOABLE. WE NEED TO GET ALL THE STARS ALIGN FOR A NIGHT. IT WOULD BE COOL TO FINISH AT LEAST THIRD IN THE POINTS. ITS THE FIRST TIME FOR US AT A LOT OF THESE TRACKS. THOMAS RACED IN THE GOLD CROWN AT THE THREE-EIGHTHS MILE TRACK IN 2013 AND MADE THE FEATURE ON ALL THREE NIGHTS. HIS BEST FINISH WAS 18TH. WEVE HAD A COUPLE OF GOOD RUNS THERE, BUT NOTHING SPECTACULAR, THOMAS SAID. IT WILL BE OUR FIRST TIME THERE WITH THE SPIKE. WELL HAVE A CLEAN SHEET OF PAPER AS FAR AS NOTES GO. I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT. THE GOLD CROWNS FORMAT DOESNT HAVE QUALIFYING, WHICH HASNT BEEN OUR STRENGTH, AND YOU LINE UP OFF THE DRAW AND HEATS. THAT SHOULD HELP US. THOMAS WILL RACE ON SUNDAY IN THE ASCS WARRIOR REGION IN JEFF SMITHS 360-CUBIC INCH WINGED SPRINT CAR AT RANDOLPH COUNTY RACEWAY IN MOBERLY, MO. HE HAS THREE TOP-FIVES IN SEVEN STARTS IN ASCS WARRIOR. THOMAS HAS RACED ONCE PREVIOUSLY AT RANDOLPH COUNTY, IN AN ASCS WARRIOR EVENT. WE ALMOST HAD A TOP FIVE, HE SAID. WE HAD A DRIVELINE FAILURE. IM REALLY EXCITED TO GO BACK. THOMAS FINISHED 15TH IN A COMBINED ASCS NATIONAL/WARRIOR FEATURE ON AUG. 23 AT THE MISSOURI STATE FAIR SPEEDWAY IN SEDALIA. HE WAS SEVENTH IN THE HEAT AND THIRD IN THE B FEATURE. WE WENT FROM STARTING EIGHTH TO THIRD IN THE B, THOMAS SAID. THE TRACK CAME TO US. WE STARTED 19TH IN THE FEATURE AND THE TRACK RUBBERED UP INTO ONE LINE AND WE FINISHED 15TH. THOMAS FINISHED FIFTH IN THE POWRI LUCAS OIL NATIONAL MIDGET SERIES ON AUG. 21 AT LINCOLN (ILL.) SPEEDWAY. HE FINISHED 19TH ON AUG. 18 AT SPRING RUN, PA., AND NINTH ON AUG. 19 AT OXFORD, PA., IN USAC NATIONAL MIDGETS. WE STARTED 11TH IN THE POWRI FEATURE AND WERE RACING FOR THIRD WHEN I WENT ABOVE THE CUSHION AND FELL TO SIXTH, THOMAS SAID. WE DIDNT HAVE ANY YELLOWS AFTER THE FIFTH LAP. THAT MISTAKE REALLY KILLED US. WE WERE RUNNING FOURTH AT SPRING RUN AND THATS PROBABLY WHERE WE WERE GOING TO FINISH, BUT WE BROKE A RIGHT REAR HUB. THE NEXT NIGHT, AT OXFORD, WE LACKED SOME SPEED IN QUALIFYING AND STARTED 15TH IN THE FEATURE. WE MADE SOME CHANGES FOR THE HEAT RACE AND GOT THE CAR WORKING VERY GOOD AND WON IT. WE HAD A PRETTY STRONG RUN TO NINTH IN THE FEATURE. TYLER THOMAS WILL DRIVE THE AMERICAN RACING CUSTOM WHEELS SPIKE-ESSLINGER FRIDAY AND SATURDAY IN THE GOLD CROWN NATIONALS, A HONDA USAC NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP EVENT, AT TRI-CITY SPEEDWAY IN GRANITE CITY, ILL. PADDOCKTALK PERSPECTIVE
2	ROB HALFORD LOOKS BACK ON PMRC: 'WE GOT ATTACKED FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER' SEPTEMBER 27, 2015 0 COMMENTS BACK IN THE MID-'80S, THE PMRC (PARENTS' MUSIC RESOURCE CENTER) PUBLISHED A LIST CALLED "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN" WHICH CONSISTED OF THE TOP FIFTEEN SONGS THEY WANTED BANNED DUE TO OBJECTIONABLE LYRICS SUGGESTING VIOLENCE, SEX, DRUGS, ALCOHOL OR THE OCCULT. THEY PETITIONED FOR LYRICS TO BE PRINTED ON THE ALBUM JACKETS AND NO ONE WAS SAFE HEAVY METAL ACTS WERE RIGHT THERE ALONGSIDE THE POP STARS. AC/DC, MADONNA, MTLEY CRE, JUDAS PRIEST, PRINCE, W.A.S.P., MERCYFUL FATE, VANITY, DEF LEPPARD, CYNDI LAUPER AND TWISTED SISTER ALL MADE "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN" LIST. IN NOVEMBER 1985, THE RIAA (RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA) AGREED TO PUT "PARENTAL ADVISORY: EXPLICIT LYRICS" LABELS ON SELECTED RELEASES AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION. ASKED WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO HAVE THE JUDAS PRIEST TRACK "EAT ME ALIVE" INCLUDED IN "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN," THE BAND'S LEAD SINGER, ROB HALFORD, TOLD CANADA'S C103 RADIO STATION: "IT WAS KIND OF TOUGH, BECAUSE WE GOT ATTACKED FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER. NONE OF US THAT ARE ON THAT LIST SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE, BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME SEE A BAND LIKE PRIEST OR MY MATE DEE [SNIDER] FROM TWISTED SISTER, WE WANNA GIVE YOU A GOOD TIME, WE WANNA HELP YOU FORGET ALL THE TROUBLES AND THE WORRIES IN THE WORLD. WE WANT YOU TO COME AND ENJOY YOURSELF, HAVE A FEW DRINKS, MEET YOUR MATES, HAVE A GREAT METAL EXPERIENCE, ROCK AND ROLL EXPERIENCE. SO, TO BE ACCUSED OF THAT WAS PRETTY LOW, BUT WE GOT THROUGH IT AND WE BATTLED ON, AND I THINK WE HAD A WIN FOR EVERYBODY IN THAT RESPECT." HALFORD ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE WAY SOCIETY HAS BECOME, IN HIS VIEW, TOO POLITICALLY CORRECT. HE SAID: "WELL, AGAIN, I COULD TALK FOREVER ON THAT SUBJECT. YOU KNOW, YEAH, I THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF GIVE EACH OTHER A BREAK AND KIND OF TAKE A LONG, DEEP BREATH AND LET IT OUT VERY SLOWLY, BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE CAN GET ATTENTION IN THESE TIMES IS TO SCREAM AS LOUD AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND TO SAY THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. SO IT'S A PITY, REALLY. IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD FROM WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AS A KID. BUT, HEY, THAT'S THE WAY HUMANITY IS EVOLVING, UNFORTUNATELY. AND IT'S NOT JUST IN THE STATES; IT'S EVERYWHERE. THERE'S THIS CRAZY CACOPHONY GOING ON. BUT LEAVE ALL THAT STUFF TO THE POLITICIANS AND TO ALL THE THE KIND OF NOISE THAT WE MAKE IN METAL IS THE BEST NOISE YOU CAN GET PLAIN AND SIMPLE." JUDAS PRIEST IS CONTINUING TO TOUR IN SUPPORT OF ITS LATEST ALBUM, "REDEEMER OF SOULS", WHICH WAS RELEASED IN JULY 2014. THE FOLLOW-UP TO 2008'S DOUBLE-DISC CONCEPT ALBUM "NOSTRADAMUS" WAS BILLED AS A RETURN TO JUDAS PRIEST'S HEAVY-METAL ROOTS. "REDEEMER OF SOULS" SOLD AROUND 32,000 COPIES IN THE UNITED STATES IN ITS FIRST WEEK OF RELEASE TO LAND AT POSITION NO. 6 ON THE BILLBOARD 200 CHART.

WALKING THROUGH THE QUAD: THE RISKS AND REWARDS IN A RUSH? IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A QUICK TRIP TO YOUR CLASSES, AVOID EYE CONTACT WITH PEOPLEESPECIALLY THOSE AT BOOTHSON THE QUAD. PUT YOUR HEADPHONES ON AND WALK FAST. BEWARE, ESPECIALLY, OF THE FIGHTING STALLIONS IN FRONT OF DERRICK AND NEXT TO EVANS. IT IS A KNOWN GATHERING SPOT FOR THOSE WISHING TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES. TIME TO SPARE? IF YOU HAVE TIME, STUDENT INVOLVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE OFFERED ON THE QUAD.

EVEN A LITTLE STUDYING GOES A LONG WAY! YOU DONT HAVE TO STUDY FOR SIX HOURS A DAY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND STUDYING IN SMALL, MEASURABLE INCREMENTS CAN PREVENT YOU FROM BEING OVERWHELMED NEARER TO MIDTERMS. 5. LEARN HOW TO WRITE E-MAILS TO YOUR PROFESSORS. THEY WONT TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY IF YOU BEGIN YOUR E-MAIL WITH HEY, SO, OR USE ALL LOWERCASE (OR WORSE, UPPERCASE) LETTERS AND FOREGO CORRECT PUNCTUATION. 6. MAKE FRIENDS IN YOUR CLASSES AND GET THEIR PHONE NUMBERS. YOU WILL HAVE QUESTIONS AT 2 A.M., AND SO WILL THEY. 7. JOIN AN ORGANIZATION! ITS THE FASTEST WAY TO MAKE FRIENDS, AND A GOOD EXCUSE TO GET OUT OF YOUR ROOM. 8. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ANOTHER ROOM BESIDES YOUR RESIDENCE HALL ROOM TO HANG OUT IN. TOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER CAN MAKE EVEN GOOD ROOMMATES IRRITABLE AND PRONE TO FIGHTING. 9. LEARN WHERE YOU CAN AND CANT PARK TO AVOID PARKING TICKETS. MAPS FOR PARKING ARE AVAILABLE HERE. 10.

4	12TH SEPTEMBER 2015 IF WE DID ALL THE THINGS WE WERE CAPABLE OF DOING, WE WOULD LITERALLY ASTONISH OURSELVES WELL THANK YOU RAIN, BEEN AWAKE SINCE EXACTLY 3.33AM, GOOD JOB I WENT TO BED EARLY OR I'D BE REALLY TIRED RIGHT NOW, INSTEAD I'M GOOD AND RARING TO GO. I HAD THE BEST DAY YESTERDAY TOO WHICH HELPS. HAD SOME MUCH ENJOYED ME TIME, AS MY BESTIE COULDN'T MAKE IT, I WAS GONNA DO THE HOUSEWORK THEN I THOUGHT NOPE, IT'S SUNNY, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN AND I FANCY ME A WALK AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I HAD. A COUPLE OF HOURS, ENJOYING THE SCENERY AND THE PEACE AND QUIET ON CANNOCK CHASE, NO 3G SIGNAL ON MY PHONE SO COMPLETE DISCONNECTEDNESS. I DO LOVE THE CHASE AND THE HEATHER LOOKS STUNNING AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, PLUS IT HELPED ME EARN 7 ACTIVITY PROPOINTS, BONUS! I THEN HAD ME AN HOUR ROUND THE SHOPS BEFORE GOING FOR MY MASSAGE, FINISHED MY DAY OFF BY COOKING MYSELF A DELICIOUS TEA, STEAK AND SPAGHETTI, IT WORKS AND WAS DELICIOUS. I WAS GOING TO GARDEN TODAY BUT WITH THE RAIN THAT'S GOING ON AT THE MOMENT, I DON'T THINK I WILL BE, INSTEAD I'LL SPEND SOME TIME IN THE KITCHEN I THINK POSSIBLY OR CHILLING WITH MY MOM, WHO KNOWS I MAY CONSIDER THE HOUSEWORK, I KEEP PUTTING THAT OFF. WHAT'S STOPPING ME? PROCRASTINATION IF I'M HONEST, PLAN OLD PUTTING IT OFF, I JUST FIND IT A LITTLE TEDIOUS, ACTUALLY A BIT OVERWHELMING, I KNOW IT'S A BIG JOB AND IT'S JUST GETTING STARTED THAT SUCKS, ONCE I'M INTO IT, I ACTUALLY START TO ENJOY IT AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE RESULTS. MMM AM I TALKING ABOUT MY HOUSEWORK THERE OR HOW SO MANY OF US FEEL ABOUT SORTING OUR EATING HABITS OUT AND TACKLING OUR WEIGHT! SO LET'S CHANGE THIS NOW TO WEIGHT, BECAUSE I'D BE AVOIDING THE ISSUE IF I PRETENDED PEOPLE DON'T DISAPPEAR FROM MEETINGS IN THE SUMMER, THEY DO. WE'RE MORE SIMILAR THAN WE CARE TO ADMIT, THEN ONCE THE KIDS GO BACK TO SCHOOL OR WE'VE HAD OUR HOLIDAYS WE PUT OFF RETURNING TO OUR MEETING, THEN WE REALISE CHRISTMAS IS ON THE WAY AND WE FINALLY GET BACK ON IT. SO WHAT'S STOPPING YOU? BECAUSE LET'S BE HONEST, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT TO MAKE HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHANGES AND IT'S ALL TOO EASY TO PUT IT OFF. HERE'S A THOUGHT, BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE PUTTING IT OFF IS JUST DOWN TO LACK OF MOTIVATION OR LAZINESS, DID YOU KNOW THAT PROCRASTINATION CAN SOMETIMES BE A SIGN OF LOW SELF-ESTEEM! YOU'RE DELAYING STARTING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SUBCONSCIOUS FEAR THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO FAIL, IS THAT WHAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK? WELL GO TELL YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS TO DO ONE BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO SUCCEED, MAKE REALISTIC CHANGES AND TWEAKS, GET YOURSELF THE SUPPORT YOU NEED AND YOU WILL DO THIS. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE HOUSEWORK, BEFORE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE SUCH HARD WORK AND UNENJOYABLE, WELL WE CAN FEEL LIKE THAT ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS, BUT ONCE WE SEE THOSE RESULTS AND REALISE WE CAN HAVE FUN, EAT DELICIOUS FOOD AND STILL LOSE WEIGHT, WE WONDER WHY WE EVER PUT OFF STARTING. BREAK IT DOWN, SET YOURSELF SMALL GOALS, YES WE ALL HAVE AN OVERALL TARGET, BUT BY SETTING MINI WEIGHT LOSS GOALS, IT'LL KEEP YOU GOING WEEK BY WEEK. THEN THERE'S THE PLATEAU, WE ALL HIT THEM, ONCE THE HONEYMOON PERIOD OF WEIGHT LOSS JOURNEY WEARS OFF, YOU KNOW THAT FIRST FEW WEEKS OF WOO HOO GREAT WEIGHT LOSS, ONCVE IT SLOWS DOWN AND PEOPLE STOP NOTICING, WE CAN START TO FORGET WHY WE STARTED, THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO SIT DOWN AND MAKE A LIST OF WHY YOU STARTED, WHAT'S IMPROVED IN YOUR LIFE SINCE YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT AND HOW IT'S GOING TO CARRY ON GETTING BETTER. AND DON'T GIVE ME THE "I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT THIS WEEK" LINE, I USE THAT TOO OFTEN MYSELF. I KNOW MOST OF THE TIME WE HAVE A TO DO LIST LONGER THAN OUR ARM, AND THE THOUGHT OF ADDING TO IT MAKES US SHUDDER. BUT REALLY ISN'T PRIORITISING OUR WELLBEING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD, BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DO THAT, ONE DAY WE'LL GET SICK AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. ROUTINE HELPS HERE, GET INTO THE HABIT OF SPENDING 15 MINUTES PLANNING YOUR MEALS FOR THE WEEK, OR ALLOCATE 20 MINUTES A DAY TO HAVING A WALK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE TO DO WALKING SO IT'S THE QUICKEST AND EASIEST ACTIVITY, JUST POP ON YOUR TRAINERS AND WALK FROM WHERE YOU ARE. COOKING FROM SCRATCH DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TIME CONSUMING, MY TEA TOOK 15 MINUTES YESTERDAY AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE THE SPAGHETTI TAKES 11 MINUTES TO COOK AS I USED FROZEN VEGETABLES FOR QUICKNESS SO NO CHOPPING. SO COME ON NO MORE EXCUSES, ACKNOWLEDGE YOU'RE PUTTING IT OFF AND HONESTLY ANSWER THE QUESTION "WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?" THEN REALISE IT'S AN EXCUSE AND GET STARTED, IF YOU'RE ALREADY DOING IT, GO YOU! I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING MY BEYOUTIFUL MEMBERS THIS MORNING, THEY'RE DOING IT, THEY REALISE IT WORKS AND THEY'RE ENJOYING THE JOURNEY. HERE'S TO A GREAT WEEKEND - YOU IN? AND YES I AM GOING TO TACKLE THE HOUSEWORK, I'VE TALKED MYSELF ROUND!

THIS CHARITABLE PROJECT IS PART OF THE KENNEDY CENTERS ADOPT-A-HOME PROGRAM. VOLUNTEERING CAN BE FUN. BUT ITS EVEN BETTER IF YOU CAN ENJOY THE GREAT OUTDOORS AND CREATE SOMETHING NEW. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SIX MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM FROM BIGELOW TEA IN FAIRFIELD DID TO HELP OUT KENNEDY CENTER CLIENTS. THEY SPENT HALF THE DAY BUILDING AND PLANTING A RAISED VEGETABLE GARDEN AT THE DAN SMITH GROUP HOME IN MONROE. THIS CHARITABLE PROJECT IS PART OF THE KENNEDY CENTERS ADOPT-A-HOME PROGRAM, WHICH UNITES A GROUP HOME WITH BUSINESSES, CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN NEW HAVEN AND FAIRFIELD COUNTIES. BIGELOW TEA WAS THE FIRST COMPANY TO VOLUNTEER WITH THE KENNEDY CENTER ON THIS INITIATIVE AND HAS PREVIOUSLY WORKED ON OTHER AREA GROUPS HOMES. IN ADDITION TO SUPPLYING THE MANPOWER, BIGELOW TEA PURCHASED ALL THE SUPPLIES, INCLUDING THE PLANTS, SOIL, WOOD BOXES AND FENCING. THE KENNEDY CENTER CLIENTS SAY THEY ARE ENJOYING THE FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR AND HAVE FRESH HERBS, CABBAGE, SQUASH AND TOMATOES TO USE IN THEIR SALADS. ACCORDING TO MARTIN D.

8	THERE'S A RESIDENT EVIL IN HARLEM. AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE ZOMBIES . IT WAS EARLY AFTERNOON WHEN THE MAN WITH THE TWITCHING LEGS WAS DRAGGED FROM THE GROUND INTO AN AMBULANCE. ANOTHER MAN SELLING BOOKS WASHED AWAY THE VOMIT. A MAN NAMED CHARLIE MEDINA SAT AT THE SAME SPOT A FEW DAYS LATER, UNABLE TO REMEMBER HIS NAME BEFORE HE FELL INTO A TRANCE WITH HIS JAW OPEN AND HIS EYES DILATED. AND THE LOVERS. THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND A ROOM. ONE PULLED OFF THE OTHERS SHIRT AND HER BRA, THEN STARTED TO KISS HER BRUISED BREASTS WHILE A SMALL CROWD GATHERED TO WATCH. THE PEOPLE HERE ON THIS STRETCH OF 125TH STREET IN EAST HARLEM MAY CHANGE, BUT THE DRUG REMAINS THE SAME: K2 , ALSO CALLED SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA, A POTENT MIX OF HERBS AND CHEMICALS THAT HAS BECOME WIDELY USED AMONG HOMELESS PEOPLE IN NEW YORK CITY. CROWDS OF UP TO 80 OR 100 HOMELESS PEOPLE COME IN ON BUSES FROM A NEARBY SHELTER ON RANDALLS ISLAND, DRAWN BY HEROIN RECOVERY CLINICS NEARBY, AND SPEND THE DAY THERE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS CHEAPER NARCOTIC. THE BLOCK BETWEEN PARK AND LEXINGTON AVENUES APPEARS AT TIMES TO BE A STREET OF ZOMBIES. THE ZOMBIES ARE JUST A SYMPTOM OF THE PROBLEM. THE RESIDENT EVIL I WAS REFERREDTO ABOVE IS THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY, WHICH REFUSES TO CLEAR THESE ADDICTS OFF THE STREETS. THIS ISN'T THE KIND OF CRIME THAT REQUIRES FANCY DETECTIVE WORK TO SOLVE; THESE PEOPLE ARE SO OUT IN THE OPEN, LYING ON BUSY STREETS, THAT THEY CAN'T BE AVOIDED. THE REASON THEY ARE THERE IS BECAUSE OF LAX LAWS ABOUT HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS, LAX LAWS FOR DRUG ADDICTS (I BELIEVE LIBERALS AND RAND PAUL CALL IT "DECRIMINALIZING LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS"), AND A LACK OF WILL ON THE PART OF THE POLICE TO KEEP THE STREETS SAFE AND CLEAR. AND THE LACK OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE POLICE COMES FROM THE TOP, FROM COMMISSAR DE BLASIO. IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS HARLEM HAS BECOME A TRENDY PLACE TO LIVE FOR WHITE LIBERALS, WHO WOULD SPEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR BROWNSTONES IN DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOODS. ON THE UPSIDE, THE PRICE OF DRUGS AND PROSTITUTES ARE PROBABLY CHEAPER THERE. I ALSO KNOW THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS AN OFFICE THERE. KEEPING THE STREETS CLEAR OF DRUG ADDICTS IS NOT A DIFFICULT THING. WHEN SOCIETY HAS LOST THE WILL TO FIGHT BACK, THE STREETS BECOME LITTERED WITH DISGUSTING AND INSANE ZOMBIE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO DRUGGED UP THAT THEY THINK NOTHING OF VOMITING, DEFECATING, OR COPULATING ON A PUBLIC SIDEWALK.

9	LAST POST IN THIS THREAD I MENTIONED THAT I HAD OBTAINED SOME 'HONDURAN' MAHOGANY FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD ON THE CABINET. I WASN'T ENTIRELY PLEASED WITH THE MATERIAL I RECEIVED AS I HAD WANTED QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY, WHILE 7 OUT OF THE 10 BOARDS RECEIVED WERE NOT FITTING THAT DESCRIPTION AT ALL. I REALIZE NOW THAT QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY IS NOT GENERALLY WHAT WAS BEING CUT - LOGS ARE INVARIABLY SAWN THROUGH AND THROUGH - AND THUS QS STOCK IS LESS COMMONLY AVAILABLE THAN I HAD THOUGHT. SO, TRYING TO OBTAIN MORE (IN BULK) IN THE HOPE OF SCORING SOME MORE QUARTERSAWN BOARDS WAS NOT LOOKING PROMISING. NONE OF THE RETAILERS I SPOKE WITH SEEMED EVEN WILLING TO DO A SORT FOR A FEW BOARDS, AND FAIR ENOUGH. AFTER FURTHER RUMINATION, I DECIDED IT WOULD BE BEST TO CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SPECIES FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD, A SPECIES THAT WAS TYPICALLY CUT FOR QUARTERSAWN FROM THE GET-GO AND WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD MATCH FOR THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE REST OF THE CABINET. I'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED WOODS SUCH AS MAHOGANY, BLACK CHERRY, AND SWISS PEAR WOOD FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD. NONE OF THOSE WERE LIKELY TO FIT THE REQUIREMENTS I HAD IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION, SO I KEPT LOOKING. I FINALLY CAME ACROSS A SUITABLE MATERIAL, AND IT IS BOTANICALLY RELATED TO BUBINGA (WHICH IS GUIBORTIA TESSMANII OR GUIBORTIA PELLAGRINIANA OR GUIBORTIA DEMEUSEI). THIS IS A WOOD CALLED SHEDUA, AKA OVANGKOL, WHICH COMES FROM THE SPECIES GUIBORTIA EHIE. THIS IS A SOMEWHAT SMALLER TREE THAN THOSE SPECIES FROM WHICH BUBINGA IS OBTAINED, HOWEVER IN MANY RESPECTS SHEDUA SHARES THE SAME WORKING QUALITIES AS BUBINGA. THE WOOD COMES FROM WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES LIKE GABON AND CAMEROON, AND THE TREE IS MORE COMMONLY UTILIZED FOR ITS GUM RESIN, CALLED CONGO COPAL, THAN ITS TIMBER. THE TIMBER IS NOT VERY COMMONLY AVAILABLE, AND DOES SEEM TO FIND A CERTAIN FAVOR AMONG THE GUITAR-MAKING COMMUNITY. HERE'S A GUITAR WITH A SHEDUA BACK: (FROM:HTTP://WWW.GUITARBENCH.COM/2012/01/04/SHEDUA-TONEWOOD-PROFILE/) AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS A MORE BROWNISH CAST THAN BUBINGA, BUT SHARES THE BLACK STREAKS. COMPARING SHEDUA'S MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WITH BUBINGA, IT IS VERY CLOSE INDEED, BEING VERY SLIGHTLY LIGHTER AND DENSER, A LITTLE LOWER IN VOLUMETRIC CHANGE DUE TO MOISTURE CONTENT CHANGE, A SLIGHT BIT SOFTER IN TERMS OF CRUSHING STRENGTH AND A HAIR STIFFER IN BENDING STRENGTH (MODULUS OF ELASTICITY). I IMAGINE, THEREFORE, THAT IT SHOULD HAVE FAIRLY SIMILAR WORKING QUALITIES TO BUBINGA. THIS IMAGE FROM HEARNE HARDWOODS SHOWS THE VARIED APPEARANCE OF SHEDUA BASED ON THE GRAIN ORIENTATION: AS IT SO HAPPENS, HEARNE WAS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THE US WHICH HAD ANY STOCK OF SHEDUA AT ALL, LET ALONE QS AND/OR FIGURED STOCK. IN FACT, THEY HAD A DECENTLY SIZED STACK OF 12/4 MATERIAL, 6~12" WIDE, 16' LONG OR LONGER, AND SOME OF IT WAS QUARTERSAWN. CONSIDERING FEW OTHER RETAILERS HAVE ANY OF THIS MATERIAL, IT WAS AMAZING TO COME ACROSS SUCH NICE STOCK. THEY ALSO TOOK TIME TO REPLY TO MY EMAILS, AND SEND PICTURES, ONCE I HAD DEMONSTRATED SOLID INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL - - AND HAD GIVEN THEM MY CREDIT CARD INFO! THEY SEEM TO BE A WOOD RETAILER SPECIALIZING IN HIGH QUALITY AND RARE MATERIALS. THEY SENT ME SOME PICTURES OF A COUPLE OF BOARDS WHICH MATCHED THE REQUIREMENTS I GAVE THEM, SWABBED WITH ALCOHOL TO MAKE THE FIGURE A BIT CLEARER THOUGH NOT SHOWING THE TONE WHICH WILL BE OBTAINED WITH A PROPER FINISH: THEY WERE WONDERING IF I WAS SO DETERMINED TO HAVE QUARTERSAWN BECAUSE I WAS A LUTHIER, HOWEVER I LET THEM KNOW THEY WERE GUESSING WRONG. I DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC REASONS FOR WANTING QUARTERSAWN MATERIAL OF COURSE. THE GUY WHO SENT ME THE PICTURES STATED THAT THESE TWO BOARDS MIGHT BE THE NICEST IN THE ENTIRE PILE. I ASKED FOR A FOLLOW-UP PIC OF THE END GRAIN OF THE TWO BOARDS, TO CONFIRM THEY WERE WHAT I WANTED IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION: AND THE OTHER BOARD, ABOUT 12" WIDE: THE STICKS ARE HARD TO SCALE UNTIL YOU NOTICE THAT A FORKLIFT IS DOING THE LIFTING.... THE STOCK LOOKED GOOD TO ME. THE PRICE WAS STEEP, AT $35/BOARD FOOT, SO EACH OF THOSE BOARDS WAS $1400.00, HOWEVER I WAS ABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE COST SOMEWHAT BY SELLING A PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY-ACQUIRED MAHOGANY OFF TO ANOTHER WOODWORKER IN MY BUILDING. I ORDERED THOSE TWO BOARDS AND THEY SHOULD BE AT MY SHOP IN ANOTHER 3~4 DAYS. I THINK THIS WOOD WILL GO VERY NICELY WITH THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE BULK OF THE CABINET: I THINK THE CAD REPRESENTATION OF THE SHEDUA IS APPROXIMATE AT BEST. IN RECENT DAYS I HAVE REVISED THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DIVIDERS ON THE LOWER BANK OF DRAWERS, MAKING THEM STRAIGHT INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM MATCH THE DRAWER CURVES, AND RECESSING THEM BACK SLIGHTLY - THIS FOR AMONG OTHER REASONS, TO INCREASE THE SHADOW LINE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE CURVED DRAWERS AND THE SURROUNDING FRAMEWORK: THE DIVIDER'S OUTER ARRISES WILL ADDITIONALLY BE CHAMFERED. THE DRAWERS THEMSELVES WILL HAVE A BEADED PERIMETER DETAIL, AND HAVE THE DRAWER SIDEWALL THROUGH- TENONS POKING OUT, NEITHER OF WHICH IS NOT ILLUSTRATED YET, AND THE HANDLE DESIGN FOR THE DRAWERS REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION. LIKEWISE, THE UPPER SET OF DRAWERS AND DOORS REMAINS JUST A FRONTAL PLANE AT THE MOMENT WITH NO ALLOWANCE FOR SET BACK, CHAMFERING, ETC.. GETTING THERE! THANKS FOR VISITING THE CARPENTRY WAY. GOT SOME MACHINE'S COMING SOON SO I AM WORKING ON GETTING MY SHOP READY FOR THAT - THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE SUBJECT OF THE NEXT POST.

12	THE COMPANY'S NEW PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HELP CHINESE COMPANIES WORKING IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS INDUSTRY AS IF CHINESE FACTORIES WEREN'T ALREADY PRODUCING ENOUGH OF OUR GADGETS, CHIP DESIGNER ARM HOLDINGS WANTS TO HELP CHINESE STARTUPS PRODUCE MORE WEARABLE DEVICES, ROBOTS AND SMART HOME PRODUCTS. TO THAT END, THE U.K. COMPANY IS SETTING UP AN "ACCELERATOR" IN BEIJING STAFFED WITH EXPERTS WHO CAN PROVIDE CHINESE COMPANIES WITH TIPS ON PRODUCT DESIGN INCLUDING WHICH CHIPS OR SOFTWARE TO USE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME ARM HAS CREATED SUCH A PROGRAM, AND ITS AIM IS TO REMOVE ANY BARRIERS THAT MIGHT HINDER CHINESE STARTUPS FROM QUICKLY DELIVERING THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COUNTRY IS ALREADY HOME TO NUMEROUS COMPANIES, LARGE AND SMALL, DEVELOPING SMARTPHONES, WEARABLES AND OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES. HOWEVER, LOCAL STARTUPS TYPICALLY POSSESS FEW RESOURCES, AND NOT ENOUGH KNOW-HOW TO QUICKLY DELIVER THEIR PRODUCTS, ACCORDING TO ARM. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE INCLUDE SELECTING THE RIGHT COMPONENTS, OPTIMIZING THE DEVICE'S SOFTWARE, OR FINDING OUT WHICH OPERATING SYSTEM BEST FITS THEIR NEEDS. ARM'S ACCELERATOR PROGRAM WANTS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES BY PROVIDING WORKSHOPS, TRAINING AND DESIGN SERVICES RELATING TO THE COMPANY'S OWN CHIP DESIGNS. THE U.K. COMPANY IS BEST KNOWN FOR SUPPLYING THE PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY USED IN MOST SMARTPHONE AND TABLETS. BUT ARM ALSO WANTS TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS INTO IOT AREAS SUCH AS SMART CITIES, SMART HOMES AND HEALTHCARE, WHERE ITS LOW-POWER CONSUMING PROCESSORS COULD FLOURISH. LAST YEAR, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS MBED PLATFORMTO HELP VENDORS BUILD IOT SYSTEMS. SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT ARM'S ACCELERATOR IN CHINA WILL ALSO BE OFFERING DESIGN SERVICES AROUND MBED. BUT ON MONDAY IN BEIJING, ARM'S CEO SIMON SEGARS SAID THAT THE ACCELERATOR WILL ALSO OPEN ITSELF TO OTHER IOT PLATFORMS FROM OTHER COMPANIES. THE GOAL IS TO ESSENTIALLY CONNECT CHINESE STARTUPS WITH THE APPROPRIATE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS, MANY OF WHOM ARE ALREADY PARTNERS WITH ARM, HE ADDED. THE ACCELERATOR WILL WORK THROUGH A COMPANY ARM HAS ESTABLISHED WITH BEIJING-BASEDTHUNDERSOFT, WHICH ALREADYSPECIALIZES IN HELPING SMARTPHONE AND TABLET VENDORS REFINE THE SOFTWARE ON THEIR DEVICES.THE ACCELERATOR'S FIRST OFFICE WILL BE BASED IN BEIJING, BUT TO REACH MORE STARTUPS, FOUR OR FIVE OTHER OFFICES WILL BE SET UP ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO. ALL CHINESE COMPANIES ARE INVITED TO JOIN. THE NEW PROGRAM WILL SURELY HELP PROMOTE ARM'S CHIP DESIGNS AND SOFTWARE, BUT IT COULD ALSO ASSIST CHINESE VENDORS IN CREATING SUCCESSFUL IOT PRODUCTS,SAID KITTY FOK, AN ANALYST WITH RESEARCH FIRM IDC. IN THE FUTURE, ARM COULD EVEN ADVISE THESE CHINESE STARTUPS ON WHAT OPPORTUNITIES ARE EMERGING IN THE MARKET, OR WHICH CUSTOMERS TO TARGET, SHE ADDED.
13	SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- (MARKETWIRED) -- 09/08/15 -- " EARLOBE REPAIR IS A POPULAR PROCEDURE AMONG BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AT MY PRACTICE," STATES SAN FRANCISCO PLASTIC SURGEON KAREN HORTON, MD . "WOMEN USUALLY WISH TO ADDRESS STRETCHED OUT EAR PIERCINGS OR TORN EARLOBES, AND MEN OFTEN WANT TO CORRECT SIZEABLE HOLES RESULTING FROM LARGE DISCS -- KNOWN AS GAUGES -- INSERTED IN THEIR EARLOBES THAT WERE ONCE DESIRED BUT NO LONGER FIT WITH THEIR CURRENT LOOK. IN ADDITION TO THESE CONCERNS, MANY MEN AND WOMEN ALSO SEE ME FOR KELOID SCARS IN THE EARS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED FROM PAST PIERCINGS, INFECTIONS, OR TRAUMA." FOR INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN EARLOBE REPAIR, DR. HORTON SAYS SHE FIRST OBTAINS A COMPLETE MEDICAL HISTORY AND CONDUCTS A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE TARGETED AREA DURING AN INITIAL CONSULTATION. SHOULD SHE DETERMINE THAT EARLOBE CORRECTION SURGERY WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OPTION FOR THE PATIENT'S UNIQUE NEEDS -- AS OPPOSED TO NONSURGICAL EARLOBE REJUVENATION VIA FILLERS -- THE PROCEDURE IS DISCUSSED IN EXTENSIVE DETAIL, AND A SURGICAL DATE IS SCHEDULED IF THE PATIENT WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED. ON THE DAY OF SURGERY, THE SAN FRANCISCO PLASTIC SURGEON NOTES THAT THE TREATMENT AREA IS MARKED, AND THE PATIENT VISUALLY CONFIRMS WHAT IS TO BE PERFORMED. NEXT, LOCAL ANESTHESIA IS ADMINISTERED, AND THE PROCEDURE IS CONDUCTED UNDER MAGNIFICATION TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF ACCURACY AND PRECISION. "DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION," DR. HORTON WRITES IN A RECENT BLOG POST OVERVIEWING EARLOBE REPAIR , "EXCESS SCARRING, SKIN, OR TISSUE IS REMOVED, AND THE REMAINING EARLOBE TISSUE IS 'LOCALLY REARRANGED' TO CREATE A MORE NORMAL APPEARING EARLOBE." IF A PIERCING IS STILL DESIRED AFTER THE OPERATION, THE EARLOBE CAN ALSO BE RE-PIERCED AT THE TIME OF SURGERY. IN REGARD TO RECOVERY FROM EARLOBE REPAIR , DR. HORTON EXPLAINS THAT SOME TEMPORARY SWELLING AND/OR BRUISING CAN BE EXPECTED INITIALLY, BUT THESE SIDE EFFECTS SHOULD DIMINISH RELATIVELY QUICKLY. "DOWNTIME IS TYPICALLY MINIMAL, WITH MOST INDIVIDUALS RETURNING TO WORK AND/OR NORMAL DAILY ROUTINES THE DAY AFTER THEIR PROCEDURE. THAT SAID, PATIENTS ARE ADVISED TO AVOID STRENUOUS ACTIVITIES AND RIGOROUS EXERCISE FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE TO TWO WEEKS IN ORDER TO HELP ENSURE PROPER HEALING." ULTIMATELY, WHEN PERFORMED BY AN EXPERIENCED BOARD CERTIFIED PLASTIC SURGEON, DR. HORTON STATES THAT EARLOBE REPAIR CAN BE AN EXCEPTIONALLY GRATIFYING PROCEDURE FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS, ENABLING THEM TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR EARLOBES. ABOUT KAREN HORTON, MD CERTIFIED BY THE AMERICAN BOARD OF PLASTIC SURGERY, DR. HORTON OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF COSMETIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE PROCEDURES FOR THE BREASTS, FACE, AND BODY, AS WELL AS SEVERAL NONSURGICAL SKIN CARE AND MED-SPA TREATMENTS. SHE IS A FELLOW OF BOTH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS AND THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS OF CANADA, AND SHE REMAINS ACTIVE IN THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS, THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS, AND VARIOUS OTHER PRESTIGIOUS MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS. ABOVE ALL, DR. HORTON IS DEVOTED TO ENSURING EVERY PATIENT RECEIVES THE SAFEST, MOST EFFECTIVE CARE POSSIBLE FOR THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS AND DESIRES.

14	THE BLACKBERRY VENICE, THE SLIDER SMARTPHONE THAT HAS BEEN LEAKED SO MANY TIMES IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, IS ALMOST READY TO HIT RETAIL SHELVES, BUT NOT AS BLACKBERRY VENICE. (PHOTO : EVAN BLASS | TWITTER) BLACKBERRY FANS WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE TRAIL OF LEAKS LEADING UP TO THE BLACKBERRY VENICE WILL BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT BLACKBERRY VENICE WILL NOT HIT RETAIL STORES. INSTEAD, THE SLIDER SMARTPHONE THAT WILL ALSO BE BLACKBERRY'S FIRST ANDROID PHONE WILL BE SOLD AS THE BLACKBERRY PRIV. PROMINENT LEAKER EVAN BLASS, BETTER KNOWN BY HIS TWITTER HANDLE @EVLEAKS, SHARED THE NEWS ON HIS TWITTER PAGE. AT RETAIL, VENICE TRANSFORMS INTO THE... BLACKBERRY PRIV EVAN BLASS (@EVLEAKS) SEPTEMBER 23, 2015 WHILE MANY PEOPLE MAY BE DISAPPOINTED IN BLACKBERRY'S NAME CHOICE FOR ITS MUCH ANTICIPATED SMARTPHONE, IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR THE COMPANY TO NAME THE DEVICE PRIV INSTEAD. IT'S SHORT AND SNAPPY, MAKING IT JUST RIGHT FOR ITS ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT STANDS FOR THE PRIVACY-MINDED FOCUS FOR ALL BLACKBERRY PRODUCTS. STILL, VENICE DOES ROLL OFF THE TONGUE QUITE NICELY. SO LONG, VENICE. HELLO, PRIV. BLASS ALSO POSTED A BRAND NEW RENDER OF THE BLACKBERRY VENICE, ERR, BLACKBERRY PRIV ON TWITTER. THE IMAGE DOESN'T TELL US ANYTHING WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW, BUT IT DOES CONFIRM EARLIER REPORTS THAT THE SMARTPHONE WILL RUN ON NEARLY STOCK ANDROID WITH A FEW BLACKBERRY FEATURES. IT ALSO SHOWS THE PHYSICAL KEYBOARD SLIDING OUT FROM UNDER THE HUGE DISPLAY, AS WELL AS THE BLACKBERRY LOGO ON TOP OF THE DISPLAY. . @CRACKBERRY THAT RENDER IS GETTING A BIT TIRED, DONTCHA THINK? PIC.TWITTER.COM/UZSANAU6DF EVAN BLASS (@EVLEAKS) SEPTEMBER 24, 2015 MEANWHILE, THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE MORE COLOR ON THE UPCOMING BLACKBERRY HANDSET MAY CHECK OUT A GROUP OF NEW RENDERS DEVELOPED BY DESIGNER @POOTERMOBILE. WHEN BLACKBERRY PRESIDENT OF DEVICES AND EMERGING SOLUTIONS RON LOUKS TEASED BLACKBERRY PRIV AT THE MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS IN MARCH, HE ONLY SHOWED A DEVICE IN BLACK AND WHITE. THESE NEW RENDERS ADDING RED, PURPLE, SILVER AND SKY BLUE, HOWEVER, LEND AN INTERESTING TWIST TO THE SMARTPHONE. WHILE THE BLACKBERRY PRIV MAY OFFICIALLY LAUNCH ONLY IN BLACK AND WHITE, IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR BLACKBERRY TO RELEASE NEW COLORS AFTERWARDS. AFTER ALL, THE SQUARE-DISPLAY BLACKBERRY PASSPORT HAD A LIMITED EDITION IN RED, AND THE REDESIGNED SMARTPHONE CAME IN SILVER. NO RELEASE DATE HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED FOR THE BLACKBERRY PRIV, BUT AS THE NUMEROUS LEAKS AND EVEN A HANDS-ON VIDEO POINT OUT, IT'S LIKE THE NEW SMARTPHONE WILL BE UNVEILED SOON ENOUGH. THE BLACKBERRY PRIV IS SHAPING UP TO BE A PRETTY INTERESTING DEVICE, WITH A SNAPDRAGON 810 SOC, 3 GB OF RAM, A 5.4-INCH QUAD HD DISPLAY, AN 18-MEGAPIXEL BACK CAMERA AND A 5-MEGAPIXEL FRONT SHOOTER.

15	NORTH CARROLL HIGH SCHOOL HONORED ED POWELSON SIX YEARS AGO BY NAMING ITS STADIUM FIELD AFTER THE MAN WHO DEVOTED ALMOST ALL OF HIS ADULT LIFE TO HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS IN HAMPSTEAD, AND SEVERAL COUNTY SPORTS FIGURES ATTENDED THE CEREMONY. ONE OF THEM WAS GEORGE WUNDER, A 1992 NORTH CARROLL GRAD AND LONGTIME BASKETBALL COACH AT CENTURY HIGH. HE WANTED THE PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE TO KNOW HOW MUCH POWELSON IMPACTED HIS LIFE, AND MANY OTHERS, AS A COACH, ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, AND ROLE MODEL. "NO ONE EVER CARED ABOUT NORTH CARROLL MORE," WUNDER SAID THAT DAY, "THAN MR. POWELSON." LRELATED WESTMINSTERASCENSION EPISCOPAL CHURCH HOLDS BLESSING OF THE ANIMALSSEE ALL RELATED 8 POWELSON, ONE OF CARROLL COUNTY'S MORE RECOGNIZABLE SPORTS FIGURES, DIED SUNDAY AFTER A LONG BATTLE WITH CANCER. HE WAS 77. POWELSON COACHED BOYS SOCCER AT NORTH CARROLL FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS AND FINISHED HIS COACHING CAREER WITH 274 WINS THE MOST IN STATE HISTORY FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL COACH WHEN HE RETIRED IN 1995 TO GO WITH 46 COMBINED COUNTY, CONFERENCE AND REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS. HE WAS INDUCTED INTO THE CARROLL COUNTY SPORTS HALL OF FAME IN 2001, AND LATER THIS WEEK NORTH CARROLL WILL BEGIN ITS SEVENTH FALL SPORTS SEASON WITH GAMES PLAYED ON POWELSON FIELD. CCOMMENTS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY? START THE CONVERSATION AND BE THE FIRST TO COMMENT. ADD A COMMENT 0 TROY WAREHIME, NORTH CARROLL'S ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, SPOKE DURING A CEREMONY IN 2006 WHEN POWELSON BECAME THE FIRST MEMBER OF NC'S SPORTS HALL OF FAME. THREE YEARS LATER, HE SPOKE AGAIN AT THE POWELSON FIELD DEDICATION CEREMONY. WAREHIME IS PLANNING TO SAY SOME WORDS ABOUT POWELSON LATER THIS WEEK AT ONE OF POWELSON'S MEMORIAL SERVICES. "THIS TIME WON'T BE SO EASY," WAREHIME SAID. "HE WAS MY HERO." POWELSON HAILED FROM RIDGELEY, WEST VIRGINIA, GRADUATED FROM FAIRMONT STATE COLLEGE IN 1959, AND CAME TO CARROLL COUNTY IN 1961, WHEN HE TOOK A JOB TEACHING PHYSICAL EDUCATION AT HAMPSTEAD ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS. HE DECLINED AN OFFER TO BECOME A PE TEACHER AT NORTH CARROLL HIGH THE FOLLOWING YEAR. WHEN IT WAS OFFERED AGAIN THE NEXT YEAR, HE ACCEPTED. "I FIGURED THEY WOULDN'T ASK THREE TIMES," POWELSON SAID IN A 1997 TIMES ARTICLE. POWELSON COACHED TRACK AND FIELD, BASKETBALL, AND SOCCER TO START, THEN ADDED GYMNASTICS TO HIS RESUME. HE ALSO INHERITED ATHLETIC DIRECTOR DUTIES, EVEN THOUGH SUCH A POSITION DIDN'T REALLY EXIST BACK THEN. "I WAS THE ONLY COACH," POWELSON SAID IN THE 1997 ARTICLE. "AND YOU DID ALL THE SCHEDULING, YOU DID EVERYTHING, EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T CALLED ATHLETIC DIRECTORS AND WE DIDN'T GET PAID A CENT FOR ANY OF IT, WHICH WAS FINE. "THAT WASN'T A PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT WASN'T WHY YOU GET IN TEACHING OR COACHING. YOU WERE IN IT FOR THE LOVE OF IT." POWELSON'S BOYS SOCCER TEAMS WON 20 COUNTY TITLES BETWEEN 1961 AND 1988 AND ENJOYED A 46-GAME WINNING STREAK. HE STEPPED AWAY FROM COACHING IN 1995, AND LEFT HIS POST AS ATHLETIC DIRECTOR IN 1997, WRAPPING UP A TEACHING AND COACHING CAREER THAT SPANNED FOUR DECADES. "HE TAUGHT KIDS, HE TAUGHT THEIR PARENTS, AND HE MIGHT HAVE TAUGHT A FEW OF THEIR GRANDPARENTS," WAREHIME SAID. POWELSON HELPED INTRODUCE THE ATHLETIC TRAINER PROGRAM TO CARROLL IN THE 1980S; HE HELPED FORM THE MONOCACY VALLEY ATHLETIC LEAGUE IN 1972 AND THE CENTRAL MARYLAND CONFERENCE IN THE '80S; AND HE WAS INDUCTED INTO THE MARYLAND STATE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR HALL OF FAME IN 1998. "THEY SORT OF BROKE THE MOLD WITH ED," SAID JIM RODRIGUEZ, CARROLL'S SUPERVISOR OF ATHLETICS, AT THE 2009 FIELD-NAMING CEREMONY. "IT'S ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE HE TOUCHED AND THE LIFE LESSONS HE GAVE THEM BEYOND THE FIELD." WHEN NORTH CARROLL'S FOOTBALL TEAM HAD THE FIRST HOME PLAYOFF CONTEST IN ITS HISTORY LAST FALL, POWELSON WAS ON HAND TO TAKE PART IN THE PRE-GAME COIN FLIP. HE WAS ALREADY INTO HIS FIGHT AGAINST PROSTATE CANCER AT THE TIME, BUT POWELSON RARELY MISSED A SPORTING EVENT AT EITHER NORTH CARROLL OR MANCHESTER VALLEY. HIS DAUGHTER, DENEAN KOONTZ, IS NORTH CARROLL'S FIELD HOCKEY COACH. HIS SON-IN-LAW, BERNIE KOONTZ, COACHES BASKETBALL AT MANCHESTER VALLEY. DENEAN KOONTZ SAID IT SERVED HER FATHER WELL DURING A DIFFICULT TIME BEING ABLE TO WATCH THE PANTHERS' FIELD HOCKEY TEAM WIN THE LAST TWO CLASS 1A STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS, WITH HIS GRANDDAUGHTER JENSYN KOONTZ AS A STANDOUT. "HE DOESN'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY," DENEAN KOONTZ SAID. "HE KEPT FIGHTING UNTIL THE DAY HE PASSED AWAY. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO MY FATHER ... WAS HIS FAMILY. FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THE PAST [FEW] YEARS WITH THEM, AND TO SEE ALL OF THOSE THINGS, WAS VERY, VERY SPECIAL." PAT.STOETZER@CARROLLCOUNTYTIMES.COM 410-857-7894 TWITTER.COM/CARROLLVARSITY FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS VISITATION FOR ED POWELSON IS SCHEDULED FOR 2-5 AND 7-9 P.M. WEDNESDAY AT ELINE FUNERAL HOME, 934 S.

16	AND IT WASNT LONG AGO THAT I WAS ASKING BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WERE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF GRIEF THAN I WAS THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. IM NOT SURE WHEN I STOPPED ASKING IT PROBABLY WHEN I REALIZED IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN. STRADDLING HEAVEN AND EARTH ISNT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE ASEASY. EASIERIS A TRICKY WORD WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING AS PERMANENTLY HORRIFIC AS CHILD LOSS. I LIKE TO RESERVE THE WORDEASIERFOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING A NEW SKILL OVER TIME. EASIER IS A NICE LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEMEASURED.ITS ALSO A LOVELY LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT ARENT IRRETRIEVABLY LOST AND PERMANENTLY MISSING. FOREVER AND EVER. IM CERTAIN THE PROGRESS OF MOVING THROUGH THE UNCHARTED WATERS OF GRIEF AFTER THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS IMMEASURABLE. ITS ONE STEP FORWARD, FOUR STEPS BACK. ITS TREADING WATER, WITH YOUR HEAD SLIGHTLY ABOVE, UNTIL YOURE NOT. ITS ALONG, THEN DROWNING WITHOUT NOTICE. ITS NOT LINEAR. I WILL REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT GRIEF. WHETHER IN A DAY, A YEAR, OR A LIFETIME GRIEF ISNOTLINEAR. EVEN STILL, SEVEN YEARS LATER, I THINK IM SAILING ALONGOK,THEN ALL OF A SUDDENSMACKOUT OF NOWHERE GRIEF BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. SOMETIMES IT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF A STRATEGICALLY PLACED NINE YEAR OLD, BLUE-EYED LITTLE BOY WHO SHOULD BE MY LIVING BREATHING OLDEST SON, BUT WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER MOTHER WHO IS CALLING AFTER HIM; SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM THE MISSING PUZZLE PIECE OF MY HEART THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF MY SON THAT STARTS OOZING UNCONTROLLABLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND TEARS LEAK OUT OF MY EYES WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. SOMETIMES ITS THE SIMPLE, ALMOST-PERFECT MOMENTS WITH MY 2/3RDS CHILDREN, THAT SMACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD AND ROB MY LUNGS OF PROPER BREATH. BREATHE,I GASP.BREATHE. THE THING ABOUT LIFE AFTER LOSS IS THAT NO MATTER WHATSOMEONE IS ALWAYS MISSING.NO MATTER WHAT, MY FAMILY IS ALWAYS ACHINGLYINCOMPLETE.I COULD HAVE FOUR MORE CHILDREN, AND THESE FACTS WOULD STILL REMAIN, STARING ME DOWN LIKE A CRUEL BULLY WHO WILL TORMENT ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT BACK. THE REALITY OF CHILD LOSS IS THAT THE WRONG CAN NEVER BE MADE RIGHT. IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED. EVER. LIFE IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN WITHOUT OUR LIVING, BREATHING CHILD(REN) IN IT. LIFE WILL NEVER FEEL A-OKAY AGAIN. SURE IT WILL HAVE MOMENTS OF BITTERSWEET JOY, AND BITTERSWEET HAPPINESS, AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LAUGH AGAIN, AND FIND STUPID THINGS FUNNY, BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE WHAT ITONCE WAS. THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THAT TWITTERPATED FEELING OF HAPPINESS THE KIND THAT FEELS NAIVE NOW, THE YOU WONDER IF EVER EXISTED AT ALL? YOU MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. YOU CANT FIX IT, MEND IT, OR EVEN CRY IT AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS GO BY,THE ACHE REMAINS. SO BACK TOTHEQUESTION DOES IT EVER GET EASIER? THE HARD TRUTH IS A RESOUNDINGNO.  HERE'S A GUITAR WITH A SHEDUA BACK: (FROM:HTTP://WWW.GUITARBENCH.COM/2012/01/04/SHEDUA-TONEWOOD-PROFILE/) AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS A MORE BROWNISH CAST THAN BUBINGA, BUT SHARES THE BLACK STREAKS. NOT FOR ME, ANYWAY. IT HASNT GOTTENEASIERTO LIVE WITHOUT A HUGE PIECE OF MY HEART. GRIEF IS ALWAYS THERE, LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WALK THIS EARTH WITHOUT MY SON. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO BREATHE WHILE CHOKING ON AIR. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE NORMAL ANSWERS TO NORMAL QUESTIONS ANYMORE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS LIVING IN THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OF GRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN HARD. WHETHER YOURE A DAY IN, OR 20 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO HARD. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD, OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION. SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD. AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE CAN HONOR OUR PRECIOUS CHILD WITH EVERY BREATH WE TAKE. WE CAN AND WILL BE HAPPY AGAINANDIM GUESSING IT WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS FEEL DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT OUR CHILD. WE LIVEANDWE GRIEVE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER, IT JUST BECOMESDIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT CALL THAT PESSIMISM, BUT FOR ME, ITSTRUTH. ITS SIMPLY THE REALITY OF BEREAVED PARENTHOOD. NOTE: GRIEF IS AS UNIQUE AS EACH PERSONS FINGERPRINT. IVE MET PLENTY OF BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WOULD SAY A RESOUNDING YES, GRIEF DOES GET EASIER OVER TIME. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR THEM. EASIER JUST ISNT THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. EACH PERSONS EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT. NO TWO PEOPLE GRIEVE THE SAME. AND OUR JOB IS TO MEET EVERYONES EXPERIENCE/REALITY WITH UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT AND LOVE.  SHE IS THE AUTHOR OFYOU ARE THE MOTHER OF ALL MOTHERS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE FOR THE GRIEVING HEART, FOUNDER OF THE AWARD-WINNING ONLINE COMMUNITYA BED FOR MY HEART. MY OWN NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING BLOG POST/ARTICLE: "EASIER" IS THE WORD SHE IS CONTEMPLATING HERE. DOES LOSING A CHILD OR A MUCH WANTED PREGNANCY GET EASIER? I AGREE WITH "NO". IT GETS BEARABLE. THAT IS THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE ALMOST YEARS OUT. THE DEFINITION OF BEARABLE IS: ABLE TO BE ENDURED, TOLERABLE. IT DIDN'T USED TO FEEL BEARABLE. I WOULD SAY THE GRIEF BECAME BEARABLE SOMETIME BETWEEN YEAR 1 AND 2. THAT IT WAS ALL ACTIVE GRIEF. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS I WAS UTTERLY LOST AND CONSUMED BY THE LOSS OF MICHAEL AND ALENA - HAPPINESS FELT PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE. AT 3-6 MONTHS I WAS GETTING INTO THE TERRITORY OF WANTING HAPPINESS AGAIN; OF WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HEAVIEST KIND OF GRIEF WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND I BEGAN FEELING THE NEED TO PARENT MY LOST BABIES THROUGH ACTS. FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR, I WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO HEAL AND FIND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF MY GRIEF AT THIS STAGE WAS CONSUMING, BUT NOT ALL-CONSUMING. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS A "NORMAL" PERSON AT ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME. AT THIS POINT IN MY JOURNEY AS A BEREAVED MOTHER, I WOULD SAY MOST WOULD CONSIDER ME A NORMAL, HAPPY, FUNCTIONING MOTHER/WIFE/WOMAN ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. MEANING, I GET ON WITH LIFE, TRYING TO ENJOY EVERYTHING I CAN, WHILE HONORING MY BABIES AND GIVING IN TO THE GRIEF WHEN NECESSARY. THINGS ARE BEARABLE. I'LL NEVER BE AT 100% AGAIN - THERE IS TOO MUCH SCARRING. BUT I WORK EVERY DAY TO GET JUST ONE MORE PERCENT HEALED. MY SKIN IS THICKER AND FOR 11 MONTHS OF THE 12 PER YEAR, I AM SMILING AND ABLE TO GET ON WITH IT. THAT SINGLE MONTH IS VERY NEAR. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BODY...THE NEARING OF OCTOBER. I CAN FEEL THEIR BIRTHDAY APPROACHING; CAN ALMOST HEAR IT, TOUCH IT, SMELL IT. THE LEAVES BEGINNING TO TURN AND THE COOL MORNINGS ARE INDICATORS THAT THE MONTH OF MEMORIES SWIMS NEARER TO ME. I WELCOME THE MEMORIES OF THE TWO BEINGS I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING UP TILL THAT POINT, BUT ALSO SHRINK BACK IN PAIN. THIS WILL BE THE MONTH (ALSO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS), THAT I HAVE TO RELIVE MY KIDS DYING. IT'S THE MONTH I HAVE TO REMEMBER GIVING BIRTH, WHILE TEARS OF HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FALL DOWN MY FACE. IT'S FREAKING PAINFUL. BUT, IT'S BEARABLE. AND I WILL GET THROUGH IT JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, KEEP READING. I LOVED THE WAY THIS WRITER EXPRESSED LIFE AS A BEREAVED PARENT. *COPIED FROM STILL STANDING MAGAZINE* A QUESTION IM FREQUENTLY ASKED BY BEREAVED PARENTS IS, DOES ITEVERGET EASIER? THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES IS PALPABLE. I KNOW. I GET IT. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION STILL SCARES ME TOO BECAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EASIER FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT.

18	NORFOLK CONSTABULARYS SAFER SCHOOLS PARTNERSHIP IS ROLLING OUT THE ANTI-VIOLENCE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM TO YEAR 9 STUDENTS IN ALMOST 50 SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTY BETWEEN NOW AND MARCH NEXT YEAR. THE PROGRAM, WHICH IS AIMED AT PUPILS AGED 13 AND 14, WAS STARTED AND IS PRESENTED BY ANN BARTLETT, THE MOTHER OF A SERVICEMAN WHO DIED AFTER A FIGHT IN A PORTSMOUTH PUB WHEN HE WAS KILLED BY ONE PUNCH. SHE SAID: ONE PUNCH CAN KILL WAS SET UP IN THE UK AFTER THE LOSS OF ONE OF MY OWN. 21 YEAR-OLD KYLE WAS INVOLVED IN A FIGHT WHILST ON A NIGHT OUT WITH FRIENDS. HE SUFFERED SEVERE HEAD INJURIES AND DIED LESS THAN 24 HOURS LATER. EVERY MONTH WE DISCOVER THAT THIS IS HAPPENING MORE AND MORE AND BY RAISING AWARENESS AND EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE EARLIER, WE MAY HELP TO LESSEN THESE TRAGIC SENSELESS DEATHS. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENTATION WILL BE TO ALERT YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE DANGERS OF FIGHTING AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES, THEREBY REDUCING VIOLENT CRIME IN SCHOOLS OR INVOLVING YOUNG PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL. INSPECTOR BEX BROWN, FROM THE SAFER SCHOOLS AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT TEAM, SAID: I AM THRILLED THAT THIS PRESENTATION HAS BEEN POSITIVELY TAKEN UP BY THE SCHOOLS IN NORFOLK. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF GETTING INTO FIGHTS. THE AIM OF THE PRESENTATION IS TO TRY AND PREVENT TRAGIC ACCIDENTS FROM HAPPENING IN THE PLAYGROUND AND TO SHOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF USING VIOLENCE RATHER THAN SPEAKING TO A RESPONSIBLE ADULT OR TEACHER TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. WE WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO RESPECT ONE ANOTHER AND IF A PROBLEM DOES ARISE, FOR THEM TO FEEL CONFIDENT TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND WALK AWAY. IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR DAVID WILLIAMS, 27, OF CROSSWAY TERRACE, ACLE, WAS JAILED FOR 27 MONTHS FOLLOWING A ONE PUNCH ATTACK IN NORWICH WHICH LEFT THE VICTIM HAVING TO BE PUT INTO AN INDUCED COMA BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE HEAD INJURIES HE RECEIVED. JACK CHEUNG HAD BEEN ENJOYING A NIGHT OUT IN THE CITY WITH FRIENDS AND WAS IN UPPER KING STREET, OUTSIDE ALL BAR ONE, WHEN HE WAS PUNCHED IN THE FACE IN AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK. MR CHEUNG SUFFERED A SERIOUS HEAD INJURY AFTER FALLING TO THE GROUND AND HITTING HIS HEAD ON THE PAVEMENT FOLLOWING THE ATTACK WHICH HAPPENED ON JULY 20 LAST YEAR. HE WAS TREATED BY PARAMEDICS AT THE SCENE AND WAS TAKEN TO THE NORFOLK AND NORWICH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL BEFORE BEING TRANSFERRED TO ADDENBROOKES HOSPITAL IN CAMBRIDGE, WHERE HE WAS PUT IN AN INDUCED COMA TO ALLOW HIS INJURIES TO BE TREATED. WILLIAMS WAS JAILED AFTER ADMITTING INFLICTING GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM. DO YOU HAVE A CRIME STORY? EMAIL PETER.WALSH @ARCHANT.CO.UK

20	CATERHAM PHOTOGRAPHER 'CHASING THE PERFECT PICTURE' TALKS ABOUT HER CAREER CAPTURING ARTISTS ON TOUR 16:48, 22 SEP 2015 UPDATED 16:49, 22 SEP 2015 BY AMANIHUGHES, CHRISTIE GOODWIN HAS BEEN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS SINCE THE AGE OF 12 AND HAS BUILT UP AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY CAPTURING TOP RECORDING ARTISTS ON TOUR VIEW GALLERY FROM THE LIKES OF KATY PERRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND ONE DIRECTION, THIS PHOTOGRAPHER FROM CATERHAM HAS CAPTURED A HEAP OF FAMOUS NAMES AND IS CONTINUING HER SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT PICTURE. CHRISTIE GOODWIN, A BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHER, WHOSE CAREER SPANS MORE THAN 35 YEARS, STARTED TAKING PICTURES AT THE AGE OF 12 AND WAS BOUGHT HER FIRST CAMERA AT 13. SHE GRADUATED FROM THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS IN ANTWERP AND GOT HER FIRST JOB IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY, EVOLVING TOWARDS EDITORIAL AND WORKING FOR NEWS AGENCIES BEFORE ENDING UP IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND TAKING PICTURES OF ARTISTS ON TOUR. CHRISTIE'S PORTFOLIO IS A WHO'S WHO OF TOP NAMES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, INCLUDING KATY PERRY, ED SHEERAN, USHER, TAYLOR SWIFT, ONE DIRECTION, SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY AND KYLIE MINOGUE, AMONG MANY OTHERS. SHE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME ON TOUR CAPTURING IMAGES OF ARTISTS WHICH APPEAR ON CDS, DVDS, TOUR MERCHANDISE, POSTERS, INTERNATIONAL PUBLICATIONS, BOOKS AND EXHIBITIONS. EVEN THOUGH CHRISTIE HAS BEEN ON TOUR WITH MANY ARTISTS SHE ADMITTED SHE IS STILL ON THE HUNT FOR THE ELUSIVE PERFECT PICTURE. THE THING I HAVE BEEN CHASING IS THE PERFECT PICTURE, IT KEEPS ME GOING, TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT, CHRISTIE SAID. PHOTOGRAPHY IS BASICALLY ONE MOMENT IN TIME AND YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL TO OTHERS, THAT'S WHY YOU CAPTURE IT, TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE WHAT YOU FELT AND WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED. I WANT TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT IN TIME, IF I SHOOT A SHOW I WANT THE VIEWER TO FEEL LIKE THEY WERE THERE, THAT WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT A PICTURE THEY FEEL THE MUSIC AND FEEL THE CROWD. THAT'S WHAT I AIM FOR IN MY PHOTOGRAPHY. @CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE EXPLAINED OUT OF ALL THE TOURS SHE HAS CAPTURED, KATY PERRY'S PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR WAS THE MOST EXCITING. I STARTED DOING THE REHEARSALS SO I ACTUALLY SAW THE SHOW BUILD UP TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE END, I SPEND TWO TO THREE WEEKS ON THE SHOW. IT WAS REALLY EXCITING TO SEE HOW SOMETHING COMES TO LIFE. THROUGHOUT HER ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER CHRISTIE HAS CAPTURED SOME POWERFUL IMAGES, FROM BB KING AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL TO SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY STRUMMING A GUITAR. HOWEVER SHE EXPLAINED HER FAVOURITE MOMENT TAKEN SO FAR WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF KATY PERRY DURING HER PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR. AN IMAGE WHICH IS NOW ICONIC AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD TO PUBLICISE THE TOUR. IN THE SHOW IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE FIREWORKS WERE BEHIND HER, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN, CHRISTIE SAID. THE MOMENT THE FIREWORKS GO, YOU GET TO SHOOT THREE FRAMES, SHE DIDN'T HAVE HER HEAD AROUND, THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE FIREWORKS. THAT FRAME HAS MADE HISTORY AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD, IT WAS A LUCKY SHOT AND I WAS HAPPY THAT WE GOT IT. ALWAYS ON THE MOVE EVEN THOUGH PHOTOGRAPHING FAMOUS ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS SOUNDS EXCITING AND CONSTANTLY DIFFERENT, CHRISTIE ASSURED IT WAS NOT ALWAYS GLAMOROUS, AS YOU ARE ALWAYS ON THE MOVE AND NEVER IN ONE PLACE FOR VERY LONG. WHEN YOU DO NOT TRAVEL, IT'S VERY EXCITING BUT WHEN YOU TRAVEL ALL THE TIME, LITTLE THINGS START TO BOTHER YOU, YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR LAUNDRY AND YOU ARE NOT IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG TIME, IT'S A DRAG. HOWEVER IN CONTRAST TO THIS CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE EASILY GETS BORED AND ITCHY FEET WHEN SHE COMES HOME TO CATERHAM AND IS EAGER TO GET OFF TO HER NEXT DESTINATION AND NEXT TOUR. THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS I DO ENJOY, YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES, SLEEP IN YOUR OWN BED, BUT AFTER THREE DAYS I WANT TO GO AGAIN, I GET BORED. WHEN I AM ON THE ROAD, I WANT TO BE BACK AT HOME AND WHEN I'M HOME I WANT TO BE ON THE ROAD. I CANNOT LIVE AT HOME, I WOULD GET BORED, BUT YOU ALSO CANNOT BE ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME, I NEED A COMBINATION OF THE TWO. WHEN ASKED IF SHE COULD IMAGINE HER LIFE TAKING A DIFFERENT PATH, CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED DOING ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN PHOTOGRAPHY. I COULD NOT BE ANYTHING ELSE, WHEN I PICK UP A CAMERA, IT'S JUST ME AND THE CAMERA, IT'S PART OF ME, IT'S WHO I AM, I CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT THE CAMERA. TAKE PHOTOS LIKE A PRO CHRISTIE HAS TEAMED UP WITH CURRYS PC WORLD TO HELP MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR CAMERA EQUIPMENT AND PROVIDES HER TOP TIPS ON HOW TO CAPTURE PHOTOGRAPHS AT FESTIVALS, FROM TAKING THE PERFECT FESTIVAL SELFIE, LOOKING TO NAVIGATE OBSTRUCTIVE CROWDS OR CAPTURING FAST-MOVING STAGE ACTION. PLAN AHEAD: LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE, KNOW WHICH ARTISTS YOU WANT TO SHOOT, AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT IF YOU WISH TO PHOTOGRAPH BANDS ON DIFFERENT STAGES, YOU NEED TO GET THERE IN TIME. ALSO PREPARE FOR THE FACT THAT THEY MIGHT NOT START EXACTLY WHEN THEYRE SUPPOSED TO. I ALWAYS CARRY MY OWN FESTIVAL SCHEDULE ON MY PHONE. SHOOTING MY FIRST BIG FESTIVAL EARLY ON IN MY CAREER, I NEARLY MISSED AC/DC, BECAUSE I WASNT PREPARED! BE PREPARED: MAKE SURE YOU BRING ENOUGH MEMORY CARDS AND BATTERY POWER TO LAST ALL THE WAY. CHANCES ARE YOU WONT HAVE ANYWHERE TO CHARGE THEM FOR HOURS AND YOU DONT WANT TO RUN OUT JUST BEFORE YOUR FAVOURITE BAND IS ON. KEEP THEM IN A LITTLE POUCH WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES AND MAKE SURE ITS WATERPROOF, SO YOU DONT BECOME VICTIM TO FAILING CAMERA EQUIPMENT. COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS: FESTIVAL STAGES CAN BE QUITE MESSY AND CLUTTERY, SO TAKE THE TIME TO COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS. LOOK FOR ANGLES WHERE YOU CAN AVOID PEOPLE OR OBJECTS THAT WILL MAKE THE PHOTO LOOK A MESS. FESTIVAL STAGES CAN ALSO BE VERY HIGH, ESPECIALLY THE MAIN STAGE, SO IT CAN EVEN BE A CHALLENGE FOR US PROS IN THE PHOTO PIT IN FRONT OF THE STAGE. BUT MAKE SURE YOU WAIT FOR THOSE MOMENTS WHEN YOUR FAVOURITE SINGER IS RIGHT AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE THATS WHERE YOU GET YOUR BEST SHOTS. REMEMBER THE CROWD: SOME OF MY BEST SHOTS ARE NOT OF THE ARTISTS BUT OF PEOPLE IN THE CROWD. THE CROWD OFTEN MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE AND CAN BRING TO LIFE THAT FEELING YOU GET BEING AT A FESTIVAL. THE GO PRO HERO 4 OR EE 4GEE ACTION CAM ARE GREAT FOR THIS KIND OF SHOT DUE TO THEIR ULTRA-WIDE ANGLE LENSES FOR A UNIQUE CROWD VIEW. WHEN YOU DO THIS, TRY TO HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER OR EVEN LOWER, PLAY WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES. MAKE SURE TO ALSO TAKE AT LEAST ONE LONG WALK AROUND THE WHOLE FESTIVAL GROUND TO HELP YOU FIND THE PERFECT SUBJECTS. MIND THE RAIN: FESTIVALS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR EVER-CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS. PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEOPLE IN THE MUD ARE TOKEN FESTIVAL SHOTS. HAVING RAIN VISIBLE IN THE SHOT CAN ADD SOMETHING INTERESTING, SO DONT TAKE IT AS A BAD THING. I NEVER GO TO A FESTIVAL WITHOUT A PLASTIC BAG TO PROTECT MY GEAR, AND HAVING A WATERPROOF CASE OR AN ACTUAL WATERPROOF CAMERA LIKE THE FUJIFILM XP80 CAN HELP TO CATER FOR ANY WEATHER CHANGE. CONSIDER YOUR LENSES: CHANGING LENSES IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD CAN BE A NIGHTMARE. DUST, MUD, THE BOOTS OF A CROWDSURFER AND AN AIRBOURNE CUP OF BEER HAVE A WAY OF FINDING YOU THE TIME YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LENS. PRACTICE CHANGING THE LENS UNDER A PLASTIC BAG OR UNDER YOUR JACKET. BECOME A FESTIVAL SELFIE KING OR QUEEN: IF YOURE GOING TO TAKE A SELFIE, MAKE SURE THE SELFIE TELLS A STORY. YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE OF YOURSELF, OR YOU CAN TAKE A FEW EXTRA SECONDS AND FRAME THAT SELFIE A LITTLE BETTER, GET SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THE SHOT, OR SOMETHING ANNOYING OUT OF IT. TAKE YOUR TIME, LOOK AROUND, AND MAYBE HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER SO THAT YOU HAVE THE WHOLE FESTIVAL IN THE BACKGROUND. IF YOU TAKE A LOT OF SELFIES, THE COMPACT PANASONIC TZ57 HAS A SELFIE SCREEN AND WI-FI SO YOU CAN POST IT ON THE WEB IMMEDIATELY. THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT: WHEN YOU TAKE PHOTOS OF YOUR FRIENDS, OR WHEN YOU TAKE SELFIES, TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT. IF THE SUN IS BEHIND THE PERSON IN THE PHOTO, THEIR FACE WILL BE DARKER. ITS NOT A BAD IDEA TO USE A FLASH IF YOURE SHOOTING AGAINST THE LIGHT, EVEN ON A SUNNY DAY. OR DO THE OPPOSITE, SHOOT AGAINST THE LIGHT AND PLAY WITH DARK SILHOUETTES. YOU DONT NEED A PRO CAMERA TO GET AN AMAZING SHOT LIKE THAT. TAKE IN THE VIEW: IT CAN BE REALLY FUN TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT LENSES. A FISH-EYE OR WIDE-ANGLE LENS CAN REALLY HELP CAPTURE THE SCALE OF THE FESTIVAL. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE FUN. A FISH-EYE IS A PRIME LENS, MEANING THAT YOU CANT ZOOM IN OR OUT WITH IT. THEREFORE, ITS UP TO YOU TO ACT AS THE ZOOM FOR THE LENS. BE SURE TO CHANGE PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES AND LINES. GET DOWN LOW TO THE GROUND, EVEN IF IT MEANS LAYING ON YOUR STOMACH IN WHATS LEFT OF THE FESTIVAL GRASS. LEAN UP AGAINST A WALL AND USE THE DISTORTION OF THE LENS TO WRAP THE WALL AROUND THE FRAME. JUST HAVE FUN! BE AWARE THAT IF YOU FRAME A CLOSE UP OF A PERSON NEAR THE OUTER EDGES OF A WIDE ANGLE OR FISH-EYE SHOT, THEIR FACE CAN BE STRETCHED OUT. KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT: THIS ONE IS CRUCIAL. GETTING A NEW CAMERA WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT FEATURES IS TEMPTING, BUT MAKE SURE YOU LEARN HOW TO USE THEM. WALK THROUGH THE MANUAL GUIDE AND TEST IT ALL OUT. IT MIGHT SEEM A BIT TEDIOUS TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE STEPS BUT EVEN THE PRO PHOTOGRAPHER TAKES HIS TIME TO LEARN TO KNOW THEIR CAMERA. ONCE YOU KNOW ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF YOUR CAMERA AND HOW TO USE THEM THEN THERE IS NOTHING STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND THAT PERFECT SHOT. CHRISTIE ADDED TO TAKE MANY PHOTOS, AS IT IS THE VOLUME THAT MATTERS AND GET TO KNOW YOUR CAMERA. DO NOT SHOOT ON THE AUTOMATIC, PUT YOUR CAMERA ON MANUAL AND TEST IT OUT, YOU CANNOT LET THE CAMERA THINK FOR YOU, YOU HAVE TO THINK FOR THE CAMERA AND SHOOT WHAT YOU WANT.

21	ENGLEWOOD, COLO. (AP) STILL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS AND A RHYTHM ON OFFENSE, PEYTON MANNING AT LEAST FOUND HIS FUNNY BONE. THE BRONCOS PUZZLED PASSER MET THE MEDIA AT HIS LOCKER TUESDAY WITH A CAREFREE SMILE AND BOUNCED BACK FROM AN ICY POST-GAME PERFORMANCE THAT FOLLOWED THE BRONCOS 19-13 VICTORY OVER BALTIMORE, ONE THAT INCLUDED NONE OF THE USUAL OFFENSIVE FIREWORKS. HOUNDED FIRST BY THE BOO-BIRDS WHEN THE BRONCOS RAN JUST ONE RED ZONE PLAY AND THEN BY REPORTERS, MANNING WAS ACERBIC AFTER STRETCHING HIS STREAK TO 21 DRIVES, INCLUDING THE PRESEASON, WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN CELEBRATION. THIS TIME, HE DELIVERED A FEW FUNNY LINES AND DEFLECTED TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS STILL-EVOLVING OFFENSE OF BLENDED CONCEPTS WITH A TOUCH OF HUMOR. ASKED ABOUT LANDING ON THE INJURY REPORT WITH A SORE BACK COURTESY OF ALL THOSE HARD HITS FROM THE RAVENS, MANNING DECIDED TO DELIVER HIS OWN EVALUATION OF THOSE ASKING ALL THE QUESTIONS. THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY GROUP, BY ANY MEANS, MANNING CRACKED. THIS ONE SURELY HAS GOUT. BUNIONS, THAT ONE. CARPEL TUNNEL OVER HERE FROM ALL THE TEXTING OF HIS SOURCES. AND THE DRIVE-TIME RADIO HOST, HES GOT LARYNGITIS FROM RIPPING ME ALL WEEK PLUS THE RASH THAT HE HAS THATS UNIDENTIFIED. BUT I NEVER HEAR YOU GUYS COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, SO IM NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. IN MANY WAYS, YOU GUYS INSPIRE ME, MANNING DEAD-PANNED. BUT, NO, I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT I WAS ON IT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. BUT I THINK LIKE A LOT OF GUYS, IT WAS A PRETTY PHYSICAL GAME ON SUNDAY. AND JUST LIKE THAT, MANNING WENT FROM BEING THE THERMOMETER TO BEING THE THERMOSTAT, SETTING THE TONE FOR THE TEAM INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THE MOOD SURROUNDING IT. I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES AROUND HERE THAT WE DID ACTUALLY WIN THE GAME AND THAT WE ARE 1-0. THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE I CANT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE HAD WE LOST THE GAME, MANNING SAID. THE OFFENSE, WHICH INCLUDES FOUR NEW LINEMEN, DID DO SOME GOOD THINGS SUNDAY, LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER AN 11-MINUTE FOURTH-QUARTER DRIVE THAT LED TO BRANDON MCMANUSS FOURTH FIELD GOAL. IM SURE OFFENSIVELY I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF GUYS THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO PLAY BETTER. I FEEL LIKE THAT THURSDAY PROBABLY COULDNT COME SOON ENOUGH, MANNING SAID. THE BRONCOS PLAY AT KANSAS CITY (1-0), WHERE A VICTORY WOULD GIVE MANNING AND THE BRONCOS A RECORD 13TH CONSECUTIVE DIVISIONAL ROAD WIN. FIRST THINGS FIRST. FINDING THE END ZONE IS PRIORITY NO. 1 FOR A TEAM THAT JUST TWO YEARS AGO BECAME THE FIRST IN NFL HISTORY TO CRACK THE 600-POINT BARRIER WHEN MANNING THREW FOR A RECORD 55 TOUCHDOWNS. SOMETIMES THE BEST MEDICINE IS TO GET BACK OUT THERE AND PLAY AS SOON AS YOU CAN, MANNING SAID. AND, AS HE SHOWED TUESDAY, SOMETIMES LAUGHTERS THE BEST TONIC, TOO. NOTES: ILB BRANDON MARSHALL SAID ONE OF THE SCREWS IN HIS SURGICALLY REPAIRED RIGHT FOOT HAS BROKEN, BUT HELL TRY TO DEAL WITH THE DISCOMFORT UNTIL AFTER THE SEASON BECAUSE SURGERY TO REMOVE IT WOULD REQUIRE A TWO-MONTH RECOVERY.

COSBY WANTS AIG'S SUIT TOSSED OR DELAYED LAST WEEK, THE 78-YEAR-OLD ACTOR, WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY AT LEAST 40 WOMEN OF HAVING DRUGGED AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THEM OVER SEVERAL DECADES, ASKED A FEDERAL JUDGE IN SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, TO DISMISS OR PUT ON HOLD A LAWSUIT FILED BY HIS HOME INSURER, AIG. IN JUNE, AIG SUED COSBY IN CALIFORNIA AND MASSACHUSETTS OVER HOME INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO HIM IN THOSE STATES. THE INSURER MAINTAINS THE POLICIES IN QUESTION COVER PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, WHICH INCLUDE DEFAMATION, EXCEPT WHEN THOSE CLAIMS ARISE FROM "SEXUAL, PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ABUSE." DEFAMATION LAWSUITS HAVE ALREADY BEEN FILED AGAINST COSBY BY TAMARA GREEN, THERESE SERIGNESE AND LINDA TRAITZ IN MASSACHUSETTS, AND BY MODEL JANICE DICKINSON IN CALIFORNIA. THE WOMEN CLAIM THEY WERE DEFAMED BY THE DENIALS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY COSBY OR HIS REPRESENTATIVES. RISK OF 'SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE' SEEN COSBY'S COUNSEL MAINTAINS THE ACTOR WOULD FACE "SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE" IF HE WERE TO HAVE TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THE WOMEN'S LAWSUITS AND AIG'S POLICY ACTION SIMULTANEOUSLY. "FORCING MR. COSBY TO FIGHT A FOUR-FRONT BATTLE WOULD DEMONSTRATE AIG'S COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF MR. COSBY," HIS LAWYERS WROTE IN A COURT FILING. "NOT ONLY DOES AIG'S ACTION BOLSTER THE UNDERLYING PLAINTIFFS, WHO WILL PERCEIVE MR. COSBY AS UNDER ATTACK EVEN FROM HIS SUPPOSED BACKERS, BUT IT SPLITS MR. COSBY'S FOCUS AND DRAINS HIS RESOURCES." AN AIG SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT, WHEN ASKED BY REUTERS. THE INSURANCE COMPANY NAMED THE 4 WOMEN AS CODEFENDANTS IN ITS ACTION, STATING THAT IT WAS SEEKING RELIEF THAT COULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THEIR DEFAMATION SUITS. THOUGH FEW OF US TAKE NOTE OF IT, DEFAMATION AND LIABILITY RISK IS GROWING WITH THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, TO THE POINT WHERE SOME INSURERS ADVOCATE SPECIAL COVERAGE FOR BLOGGERS .

24	NINETEEN COMMONWEALTH BANK CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCEPTED COMPENSATION FROM A BANK SCHEME FOR VICTIMS OF BAD FINANCIAL ADVICE SINCE ITS LAUNCH LAST YEAR, NEW FIGURES SHOW. AN UPDATE ON THURSDAY SAID CBA'S OPEN ADVICE REVIEW, WHICH WAS CLOSED TO NEW APPLICANTS IN JULY, HAD PROMPTED 8835 CUSTOMERS TO REGISTER FOR A FREE FILE REVIEW INTO WHETHER THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION. HOWEVER, IN A SIGN OF THE PAINSTAKING REVIEW PROCESS, A MINORITY OF FILES HAVE BEEN ASSESSED SO FAR, AND THE NUMBER OF SETTLED CASES IS EVEN LOWER. THE REPORT, BY EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS PROMONTORY FINANCIAL GROUP, SAID THAT AT THE END OF AUGUST, 686 CASES HAD BEEN ASSESSED BY THE BANK. OF THIS GROUP, THE BANK HAD OFFERED COMPENSATION IN 53 CASES, OR 8 PER CENT OF ALL CASES ASSESSED. THE COMPENSATION SO FAR OFFERED BY THE BANK IS WORTH $950,252 IN TOTAL. AMONG THE 53 CUSTOMERS OFFERED A PAYOUT, 19 PEOPLE HAD ACCEPTED THE COMPENSATION, 11 HAD REJECTED THE OFFER AND 23 WERE STILL REVIEWING THE BANK'S PROPOSAL. THE BANK HAS PAID OUT $488,815 IN COMPENSATION UNDER THE SCHEME, UP FROM $79,702 AT THE END OF APRIL. CBA LAST YEAR OPENED UP THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM. IT ALLOWS ANY CUSTOMER OF COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL PLANNING AND FINANCIAL WISDOM BETWEEN 2003 AND 2012 TO HAVE THEIR FILES REVIEWED. IT FOLLOWED A DAMNING SENATE INQUIRY THAT FOUND THE BANK HAD UNDERPAID VICTIMS OF A SCANDAL, SOUGHT TO AVOID SCRUTINY, AND COVERED UP THE MISCONDUCT. "THE PROGRAM'S PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE CUSTOMERS WHO RECEIVED POOR ADVICE ARE PUT BACK IN THE POSITION THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY RECEIVED APPROPRIATE ADVICE, AND TO GIVE REASSURANCE TO OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT THE ADVICE THEY RECEIVED WAS APPROPRIATE," CBA SAID. IN APRIL, CBA CHIEF EXECUTIVE IAN NAREV SAID THE "PAINSTAKING" INVESTIGATION INTO PAST FILES WOULD TAKE UP TO MOST OF 2016. CBA SAID IT HAD INCREASED THE NUMBER OF STAFF WORKING ON THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM BY 100 SINCE MAY TO 613, ALLOWING IT TO SORT THROUGH MORE CUSTOMER FILES. WHILE IT CATALOGUED MORE THAN 900,000 CUSTOMER FILES IN THE FOUR MONTHS TO AUGUST, IT SAID THAT RETRIEVING FILES FOR FINANCIAL WISDOM CUSTOMERS WAS A "CHALLENGE" AND IT WAS STILL RELYING ON HARD COPY FILES IN SOME CASES. SEPARATELY FROM THIS COMPENSATION SCHEME, CBA HAD PAID OUT ABOUT $52 MILLION TO 1100 CUSTOMERS OF SPECIFIC ADVISERS WHO WERE IDENTIFIED FOR HAVING PROVIDED SHODDY ADVICE, MAINLY BETWEEN 2008 AND 2
25	IT'S BEEN A BUSY YEAR FOR GEORGE ZIMMER, THE MAN BEST KNOWN FOR LAUNCHING MEN'S WEARHOUSE IN 1973. EARLIER THIS YEAR, ZIMMERWHO WAS OUSTED AS THE CEO AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF MEN'S WEARHOUSE IN 2013LAUNCHED ZTAILORS , A SERVICE THAT DISPATCHES TAILORS TO YOUR HOME OR OFFICE ON DEMAND. TOMORROW, AT DREAMFORCE, HE'S LAUNCHING ANOTHER COMPANY, GENERATION TUX , THAT ALLOWS MEN TO ORDER SUITS AND TUXES ONLINE. GENERATION TUX CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE NETWORK OF TAILORS THROUGH ZTAILORS WHO WILL BE ON HAND TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS, IF NECESSARY. THERE ARE 17 DIFFERENT SUIT STYLES AVAILABLE AND THEY EACH COST A FLAT RATE OF $95 TO RENT. YOU CAN RENT AN ENTIRE OUTFIT, INCLUDING SHIRTS, SHOES, TIES, AND CUFF LINKS, FOR $150. WHILE THE GENERATION TUX WEBSITE JUST WENT LIVE LAST NIGHT, ZIMMER AND HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN TESTING THE SITE IN BETA WITH CUSTOMERS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. "IT WORKS, THANK GOD," HE SAYS. GENERATION TUX IS NOT THE FIRST ONLINE TUX RENTAL BUSINESS TO HIT THE MARKET. COMPANIES LIKE THE BLACK TUX , MENGUIN , AND SIMPLE TUX ALL HAVE SIMILAR BUSINESS MODELS AND PRICE THEIR TUXES SIMILARLY. ZIMMER TELLS FAST COMPANY THAT HE HAS A TWOFOLD APPROACH TO DIFFERENTIATING GENERATION TUX FROM HIS COMPETITORS. THE FIRST IS IN SCALE. ZIMMER HAS RAISED $50 MILLION ACROSS TWO FINANCINGS, WITH PRINCIPAL INVESTORS THAT INCLUDE DAVE DUFFIELD, LYRICAL PARTNERS, AND MERITAGE. ZIMMER SAYS THAT SALESFORCE VENTURES HAS ALSO BECOME A FULL PARTNER IN THE BUSINESS. THIS INFLUX OF CAPITAL HAS GONE TOWARD ESTABLISHING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING A DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN LOUISVILLE, KY., THAT HOUSES 30,000 SUITS AND A DRY-CLEANING FACILITY TO ENSURE A QUICK TURNAROUND. "WE'RE READY TO SHIP IN QUANTITY WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO PUT UP A SIGN THAT SAYS, 'WE'RE SORRY, WE'RE OUT OF THIS STYLE,'" ZIMMER SAYS. BUT ZIMMER IS ALSO HOPING TO SET GENERATION TUX APART BY INVESTING HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY. "THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF BUILDING THIS BUSINESS WAS DESIGNING AND CODING THE WEBSITE," HE SAYS. THE SITE COMES WITH A LOT OF BELLS AND WHISTLES, INCLUDING A VISUALIZER THAT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO PUT DIFFERENT MERCHANDISE ON A MANNEQUIN, AND A WEDDING MANAGEMENT TOOL TO ALLOW BRIDES AND GROOMS TO SEE WHERE EACH GROOMSMAN IS IN THE TUX RENTAL PROCESS. ONCE A CUSTOMER HAS INPUT THEIR MEASUREMENTS ONLINE, TAILORS AT THE WAREHOUSE WILL ADJUST EACH SUIT OR TUX BEFORE IT IS DELIVERED. FOR ADDITIONAL ALTERATIONS, ZTAILORS WILL BE DEPLOYED TO ENSURE A PERFECT FIT. LAUNCHING GENERATION TUX AT DREAMFORCE SEEMS LIKE AN UNUSUAL MOVE FOR A CLOTHING E-COMMERCE COMPANY. BUT ZIMMER EXPLAINS THAT THIS DECISION MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. "WE REALLY THINK OF OURSELVES AS MUCH AS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AS WE DO A TUXEDO RENTAL BUSINESS," ZIMMER SAYS. MARK BENIOFF, A FRIEND OF ZIMMER'S, HAS BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE COMPANY, BOTH BY INVESTING IN IT AS WELL AS BY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS. ZIMMER EXPLAINS THAT THE GENERATION TUX PLATFORM HAS BEEN OUTFITTED END TO END WITH SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGY. AT DREAMFORCE, THE COMPANY WILL BE USED AS A CASE STUDY ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH SALESFORCE TOOLS.
26	MY OWN NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING BLOG POST/ARTICLE: "EASIER" IS THE WORD SHE IS CONTEMPLATING HERE. DOES LOSING A CHILD OR A MUCH WANTED PREGNANCY GET EASIER? I AGREE WITH "NO". IT GETS BEARABLE. THAT IS THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE ALMOST 4 YEARS OUT. THE DEFINITION OF BEARABLE IS: ABLE TO BE ENDURED, TOLERABLE. IT DIDN'T USED TO FEEL BEARABLE. I WOULD SAY THE GRIEF BECAME BEARABLE SOMETIME BETWEEN YEAR 1 AND 2. BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALL ACTIVE GRIEF. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS I WAS UTTERLY LOST AND CONSUMED BY THE LOSS OF MICHAEL AND ALENA - HAPPINESS FELT PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE. AT 7-4 MONTHS I WAS GETTING INTO THE TERRITORY OF WANTING HAPPINESS AGAIN; OF WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HEAVIEST KIND OF GRIEF WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND I BEGAN FEELING THE NEED TO PARENT MY LOST BABIES THROUGH ACTS. FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR, I WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO HEAL AND FIND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY. GRIEF AT THIS STAGE WAS CONSUMING, BUT NOT ALL-CONSUMING. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS A "NORMAL" PERSON AT ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME. AT THIS POINT IN MY JOURNEY AS A BEREAVED MOTHER, I WOULD SAY MOST WOULD CONSIDER ME A NORMAL, HAPPY, FUNCTIONING MOTHER/WIFE/WOMAN ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. MEANING, I GET ON WITH LIFE, TRYING TO ENJOY EVERYTHING I CAN, WHILE HONORING MY BABIES AND GIVING IN TO THE GRIEF WHEN NECESSARY. THINGS ARE BEARABLE. I'LL NEVER BE AT 100% AGAIN - THERE IS TOO MUCH SCARRING. BUT I WORK EVERY DAY TO GET JUST ONE MORE PERCENT HEALED. MY SKIN IS THICKER AND FOR 11 MONTHS OF THE 12 PER YEAR, I AM SMILING AND ABLE TO GET ON WITH IT. THAT SINGLE MONTH IS VERY NEAR. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BODY...THE NEARING OF OCTOBER. I CAN FEEL THEIR BIRTHDAY APPROACHING; CAN ALMOST HEAR IT, TOUCH IT, SMELL T. THE LEAVES BEGINNING TO TURN AND THE COOL MORNINGS ARE INDICATORS THAT THE MONTH OF MEMORIES SWIMS NEARER TO ME. I WELCOME THE MEMORIES OF THE TWO BEINGS I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING UP TILL THAT POINT, BUT ALSO SHRINK BACK IN PAIN. THIS WILL BE THE MONTH (ALSO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS), THAT I HAVE TO RELIV MY KIDS DYING. IT'S THE MONTH I HAVE TO REMEMBER GIVING BIRTH, WHILE TEARS OF HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FALL DOWN MY FACE. IT'S FREAKING PAINFUL. BUT, IT'S BEARABLE. AND I WILL GET THROUGH IT JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, KEEP READING. I LOVED THE WAY THIS WRITER EXPRESSED LIFE AS A BEREAVED PARENT. *COPIED FROM STILL STANDING MAGAZINE* A QUESTION IM FREQUENTLY ASKED BY BEREAVED PARENTS IS, DOES ITEVERGET EASIER? THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES IS PALPABLE. I KNOW. I GET IT. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION STILL SCARES ME TOO BECAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EASIER FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT. AND IT WASNT LONG AGO THAT I WAS ASKING BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WERE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF GRIEF THAN I WAS THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. IM NOT SURE WHEN I STOPPED ASKING IT PROBABLY WHEN I REALIZED IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN. STRADDLING HEAVEN AND EARTH ISNT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE ASEASY. EASIERIS A TRICKY WORD WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING AS PERMANENTLY HORRIFIC AS CHILD LOSS. I LIKE TO RESERVE THE WORDEASIERFOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING A NEW SKILL OVER TIME. EASIER IS A NICE LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEMEASURED.ITS ALSO A LOVELY LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT ARENT IRRETRIEVABLY LOST AND PERMANENTLY MISSING. FOREVER AND EVER. IM CERTAIN THE PROGRESS OF MOVING THROUGH THE UNCHARTED WATERS OF GRIEF AFTER THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS IMMEASURABLE. ITS ONE STEP FORWARD, FOUR STEPS BACK.  ITS SWIMMING ALONG, THEN DROWNING WITHOUT NOTICE. ITS NOT LINEAR. I WILL REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT GRIEF. WHETHER IN A DAY, A YEAR, OR A LIFETIME GRIEF ISNOTLINEAR. EVEN STILL, SEVEN YEARS LATER, I THINK IM SAILING ALONGOK,THEN ALL OF A SUDDENSMACKOUT OF NOWHERE GRIEF BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. SOMETIMES IT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF A STRATEGICALLY PLACED GORGEOUS NINE YEAR OLD, BLUE-EYED LITTLE BOY WHO SHOULD BE MY LIVING BREATHING OLDEST SON, BUT WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER MOTHER WHO IS CALLING AFTER HIM; SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM THE MISSING PUZZLE PIECE OF MY HEART THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF MY SON THAT STARTS OOZING UNCONTROLLABLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND TEARS LEAK OUT OF MY EYES WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. SOMETIMES ITS THE SIMPLE, ALMOST-PERFECT MOMENTS WITH MY 2/3RDS CHILDREN, THAT SMACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD AND ROB MY LUNGS OF PROPER BREATH. BREATHE,I GASP.BREATHE. THE THING ABOUT LIFE AFTER LOSS IS THAT NO MATTER WHATSOMEONE IS ALWAYS MISSING.NO MATTER WHAT, MY FAMILY IS ALWAYS ACHINGLYINCOMPLETE.I COULD HAVE FOUR MORE CHILDREN, AND THESE FACTS WOULD STILL REMAIN, STARING ME DOWN LIKE A CRUEL BULLY WHO WILL TORMENT ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT BACK. THE REALITY OF CHILD LOSS IS THAT THE WRONG CAN NEVER BE MADE RIGHT. IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED. EVER. LIFE IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN WITHOUT OUR LIVING, BREATHING CHILD(REN) IN IT. LIFE WILL NEVER FEEL A-OKAY AGAIN. SURE IT WILL HAVE MOMENTS OF BITTERSWEET JOY, AND BITTERSWEET HAPPINESS, AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LAUGH AGAIN, AND FIND STUPID THINGS FUNNY, BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE WHAT ITONCE WAS. THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THAT TWITTERPATED FEELING OF HAPPINESS THE KIND THAT FEELS NAIVE NOW, THE KIND YOU WONDER IF EVER EXISTED AT ALL? YOU MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. YOU CANT FIX IT, MEND IT, OR EVEN CRY IT AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS GO BY,THE ACHE REMAINS. SO BACK TOTHEQUESTION DOES IT EVER GET EASIER? THE HARD TRUTH IS A RESOUNDINGNO. NOT FOR ME, ANYWAY. IT HASNT GOTTENEASIERTO LIVE WITHOUT A HUGE PIECE OF MY HEART. GRIEF IS ALWAYS THERE, LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WALK THIS EARTH WITHOUT MY SON. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO BREATHE WHILE CHOKING ON AIR. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE NORMAL ANSWERS TO NORMAL QUESTIONS ANYMORE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS LIVING IN THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, SOUND LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OF GRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATHOF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN HARD. WHETHER YOURE A DAY IN, OR 20 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO HARD. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD, OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION. SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD. AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE CAN HONOR OUR PRECIOUS CHILD WITH EVERY BREATH WE TAKE. WE CAN AND WILL BE HAPPY AGAINANDIM GUESSING IT WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS FEEL DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT OUR CHILD. WE LIVEANDWE GRIEVE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER, IT JUST BECOMESDIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT CALL THAT PESSIMISM, BUT FOR ME, ITSTRUTH.  SHE SAID THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE LACK OF A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT WAS FINDING PEOPLE WILLING TO SERVE ON THE BOARD. ITS SIMPLY THE REALITY OF BEREAVED PARENTHOOD. NOTE: GRIEF IS AS UNIQUE AS EACH PERSONS FINGERPRINT. IVE MET PLENTY OF BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WOULD SAY A RESOUNDING YES, GRIEF DOES GET EASIER OVER TIME. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR THEM. EASIER JUST ISNT THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. EACH PERSONS EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT. NO TWO PEOPLE GRIEVE THE SAME. AND OUR JOB IS TO MEET EVERYONES EXPERIENCE/REALITY WITH UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT AND LOVE.

27	BOSTON, MA SINCE 1963, KATHARINE DIXON DUKAKIS, BETTER KNOWN AS KITTY, FAITHFULLY STOOD BY THE SIDE OF HER HUSBAND, WHOM SHE HAD JUST MARRIED, WHO WAS JUST BEGINNING WHAT WAS TO BE A LONG AND ILLUSTRIOUS POLITICAL CAREER. HIS NAME, MICHAEL STANLEY DUKAKIS A MEMBER OF THE MASSACHUSETTS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM 1963 UNTIL 1971, GOVERNOR THE STATE FROM 1975 TO 1979 AND AGAIN FROM 1983 TO 1991, AND THE 1988 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE. ONLY THE SECOND GREEK-AMERICAN GOVERNOR IN U.S. HISTORY SPIRO AGNEW (MD) WAS THE FIRST DUKAKIS ARGUABLY HAS ECLIPSED AGNEW, WHO WAS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FROM 1969 TO 1973, AS THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE GREEK-AMERICAN POLITICIAN OF ALL TIME. THROUGHOUT MUCH OF DUKAKIS POLITICAL CAREER, KITTY SUFFERED SOMETIMES SILENTLY, SOMETIMES INEVITABLY IN THE PUBLIC EYE WITH BOUTS OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE. NOW THAT HER HUSBAND IS OUT OF OFFICE, SHE IS NOT ONLY OPEN ABOUT THOSE ABUSES WHICH BECAME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE DECADES AGO BUT ALSO ABOUT HER DEPRESSION AND THE REVOLUTIONARY MANNER THROUGH WHICH SHE TREATED IT. IN FACT, SHE AND THE FORMER GOVERNOR PUBLICLY CONVEY THE MAGNIFICENT BENEFITS OF ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY (ECT). ECT UNQUESTIONABLY SAVED HER LIFE, GOVERNOR DUKAKIS TOLD THE NATIONAL HERALD, REGARDING THE THERAPYS REMARKABLE EFFECTS ON HIS WIFES CONDITION. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH POLITICO, MASSACHUSETTS FORMER FIRST COUPLE DISCUSS THE SAGA THAT HAS LED TO THEIR SHARING A PROMISING EMERGENCE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. KITTY VOLUNTARILY CHECKED INTO MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL IN JUNE 2001 AS JANE DEE, POLITICO REPORTS, FOR TREATMENT FOR SEVERE DEPRESSION. THANKS TO ECT, SHE IMMEDIATELY FELT MUCH BETTER WELL ENOUGH, IN FACT, TO JOIN HER HUSBAND IN CELEBRATING THEIR 38 TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY THE VERY NEXT DAY. THERE WERE NEGATIVE STIGMAS ATTACHED TO ECT, PARTICULARLY MADE PREVALENT BY THE OSCAR-WINNING 1975 FILM ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST KITTY HERSELF TOLD POLITICO SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AS SHE ENTERED THE HOSPITAL FOR HER FIRST TREATMENT. BUT THE DUKAKISES SOON REALIZED THAT DESPITE PERCEPTION, ECT WAS WONDERFULLY SUCCESSFUL. ACCORDINGLY, KITTY DECIDED SHE NO LONGER WANTED TO BE ANONYMOUS. AS POLITICO DESCRIBES, THEY HAD A PLATFORM TO ADVOCATE A MEDICAL TREATMENT THAT, DESPITE ITS MASSIVE IMAGE PROBLEM, IS WIDELY CREDITED WITH SAVING LIVES AND SETTING PATIENTS ONCE CRIPPLED WITH DEPRESSION ON THE ROAD TO HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE FUTURES. IN THE PROCESS, THE DUKAKISES HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES TO BE THE UNEXPECTED CHAMPIONS OF ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL AND MISUNDERSTOOD BUT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PROCEDURES IN MODERN MEDICINE. IN FACT, KITTY IS THE ONE DRAWING THE BIGGEST CROWDS THESE DAYS, HER CELEBRITY POLITICIAN HUSBAND TELLS POLITICO. BY COMPARISON, I ONLY GET POLITE APPLAUSE ITS PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY. DIET PILLS THE ADDICTION FOR MRS. DUKAKIS STARTED IN THE 1950S, WHEN SHE BEGAN SNEAKING HER MOTHERS DIET PILLS A EUPHEMISM AT THE TIME FOR AMPHETAMINES, OR SPEED, POLITICO REPORTED. THE HABIT GREW AND IT WASNT UNTIL 1974 WHEN DUKAKIS LEARNED ABOUT IT AND ASKED HER TO STOP. SHE TRIED, BUT COULDNT SHAKE THE HABIT FOR GOOD. KITTY FINALLY ENTERED REHABILITATION AND KICKED THE HABIT EIGHT YEARS LATER. BUT ALCOHOL REPLACED THE DRUGS, POLITICO WROTE, WHICH EXPERTS SAY IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION TO USE BOTH AS SELF-MEDICATION. SHE WAS ABLE TO TEMPER HER USE OF ALCOHOL DURING DUKAKIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, BUT INTENSIFIED HER DRINKING AFTER THE ELECTION WAS OVER. ECT-EPTIONAL NOTHING SEEMED TO WORK, UNTIL ECT. AS POLITICO DESCRIBES, AN ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY TREATMENT IS SUPPOSED TO RESET THE BRAIN TO DISRUPT THE PATIENTS DEPRESSION KIND OF LIKE REBOOTING A COMPUTER. WITH THE PATIENT UNDER ANESTHESIA, A SMALL CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY IS USED TO SPARK A GRAND MAL SEIZURE. DR. CHARLES WELCH, ONE OF THE NATIONS TOP EXPERTS ON ECT AND KITTYS PSYCHIATRIST, EXPLAINS THAT THE RESULTING SEIZURE IS THE NEUROLOGICAL EQUIVALENT OF FLICKING ON AND OFF EVERY LIGHT BULB IN NEW YORK CITY THREE TIMES IN ONE SECONDA MASSIVE EVENT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO JOLT THE BRAIN BACK INTO ITS NORMAL STATE. ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF PATIENTS WHO DO A SERIES OF ECT WHICH COULD RANGE FROM SIX TO 12 TREATMENTS GIVEN OVER A SERIES OF WEEKS GO INTO REMISSION. IT HAS THE HIGHEST REMISSION RATE OF ANY OF THE TREATMENTS THAT EXIST FOR DEPRESSION, SAYS DR. SARAH LISANBY, THE CHAIR OF THE PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES DEPARTMENT AT THE DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. LIKE OTHER CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS, THAT REMISSION IS NOT OFTEN PERMANENT. PATIENTS TYPICALLY GO ON ANTI-DEPRESSANT MEDICATION AFTER TREATMENT AND HAVE FOLLOW UP ECT TREATMENTS WHEN SIGNS OF DEPRESSION RETURN. LISANBY AND OTHER PSYCHIATRISTS SAY THAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FACING ECT NOW IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT REMISSION MORE PERMANENT. KITTY HAS TRAVELED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SINGING THE PRAISES OF ECT AND NEXT YEAR PLANS TO APPEAR FOR THE SECOND TIME AT AN ECT CONFERENCE IN SCANDINAVIA, POLITICO REPORTS, WHERE THAT THERAPY IS MORE WIDELY ACCEPTED THAN IN THE UNITED STATES. I CANT IMAGINE WHAT LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE WITHOUT ECT, SHE TELLS POLITICO. IT REALLY SAVED MY LIFE. ECT IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY ACCEPTED TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION, AND, IN FACT, IS BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR SEVERE DEPRESSION THERE IS. IT IS RELATIVELY QUICK AND PAINLESS, DUKAKIS TOLD TNH. SOMETIMES JUST ONE SERIES OF FIVE OR SIX TREATMENTS TAKES CARE OF THE PROBLEM FOR THE LONG TERM. IN OTHER CASES LIKE KITTYS, SHE NOW HAS ECT MAINTENANCE ONE TREATMENT ONCE A MONTH, AND SHE TAKES NO MEDICATION, WHICH NEVER HELPED HER ANYWAY. SHE NOW CHAIRS AN ECT SUPPORT GROUP, THE GOVERNOR CONTINUED, SPEAKS AT GRAND ROUNDS AT HOSPITALS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND IS THE CO-AUTHOR OF THE BOOK, SHOCK: THE HEALING POWER OF ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY, WHICH IS WIDELY USED AND RECOMMENDED BY PSYCHIATRISTS TO THEIR PATIENTS. AWARENESS AS ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION APPROACHES, DUKAKIS, A FIRSTHAND VETERAN OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS, WOULD LIKE MENTAL HEALTH BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT. I CERTAINLY HOPE THE CANDIDATES FOR THE PRESIDENCY WILL BE TALKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE CAMPAIGN. IT IS NOT, AND SHOULD NOT, BE A POLITICAL ISSUE, DUKAKIS BELIEVES, YET ONE THAT ALL POLITICIANS SHOULD ADDRESS. THERE IS NOTHING PARTISAN ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS. NOW, WITH THE PASSAGE BY THE CONGRESS OF BOTH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MENTAL HEALTH PARITY, WHICH REQUIRES INSURERS TO COVER MENTAL HEALTH JUST THE WAY THEY COVER ALL OTHER KINDS OF HEALTH, WE COULD BE ON THE THRESHOLD OF A HUGE BREAKTHROUGH IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THIS COUNTRY. THE POST APPEARED FIRST ON THE NATIONAL HERALD .
28	BALLACHULISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL SECRETARY DAVE KITSON OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE'S RBS BRANCH. PICTURE: IAIN FERGUSON, THE WRITE IMAGE A LOCHABER COMMUNITY IS FIGHTING TO SAVE ITS LOCAL BANKING SERVICE AFTER LEARNING THAT ITS BRANCH IS TO CLOSE AND BE REPLACED WITH A MOBILE BANK. PEOPLE LIVING IN THE BALLACHULISH AREA WERE SHOCKED AND DISAPPOINTED TO DISCOVER THAT RBS WAS PLANNING TO CLOSE ITS BRANCH IN THE VILLAGE. THE MOVE FOLLOWS THE CLOSURE OF THE RBS BRANCH IN KINLOCHLEVEN IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, WHICH WAS ALSO OPPOSED BY LOCALS. BOTH CLOSURES HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO FALLING CUSTOMER NUMBERS DUE TO MORE PEOPLE USING ONLINE AND MOBILE BANKING. THE BANK SAID THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AT THE BALLACHULISH BRANCH HAD DROPPED BY 26 PER CENT SINCE 2011, WITH ONLY 19 CUSTOMERS USING THE BRANCH ON A REGULAR WEEKLY BASIS. A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE BANK SAID: WE HAVE TAKEN THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO CLOSE THE RBS BALLACHULISH BRANCH ON DECEMBER 7, 2015. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO ENSURE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE WAYS FOR PEOPLE IN THE AREA TO CONTINUE TO BANK WITH US. SHE ADDED THAT THEY WOULD BE INTRODUCING A MOBILE BRANCH SERVICE AND CUSTOMERS WOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS AT THE LOCAL POST OFFICE. THE SPOKESWOMAN ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE FORT WILLIAM BRANCH AND EIGHT FREE TO USE ATMS WERE WITHIN 15 MILES OF BALLACHULISH. BALLACHULISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL CHAIRMAN KEVIN SMITH SAID LOCALS WERE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE PROPOSED CLOSURE. AND HE HAS WRITTEN TO THE BANK POINTING OUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THE KINLOCHLEVEN COMMUNITY HAS EXPERIENCED SINCE ITS BRANCH CLOSED, INCLUDING DELAYS IN CREDIT AND DEBIT PAYMENTS AND THE RESULTING CHARGES. HE ADDED THAT THE FIGURES GIVEN FOR CUSTOMER USAGE AT THE BALLACHULISH BRANCH WERE SO LOW THAT THEY WERE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE. MR SMITH WROTE: YOU ARE SAYING THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH FOOTFALL IN THE BANK, BUT AT ANYTIME I AM IN THERE IS A QUEUE. AND HE HAS ASKED THE BANK TO RESPOND TO A SERIES OF QUESTIONS INCLUDING HOW MANY CUSTOMERS RBS HAS IN THE BALLACHULISH AREA INCLUDING THOSE IN KINLOCHLEVEN, DUROR AND NETHER LOCHABER. MR SMITH ALSO WANTS TO KNOW WHETHER THE MOBILE SERVICE WOULD CONTINUE THE CURRENT HOURS ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY MORNINGS, WHAT ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE MADE FOR QUEUING, ESPECIALLY IN BAD WEATHER, AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A PRIVATE ROOM FOR CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH TELLERS. FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES REGIONAL CHAIRWOMAN FOR THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS AMANDA FRAZER SAID: WHILE AROUND 75 PER CENT OF HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS MEMBERS DO NOW BANK ONLINE, BRANCHES REMAIN VITAL, WITH 64 PER CENT OF MEMBERS USING THEM FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY USE THEM FOR DEPOSITING CASH, BUT FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS AND CASH WITHDRAWALS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT.
29	ON AUG 31, WE ISSUED AN UPDATED RESEARCH REPORT ON PAINTS AND COATINGS MAKER VALSPAR ( VAL - ANALYST REPORT ). VALSPAR SAW HIGHER PROFITS IN THIRD-QUARTER FISCAL 2015 (ENDED JUL 31, 2015) ON THE BACK OF SOLID COMMERCIAL EXECUTION AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER SURPASSED THE ZACKS CONSENSUS ESTIMATE WHILE REVENUES LAGGED THE SAME. THE COMPANY RAISED THE LOWER END OF ITS EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2015. VALSPAR HAS A BROAD PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHARE GAINS IN BOTH ITS PAINTS AND COATINGS SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY SHOULD CONTINUE TO GAIN FROM NEW BUSINESS WINS, INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH INITIATIVES AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. WINNING NEW BUSINESSES REMAIN A COMPANY-WIDE FOCUS THAT WILL POSITION VALSPAR WELL FOR THE FUTURE. THE ACQUISITION OF PAINT MANUFACTURING ASSETS OF ACE HARDWARE HAS REINFORCED VALSPAR RETAIL FOOTHOLD IN THE U.S. MOREOVER, VALSPAR HAS STRENGTHENED ITS POSITION IN THE $6 BILLION EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MARKET WITH THE TAKEOVER OF ITALY-BASED INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MAKER INVER HOLDING S.R.L. THE PURCHASE OF QUEST SPECIALTY CHEMICALS PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESSES HAS ALSO STRENGTHENS VALSPAR'S FOOTHOLD IN THE ATTRACTIVE AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH MARKET. THE COMPANY IS LOOKING TO BOOST SALES WITH THE INTEGRATION OF QUEST CHEMICALS. THE ACQUISITION ADDED 6% TO PAINTS SEGMENTS SALES IN THE THIRD QUARTER. IN ADDITION, VALSPARS PAINT BUSINESS IS ALSO BENEFITING FROM CONTINUED ROLLOUT OF VALSPAR BRANDED PRODUCTS AT ACE HARDWARE. MOREOVER, VALSPAR RESERVE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR PAINTS ARE ALSO DRIVING SALES IN THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CHANNEL. VALSPAR IS AGGRESSIVELY INVESTING IN PROMOTING THIS PRODUCT. VALSPAR IS ALSO MANAGING ITS COST WELL AND MAINTAINING A COST STRUCTURE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CURRENT EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. IT ALSO REMAINS COMMITTED TO BOOST SHAREHOLDER RETURN LEVERAGING HEALTHY CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, VALSPAR FACES CURRENCY HEADWINDS, STEMMING FROM A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR. UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY SWINGS REDUCED ITS SALES BY 5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER. CURRENCY HEADWIND IS EXPECTED WEIGH ON ITS SALES FOR FISCAL 2015. THE COMPANY NOW SEES ITS REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2015 TO FALL IN THE MID SINGLE-DIGITS YEAR OVER YEAR VERSUS A LOW SINGLE-DIGITS DECLINE EXPECTED EARLIER. WE ALSO ACCOUNT FOR VOLATILITY IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS. VALSPAR HAS EXPERIENCED DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLIES OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT VARIOUS TIMES, IMPACTING ITS ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS. THE OVERALL DEMAND ENVIRONMENT ALSO REMAINS UNEVEN. VALSPAR CURRENTLY SPORTS A ZACKS RANK #3 (HOLD).

"AND TODAY THE VIEW IS GOING TO CELEBRATE NURSES!" "YOU LET US KNOW THAT YOU WERE OFFENDED BY SOME OF OUR COMMENTS AND, BELIEVE ME, WE WERE LISTENING," SHE CONTINUED. "WE APOLOGIZE FOR OUR REMARKS AND WE KNOW HOW VITALLY IMPORTANT NURSES ARE." THEN BEHAR INVITED OUT "THE DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS FROM NYU COLLEGE OF NURSING TO SHARE FIRSTHAND WHAT THESE HARDWORKING NURSES DO ON A DAILY BASIS." WATCH: 'THE VIEW' HOSTS APOLOGIZE OVER CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS MADE ABOUT NURSES WHILE THE HIGHLIGHTING OF THE HARD WORK NURSES DO IS CERTAINLY WELCOME, SOME ON TWITTER SUGGESTED THE SHOW'S EFFORTS WERE A LITTLE INSINCERE. ONE FAN WROTE , "COULD THE LOSS OF [JOHNSON&JOHNSON] HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?" THE BACKLASH STARTED WHEN THE CO-HOSTS WERE RECAPPING LAST SUNDAY'S MISS AMERICA PAGEANT, WHEN MISS COLORADO KELLEY JOHNSON OPTED TO GIVE A MONOLOGUE ABOUT BEING A NURSE FOR THE TALENT PORTION OF THE PROGRAM.

IN LIGHT OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE NURSING PROFESSION RECENTLY MADE ON DAYTIME TELEVISION WE WILL NO LONGER BE ADVERTISING ON THE SHOW IN QUESTION." "MY TALENT IS TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE, AND CARING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE," JOHNSON SAID ON THE ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW ON WEDNESDAY. "I THOUGHT, 'YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GO UP THERE AND I WANT TO BE AUTHENTIC. I WANT TO BE KELLEY.'" "AND IF IM EVER GOING TO WIN MISS AMERICA, I WANT TO DO IT BEING MYSELF," SHE ADDED. "AND IM A NURSE!" WATCH: WHOOPI SAYS ROSIE O'DONNELL WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO 'THE VIEW' ON WEDNESDAY, THE VIEW HOSTS APOLOGIZED FOR THE CONTROVERSY. CO-HOST MICHELLE COLLINS SAID, "WE LOVE NURSES. WE ADORE YOU. WE RESPECT YOU. YOU GUYS ARE WONDERFUL. YOURE THE MOST COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE. I WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT NURSES, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TALENT COMPETITION, AND IT GOT MISCONSTRUED." BEHAR ADDED THAT SHE WAS "JUST NOT PAYING ATTENTION," SAYING, "I WAS LOOKING AT A MISS AMERICA TAPE, AND THERES A WOMAN WEARING AN OUTFIT WITH A STETHOSCOPE, AND IM THINKING IS SHE IN A COSTUME?" "I DIDNT KNOW SHE WAS A NURSE," SHE SAID. "IM USED TO SEEING THEM IN GOWNS AND BATHING SUITS." WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE VIEW' S ATTEMPTS TO MAKE AMENDS WITH NURSES? YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE MOST POPULAR

32	IT'S BEEN A BUSY YEAR FOR GEORGE ZIMMER, THE MAN BEST KNOWN FOR LAUNCHING MEN'S WEARHOUSE IN 1973. EARLIER THIS YEAR, ZIMMERWHO WAS OUSTED AS THE CEO AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF MEN'S WEARHOUSE IN 2013LAUNCHED ZTAILORS , A SERVICE THAT DISPATCHES TAILORS TO YOUR HOME OR OFFICE ON DEMAND. TOMORROW, AT DREAMFORCE, HE'S LAUNCHING ANOTHER COMPANY, GENERATION TUX , THAT ALLOWS MEN TO ORDER SUITS AND TUXES ONLINE. GENERATION TUX CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE NETWORK OF TAILORS THROUGH ZTAILORS WHO WILL BE ON HAND TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS, IF NECESSARY. THERE ARE 17 DIFFERENT SUIT STYLES AVAILABLE AND THEY EACH COST A FLAT RATE OF $95 TO RENT. YOU CAN RENT AN ENTIRE OUTFIT, INCLUDING SHIRTS, SHOES, TIES, AND CUFF LINKS, FOR $150. WHILE THE GENERATION TUX WEBSITE JUST WENT LIVE LAST NIGHT, ZIMMER AND HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN TESTING THE SITE IN BETA WITH CUSTOMERS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. "IT WORKS, THANK GOD," HE SAYS. GENERATION TUX IS NOT THE FIRST ONLINE TUX RENTAL BUSINESS TO HIT THE MARKET. COMPANIES LIKE THE BLACK TUX , MENGUIN , AND SIMPLE TUX ALL HAVE SIMILAR BUSINESS MODELS AND PRICE THEIR TUXES SIMILARLY. ZIMMER TELLS FAST COMPANY THAT HE HAS A TWOFOLD APPROACH TO DIFFERENTIATING GENERATION TUX FROM HIS COMPETITORS. THE FIRST IS IN SCALE. ZIMMER HAS RAISED $50 MILLION ACROSS TWO FINANCINGS, WITH PRINCIPAL INVESTORS THAT INCLUDE DAVE DUFFIELD, LYRICAL PARTNERS, AND MERITAGE. ZIMMER SAYS THAT SALESFORCE VENTURES HAS ALSO BECOME A FULL PARTNER IN THE BUSINESS. THIS INFLUX OF CAPITAL HAS GONE TOWARD ESTABLISHING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING A DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN LOUISVILLE, KY., THAT HOUSES 30,000 SUITS AND A DRY-CLEANING FACILITY TO ENSURE A QUICK TURNAROUND. "WE'RE READY TO SHIP IN QUANTITY WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO PUT UP A SIGN THAT SAYS, 'WE'RE SORRY, WE'RE OUT OF THIS STYLE,'" ZIMMER SAYS. BUT ZIMMER IS ALSO HOPING TO SET GENERATION TUX APART BY INVESTING HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY. "THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF BUILDING THIS BUSINESS WAS DESIGNING AND CODING THE WEBSITE," HE SAYS. THE SITE COMES WITH A LOT OF BELLS AND WHISTLES, INCLUDING A VISUALIZER THAT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO PUT DIFFERENT MERCHANDISE ON A MANNEQUIN, AND A WEDDING MANAGEMENT TOOL TO ALLOW BRIDES AND GROOMS TO SEE WHERE EACH GROOMSMAN IS IN THE TUX RENTAL PROCESS. ONCE A CUSTOMER HAS INPUT THEIR MEASUREMENTS ONLINE, TAILORS AT THE WAREHOUSE WILL ADJUST EACH SUIT OR TUX BEFORE IT IS DELIVERED. FOR ADDITIONAL ALTERATIONS, ZTAILORS WILL BE DEPLOYED TO ENSURE A PERFECT FIT. LAUNCHING GENERATION TUX AT DREAMFORCE SEEMS LIKE AN UNUSUAL MOVE FOR A CLOTHING E-COMMERCE COMPANY. BUT ZIMMER EXPLAINS THAT THIS DECISION MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. "WE REALLY THINK OF OURSELVES AS MUCH AS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AS WE DO A TUXEDO RENTAL BUSINESS," ZIMMER SAYS. MARK BENIOFF, A FRIEND OF ZIMMER'S, HAS BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE COMPANY, BOTH BY INVESTING IN IT AS WELL AS BY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS. ZIMMER EXPLAINS THAT THE GENERATION TUX PLATFORM HAS BEEN OUTFITTED END TO END WITH SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGY. AT DREAMFORCE, THE COMPANY WILL BE USED AS A CASE STUDY ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH SALESFORCE TOOLS.
33	UPDATE ENGLEWOOD, COLO. (AP) STILL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS AND A RHYTHM ON OFFENSE, PEYTON MANNING AT LEAST FOUND HIS FUNNY BONE. THE BRONCOS PUZZLED PASSER MET THE MEDIA AT HIS LOCKER TUESDAY WITH A CAREFREE SMILE AND BOUNCED BACK FROM AN ICY POST-GAME PERFORMANCE THAT FOLLOWED THE BRONCOS 19-13 VICTORY OVER BALTIMORE, ONE THAT INCLUDED NONE OF THE USUAL OFFENSIVE FIREWORKS. HOUNDED FIRST BY THE BOO-BIRDS WHEN THE BRONCOS RAN JUST ONE RED ZONE PLAY AND THEN BY REPORTERS, MANNING WAS ACERBIC AFTER STRETCHING HIS STREAK TO 21 DRIVES, INCLUDING THE PRESEASON, WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN CELEBRATION. THIS TIME, HE DELIVERED A FEW FUNNY LINES AND DEFLECTED TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS STILL-EVOLVING OFFENSE OF BLENDED CONCEPTS WITH A TOUCH OF HUMOR.  THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY GROUP, BY ANY MEANS, MANNING CRACKED. THIS ONE SURELY HAS GOUT. BUNIONS, THAT ONE. CARPEL TUNNEL OVER HERE FROM ALL THE TEXTING OF HIS SOURCES. AND THE DRIVE-TIME RADIO HOST, HES GOT LARYNGITIS FROM RIPPING ME ALL WEEK PLUS THE RASH THAT HE HAS THATS UNIDENTIFIED. BUT I NEVER HEAR YOU GUYS COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, SO IM NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. IN MANY WAYS, YOU GUYS INSPIRE ME, MANNING DEAD-PANNED. BUT, NO, I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT I WAS ON IT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. BUT I THINK LIKE A LOT OF GUYS, IT WAS A PRETTY PHYSICAL GAME ON SUNDAY. AND JUST LIKE THAT, MANNING WENT FROM BEING THE THERMOMETER TO BEING THE THERMOSTAT, SETTING THE TONE FOR THE TEAM INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THE MOOD SURROUNDING IT. I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES AROUND HERE THAT WE DID ACTUALLY WIN THE GAME AND THAT WE ARE 1-0. THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE I CANT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE HAD WE LOST THE GAME, MANNING SAID. THE OFFENSE, WHICH INCLUDES FOUR NEW LINEMEN, DID DO SOME GOOD THINGS SUNDAY, LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER AN 11-MINUTE FOURTH-QUARTER DRIVE THAT LED TO BRANDON MCMANUSS FOURTH FIELD GOAL. IM SURE OFFENSIVELY I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF GUYS THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO PLAY BETTER. I FEEL LIKE THAT THURSDAY PROBABLY COULDNT COME SOON ENOUGH, MANNING SAID. THE BRONCOS PLAY AT KANSAS CITY (1-0), WHERE A VICTORY WOULD GIVE MANNING AND THE BRONCOS A RECORD 13TH CONSECUTIVE DIVISIONAL ROAD WIN. FIRST THINGS FIRST. FINDING THE END ZONE IS PRIORITY NO. 1 FOR A TEAM THAT JUST TWO YEARS AGO BECAME THE FIRST IN NFL HISTORY TO CRACK THE 600-POINT BARRIER WHEN MANNING THREW FOR A RECORD 55 TOUCHDOWNS.  AND, AS HE SHOWED TUESDAY, SOMETIMES LAUGHTERS THE BEST TONIC, TOO. NOTES: ILB BRANDON MARSHALL SAID ONE OF THE SCREWS IN HIS SURGICALLY REPAIRED RIGHT FOOT HAS BROKEN, BUT HELL TRY TO DEAL WITH THE DISCOMFORT UNTIL AFTER THE SEASON BECAUSE SURGERY TO REMOVE IT WOULD REQUIRE A TWO-MONTH RECOVERY. S DARIAN STEWART (GROIN) GOT HURT ON THE PLAY BEFORE HIS GAME-WINNING INTERCEPTION SUNDAY, SOMETHING COACH GARY KUBIAK DIDNT LEARN UNTIL WATCHING CB AQIB TALIB, WHO WAS MICD UP FOR THE GAME, ON THE TEAMS WEBSITE.

34	MY OWN NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING BLOG POST/ARTICLE: "EASIER" IS THE WORD SHE IS CONTEMPLATING HERE.  I AGREE WITH "NO". IT GETS BEARABLE. THAT IS THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE ALMOST 4 YEARS OUT. THE DEFINITION OF BEARABLE IS: ABLE TO BE ENDURED, TOLERABLE. IT DIDN'T USED TO FEEL BEARABLE. I WOULD SAY THE GRIEF BECAME BEARABLE SOMETIME BETWEEN YEAR 1 AND 2. BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALL ACTIVE GRIEF. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS I WAS UTTERLY LOST AND CONSUMED BY THE LOSS OF MICHAEL AND ALENA - HAPPINESS FELT PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE. AT 3-6 MONTHS I WAS GETTING INTO THE TERRITORY OF WANTING HAPPINESS AGAIN; OF WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HEAVIEST KIND OF GRIEF WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND I BEGAN FEELING THE NEED TO PARENT MY LOST BABIES THROUGH ACTS. FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR, I WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO HEAL AND FIND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY. GRIEF AT THIS STAGE WAS CONSUMING, BUT NOT ALL-CONSUMING. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS A "NORMAL" PERSON AT ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME. AT THIS POINT IN MY JOURNEY AS A BEREAVED MOTHER, I WOULD SAY MOST WOULD CONSIDER ME A NORMAL, HAPPY, FUNCTIONING MOTHER/WIFE/WOMAN ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. MEANING, I GET ON WITH LIFE, TRYING TO ENJOY EVERYTHING I CAN, WHILE HONORING MY BABIES AND GIVING IN TO THE GRIEF WHEN NECESSARY. THINGS ARE BEARABLE. I'LL NEVER BE AT 100% AGAIN - THERE IS TOO MUCH SCARRING. BUT I WORK EVERY DAY TO GET JUST ONE MORE PERCENT HEALED. MY SKIN IS THICKER AND FOR 11 MONTHS OF THE 12 PER YEAR, I AM SMILING AND ABLE TO GET ON WITH IT. THAT SINGLE MONTH IS VERY NEAR. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BODY...THE NEARING OF OCTOBER. I CAN FEEL THEIR BIRTHDAY APPROACHING; CAN ALMOST HEAR IT, TOUCH IT, SMELL IT. THE LEAVES BEGINNING TO TURN AND THE COOL MORNINGS ARE INDICATORS THAT THE MONTH OF MEMORIES SWIMS NEARER TO ME. I WELCOME THE MEMORIES OF THE TWO BEINGS I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING UP TILL THAT POINT, BUT ALSO SHRINK BACK IN PAIN. THIS WILL BE THE MONTH (ALSO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS), THAT I HAVE TO RELIVE MY KIDS DYING. IT'S THE MONTH I HAVE TO REMEMBER GIVING BIRTH, WHILE TEARS OF HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FALL DOWN MY FACE. IT'S FREAKING PAINFUL. BUT, IT'S BEARABLE. AND I WILL GET THROUGH IT JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, KEEP READING. I LOVED THE WAY THIS WRITER EXPRESSED LIFE AS A BEREAVED PARENT. *COPIED FROM STILL STANDING MAGAZINE* A QUESTION IM FREQUENTLY ASKED BY BEREAVED PARENTS IS, DOES ITEVERGET EASIER? THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES IS PALPABLE. I KNOW. I GET IT. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION STILL SCARES ME TOO BECAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EASIER FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT. AND IT WASNT LONG AGO THAT I WAS ASKING BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WERE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF GRIEF THAN I WAS THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. IM NOT SURE WHEN I STOPPED ASKING IT PROBABLY WHEN I REALIZED IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN. STRADDLING HEAVEN AND EARTH ISNT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE ASEASY. EASIERIS A TRICKY WORD WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING AS PERMANENTLY HORRIFIC AS CHILD LOSS. I LIKE TO RESERVE THE WORDEASIERFOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING A NEW SKILL OVER TIME. EASIER IS A NICE LITTLEWORD FOR THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEMEASURED.ITS ALSO A LOVELY LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT ARENT IRRETRIEVABLY LOST AND PERMANENTLY MISSING. FOREVER AND EVER. IM CERTAIN THE PROGRESS OF MOVING THROUGH THE UNCHARTED WATERS OF GRIEF AFTER THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS IMMEASURABLE. ITS ONE STEP FORWARD, FOUR STEPS BACK. ITS TREADING WATER, WITH YOUR HEAD SLIGHTLY ABOVE, UNTIL YOURE NOT. ITS SWIMMING ALONG, THEN DROWNING WITHOUT NOTICE. ITS NOT LINEAR. I WILL REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT GRIEF. WHETHER IN A DAY, A YEAR, OR A LIFETIME GRIEF ISNOTLINEAR. EVEN STILL, SEVEN YEARS LATER, I THINK IM SAILING ALONGOK,THEN ALL OF A SUDDENSMACKOUT OF NOWHERE GRIEF BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. SOMETIMES IT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF A STRATEGICALLY PLACED GORGEOUS NINE YEAR OLD, BLUE-EYED LITTLE BOY WHO SHOULD BE MY LIVING BREATHING OLDEST SON, BUT WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER MOTHER WHO IS CALLING AFTER HIM; SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM THE MISSING PUZZLE PIECE OF MY HEART THE SIZE AND SHPE OF MY SON THAT STARTS OOZING UNCONTROLLABLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND TEARS LEAK OUT OF MY EYES WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. SOMETIMES ITS THE SIMPLE, ALMOST-PERFECT MOMENTS WITH MY 2/3RDS CHILDREN, THAT SMACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD AND ROB MY LUNGS OF PROPER BREATH. BREATHE,I GASP.BREATHE. THE THING ABOUT LIFE AFTER LOSS IS THAT NO MATTER WHATSOMEONE IS ALWAYS MISSING.NO MATTER WHAT, MY FAMILY IS ALWAYS ACHINGLYINCOMPLETE.I COULD HAVE FOUR MORE CHILDREN, AND THESE FACTS WOULD STILL REMAIN, STARING ME DOWN LIKE A CRUEL BULLY WHO WILL TORMENT ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT BACK. THE REALITY OF CHILD LOSS IS THAT THE WRONG CAN NEVER BE MADE RIGHT. IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED. EVER. LIFE IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN WITHOUT OUR LIVING, BREATHING CHILD(REN) IN IT. LIFE WILL NEVER FEEL A-OKAY AGAIN. SURE IT WILL HAVE MOMENTS OF BITTERSWEET JOY, AND BITTERSWEET HAPPINESS, AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LAUGH AGAIN, AND FIND STUPID THINGS FUNNY, BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE WHAT ITONCE WAS. THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THAT TWITTERPATED FEELING OF HAPPINESS THE KIND THAT FEELS NAIVE NOW, THE KIND YOU WONDER IF EVER EXISTED AT ALL? YOU MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. YOU CANT FIX IT, MEND IT, OR EVEN CRY IT AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS GO BY,THE ACHE REMAINS. SO BACK TOTHEQUESTION DOES IT EVER GET EASIER? THE HARD TRUTH IS A RESOUNDINGNO. NOT FOR ME, ANYWAY. IT HASNT GOTTENEASIERTO LIVE WITHOUT A HUGE PIECE OF MY HEART. GRIEF IS ALWAYS THERE, LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WALK THIS EARTH WITHOUT MY SON. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO BREATHE WHILE CHOKING ON AIR. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE NORMAL ANSWERS TO NORMAL QUESTIONS ANYMORE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS LIVING IN THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, SOUND LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OFGRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN HARD. WHETHER YOURE A DAY IN, OR 20 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO HARD. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD, OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION. SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD. AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE CAN HONOR OUR PRECIOUS CHILD WITH EVERY BREATH WE TAKE. WE CAN AND WILL BE HAPPY AGAINANDIM GUESSING IT WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS FEEL DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT OUR CHILD. WE LIVEANDWE GRIEVE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER, IT JUST BECOMESDIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT CALL THAT PESSIMISM, BUT FOR ME, ITSTRUTH. ITS SIMPLY THE REALITY OF BEREAVED PARENTHOOD. NOTE: GRIEF IS AS UNIQUE AS EACH PERSONS FINGERPRINT. IVE MET PLENTY OF BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WOULD SAY A RESOUNDING YES, GRIEF DOES GET EASIER OVER TIME. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR THEM. EASIER JUST ISNT THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. EACH PERSONS EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT. NO TWO PEOPLE GRIEVE THE SAME. AND OUR JOB IS TO MEET EVERYONES EXPERIENCE/REALITY WITH UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT AND LOVE. ANGELA MILLER IS A WRITER, SPEAKER AND GRIEF ADVOCATE WHO PROVIDES SUPPORT AND SOLACE TO THOSE WHO ARE GRIEVING THE LOSS OF A CHILD.

37	REVISE -- A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE BANK SAID: WE HAVE TAKEN THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO CLOSE THE RBS BALLACHULISH BRANCH ON DECEMBER 7, 2015. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO ENSURE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE WAYS FOR PEOPLE IN THE AREA TO CONINUE TO BANK WITH US. SHE ADED THAT THEY WOULD BE INTRODUCING A MOBILE BRANCH SERVICE AND CUSTOMERS WOULD BE  ABLE TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS AT THE LOCAL POST OFFICE. THE SPOKESWOMAN ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE FORT WILLIAM BRANCH AND EIGHT FREE TO USE ATMS WERE WITHIN 15 MILES OF BALLACHULISH. BALLACHULISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL CHAIRMAN KEVIN SMITH SAID LOCALS WERE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUTTHE PROPOSED CLOSURE. AND HE HAS WRITTEN TO THE BANK POINTING OUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THE KINLOCHLEVEN COMMUNITY HAS EXPERIENCED SINCE ITS BRANCH CLOSED,  INCLUDING ELAYS IN CREDIT AND DEBIT PAYMENTS AND THE RESULTING CHARGES. HE ADDED THAT THE FIGURES GIVEN FOR CUSTOMER USAGE AT THE BALLACHULISH BRANCH WERE SO LOW THAT THEY WERE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE. MR SMITH WROTE: YOU ARE SAYING THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH FOOTFALL IN THE BANK, BUT AT ANYTIME I AM IN THERE IS A QUEUE. AND HE HAS ASKED THE BANK TO RESPOND TO A SERIES OF QUESTIONS INCLUDING HOW MANY CUSTOMERS RBS HAS IN THE BALLACHULISH AREA INCLUDING THOSE IN KINLOCHLEVEN, DUROR AND NETHER LOCHABER. MR SMITH ALSO WANTS TO KNOW WHETHER THE MOBILE SERVICE WOULD CONTINUE THE CURRENT HOURS ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY MORNINGS, WHAT ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE MADE FOR QUEUING, ESPECIALLY IN BAD WEATHER, AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A PRIVATE ROOM FOR CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH TELLERS. FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES REGIONAL CHAIRWOMAN FOR THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS AMANDA FRAZER SAID: WHILE AROUND 75 PER CENT OF HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS MEMBERS DO NOW BANK ONLINE, BRANCHES REMAIN VITAL, WITH 64 PER CENT OF MEMBERS USING THEM FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.  CBA SAID IT HAD INCREASED THE NUMBER OF STAFF WORKING ON THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM BY 100 SINCE MAY TO 613 ALLOWING IT TO SORT THROUGH MORE CUSTOMER FILES. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY USE THEM FOR DEPOSITING CASH, BUT FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS AND CASH WITHDRAWALS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. BALLACHULISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL SECRETARY KITSON OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE'S RBS BRANCH. PICTURE: IAIN FERGUSON, THE WRITE IMAGE A LOCHABER COMMUNITY IS FIGHTING TO SAVE ITS LOCAL BANKING SERVICE AFTER LEARNING THAT ITS BRANCH IS TO CLOSE AND BE REPLACED WITH A MOBILE BANK. PEOPLE LIVING IN THE BALLACHULISH AREA WERE SHOCKED AND DISAPPOINTED TO DISCOVER THAT RBS WAS PLANNING TO CLOSE ITS BRANCH IN THE VILLAGE. THE MOVE FOLLOWS THE CLOSURE OF THE RBS BRANCH IN KINLOCHLEVEN IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, WHICH WAS ALSO OPPOSED BY LOCALS. BOTH CLOSURES HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO FALLING CUSTOMER NUMBERS DUE TO MORE PEOPLE USING ONLINE AND MOBILE BANKING. THE BANK SAID THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AT THE BALLACHULISH BRANCH HAD DROPPED BY 26 PER CENT SINCE 2011, WITH ONLY 9 CUSTOMERS USING THE BRANCH ON A REGULAR WEEKLY BASIS.

40	ON AUG 31, WE ISSUED AN UPDATED RESEARCH REPORT ON PAINTS AND COATINGS MAKER VALSPAR ( VAL - ANALYST REPORT ). VALSPAR SAW HIGHER PROFITS IN THIRD-QUARTER FISCAL 2015 (ENDED JUL 31, 2015) ON THE BACK OF SOLID COMMERCIAL EXECUTION AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER SURPASSED THE ZACKS CONSENSUS ESTIMATE WHILE REVENUES LAGGED THE SAME. THE COMPANY RAISED THE LOWER END OF ITS EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2015. VALSPAR HAS A BROAD PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHARE GAINS IN BOTH ITS PAINTS AND COATINGS SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY SHOULD CONTINUE TO GAIN FROM NEW BUSINESS WINS, INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH INITIATIVES AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. WINNING NEW BUSINESSES REMAIN A COMPANY-WIDE FOCUS THAT WILL POSITION VALSPAR WELL FOR THE FUTURE. THE ACQUISITION OF PAINT MANUFACTURING ASSETS OF ACE HARDWARE HAS REINFORCED VALSPAR RETAIL FOOTHOLD IN THE U.S. MOREOVER, VALSPAR HAS STRENGTHENED ITS POSITION IN THE $6 BILLION EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MARKET WITH THE TAKEOVER OF ITALY-BASED INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MAKER INVER HOLDING S.R.L. THE PURCHASE OF QUEST SPECIALTY CHEMICALS PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESSES HAS ALSO STRENGTHENS VALSPAR'S FOOTHOLD IN THE ATTRACTIVE AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH MARKET. THE COMPANY IS LOOKING TO BOOST SALES WITH THE INTEGRATION OF QUEST CHEMICALS. THE ACQUISITION ADDED 6% TO PAINTS SEGMENTS SALES IN THE THIRD QUARTER. IN ADDITION, VALSPARS PAINT BUSINESS IS ALSO BENEFITING FROM CONTINUED ROLLOUT OF VALSPAR BRANDED PRODUCTS AT ACE HARDWARE. MOREOVER, VALSPAR RESERVE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR PAINTS ARE ALSO DRIVING SALES IN THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CHANNEL. VALSPAR IS AGGRESSIVELY INVESTING IN PROMOTING THIS PRODUCT. VALSPAR IS ALSO MANAGING ITS COST WELL AND MAINTAINING A COST STRUCTURE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CURRENT EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. IT ALSO REMAINS COMMITTED TO BOOST SHAREHOLDER RETURN LEVERAGING HEALTHY CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, VALSPAR FACES CURRENCY HEADWINDS, STEMMING FROM A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR. UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY SWINGS REDUCED ITS SALES BY 5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER. CURRENCY HEADWIND IS EXPECTED WEIGH ON ITS SALES FOR FISCAL 2015. THE COMPANY NOW SEES ITS REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2015 TO FALL IN THE MID SINGLE-DIGITS YEAR OVER YEAR VERSUS A LOW SINGLE-DIGITS DECLINE EXPECTED EARLIER. WE ALSO ACCOUNT FOR VOLATILITY IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS. VALSPAR HAS EXPERIENCED DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLIES OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT VARIOUS TIMES, IMPACTING ITS ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS. THE OVERALL DEMAND ENVIRONMENT ALSO REMAINS UNEVEN. VALSPAR CURRENTLY SPORTS A ZACKS RANK #3 (HOLD). OTHER STOCKS TO CONSIDER OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BASIC MATERIALS SPACE WORTH CONSIDERING INCLUDE INNOSPEC INC. ( IOSP - SNAPSHOT REPORT ), AIR PRODUCTS & CHEMICALS INC. ( APD - ANALYST REPORT ) AND LYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V. ( LYB - ANALYST REPORT ).

41	YOU MAY NOTICE A FEW THINGS LOOK DIFFERENT AROUND HERE . THATS BECAUSE WE HAVE REVAMPED ISSUUS COLOR PALETTE, AS PART OF A CONTINUING EFFORT TO UNIFY OUR BRAND PRESENTATION AND EXPERIENCE ACROSS PLATFORMS. WE CALL THIS OUR LIGHT THEME. IF YOU USE OUR AWARD-WINNING IOS APP (AND IF YOU HAVENT YET, YOURE IN FOR A TREAT), ISSUUS NEW COLOR PALETTE IS AN INVERSION OF THE DARK THEME FOUND IN THAT APP. THE SHIFT IN OUR DESIGN THINKING BEGAN LAST FALL WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE IOS APP, AND I WANTED TO SHARE WHAT WE LEARNED FROM A BRAND AND UX PERSPECTIVE. THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO ROLL OUT BRAND SHIFTS AND EXPERIENCE UPDATES. ONE APPROACH IS THE BIG BANG, WHERE ALL THE GUIDELINES GET RESPECIFIED; NEW ASSETS ARE CREATED; AND PRODUCTS ARE BUILT, TESTED AND LAUNCHED ON ALL THE PLATFORMS AT ONCE. BANG! THIS PROCESS CAN WORK FOR NEW COMPANIES THAT ARE ABLE TO DESIGN FROM SCRATCH, OR FOR LARGE ENTERPRISES THAT CAN DEDICATE TEAMS OVER THE COURSE OF MONTHS, AND SOMETIMES YEARS TO THE ENDEAVOR. THE SECOND WAY IS INCREMENTAL. THIS IS BEST FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE GROWING FAST AND FOCUSING RESOURCES ACROSS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PROJECTS. AT ISSUU, OUR PRIORITY IS ON BRINGING AS MANY FEATURES TO PUBLISHERS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO HELP THEM GROW THEIR BUSINESS AND EXPAND THEIR AUDIENCE. STARTING FRESH ON IOS, WE HAD THE FREEDOM TO EXPERIMENT, SINCE THERE WASNT ANY RISK OF IMPINGING ON EXISTING USERS. WE WENT AHEAD AND REGARDED THE NATIVE APP AS A GUIDEPOST, A NORTH STAR INDICATING WHERE WE WANTED TO GO WITH THE BRAND AND EXPERIENCE. WE RECEIVED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK ON THE IOS APPS FUNCTIONALITY AND LOOK AND FEEL, AND WERE USING THIS TO INFORM OUR EVOLVING WEB AND ANDROID PLATFORMS. KEEPING IT LIGHT IN DEVELOPING THE IOS APP, WE SPECIFIED A FAMILY OF COLORS, BUTTON STYLES, TYPOGRAPHY AND PERSONAS TO BE APPLIED ACROSS ISSUU. THERE WAS SOME TECHNICAL WORK TO DO BEFORE WE COULD PUSH THESE CHANGES TO THE ENTIRE WEBSITE. WE REDESIGNED AND RELAUNCHED THE ISSUU HELP CENTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AS AN INCREMENTAL TEST TO SEE HOW IT WOULD AFFECT PERFORMANCE. ALTHOUGH THAT UPDATE DID INDEED CHANGE FUNCTIONALITY, BASED ON OUR CUSTOMER RESPONSES AND USER DATA WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT WE MADE THE RIGHT MOVES. THE TAN HUES IN THE NEW LIGHT THEME OF ISSUU.COM ARE MEANT TO WARM UP THE EXPERIENCE MAKING THE SITE A MORE INVITING AND FRIENDLY PLACE COMPARED WITH THE COLD WHITE, BLUE AND GREEN TONES FOUND BEFORE. SOME OF THE CHANGES ARE MORE SUBTLE: THE NEUTRAL GRAY USED IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE READER IS MEANT TO SHOWCASE OUR PUBLISHERS CONTENT MORE ACCURATELY THAN THE HEAVY BLUE BACKGROUND USED EARLIER, WHICH APPLIED SOMETHING OF A BLUE CAST TO THE CONTENT. TO BE CLEAR, WE HAVE NOT ALTERED FUNCTIONALITY; THIS IS SIMPLY A COLOR SHIFT. ALL THE MENU ITEMS, STACKS AND CONTROLS ARE EXACTLY IN THE SAME PLACE AND WORK THE SAME WAY. WHAT WE SEEK IS A CLEARER HIERARCHY OF EXISTING ELEMENTS, SUCH AS THE SEARCH BOX STANDING OUT IN WHITE, SCREAMING TYPE IN ME! FROM THIS POINT WE ARE MONITORING REACTIONS AND RESPONSES, ISOLATING AND ADDRESSING ANY PROBLEMS THAT ARISE. TYPE THE NEXT CHAPTER ONE ELEMENT THAT IS QUITE CHALLENGING TO CHANGE AT OUR SCALE IS TYPOGRAPHY. AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR MOBILE OFFERINGS, WE NEED TO EMPLOY A TYPE SPEC THAT ADJUSTS TO THE VARIOUS SIZES OF SCREENS FAVORED BY OUR USERS. WE HAVE ADAPTED OUR CURRENT TYPE SPEC OF 4 TO A FAMILY OF TYPE SPECS OF 28. THERE ISNT A DEFINITIVE DATE ON THIS RELEASE, BUT I PLEDGE TO KEEP YOU POSTED. BRAND GUIDELINES WILL BE CHANGING AS WELL WITH OUR NEW BRAND PAGES SHOWING UP SOON, ALONG WITH CLEARER MESSAGES ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT MAKE ISSUU GREAT. WERE ALWAYS DRIVING ADVANCES IN THE ISSUU EXPERIENCE. YET WE MAKE THESE MOVES AS THOUGHTFULLY AS POSSIBLE, AND HOPE YOU FIND THEM TO YOUR LIKING. OUR MISSION IS TO ENABLE PUBLISHERS TO THRIVE AND TO CONNECT READERS WITH THE CONTENT THEY LOVE. HAVE COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS? TWEET AT US @ISSUU . WERE EAGER TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK.

43	BY ZHIQUN ZHU (CHINA DAILY USA) UPDATED: 2015-09-23 11:51:27 PESSIMISM ABOUT US-CHINA RELATIONS SEEMS TO BE PERMEATING THE AIR RECENTLY. MANY OBSERVERS ON BOTH SIDES HAVE RUNG ALARM BELLS ABOUT GROWING TENSION IN THE RELATIONSHIP, ESPECIALLY OVER CYBERSECURITY, THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND STOCK MARKET TURMOIL. WHAT HAS GONE WRONG? HOW CAN THE TWO COUNTRIES MOVE THIS VITAL RELATIONSHIP FORWARD? IN 1940, KENNETH WHERRY, MAYOR OF PAWNEE CITY, NEBRASKA, SAID, "WITH GOD'S HELP, WE WILL LIFT SHANGHAI UP AND UP, EVER UP, UNTIL IT IS JUST LIKE KANSAS CITY." IF WHERRY, WHO BECAME A US SENATOR LATER, WERE STILL ALIVE TODAY, HE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT MODERN SHANGHAI REMAINS DIFFERENT FROM KANSAS CITY, BUT IT IS PROBABLY KANSAS CITY THAT NEEDS TO BE LIFTED UP IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT NOW. AMERICANS HAVE A MISSIONARY IMPULSE TO CHANGE CHINA, EITHER BY CHRISTIANIZING IT IN THE 19TH CENTURY OR DEMOCRATIZING IT IN THE 21ST CENTURY. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF INTERACTIONS, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN DEALING WITH CHINA FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH; IT IS ILL-PREPARED TO LIVE WITH A NATION AS BIG AND ALMOST AS POWERFUL AS ITSELF. CHINA'S METEORIC RE-EMERGENCE AS A GLOBAL POWER BY THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY IS TRULY STUNNING TO AMERICANS AND EVEN TO MANY CHINESE. THE US ECONOMY SUFFERED SERIOUSLY IN THE 2008-2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS, FROM WHICH IT IS STILL RECOVERING. MEANWHILE, THE CHINESE ECONOMY HAS CONTINUED TO CHARGE FORWARD, AND AFTER OVERTAKING JAPAN AS THE WORLD'S SECOND-LARGEST ECONOMY IN 2010, IT IS POISED TO TAKE THE TOP SPOT SOON. THE GLOBAL POWER STRUCTURE HAS CHANGED FUNDAMENTALLY. THE AMERICAN CONCERN ABOUT CHINA'S RISING POWER REFLECTS AMERICANS' LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THEIR COMPETITION WITH CHINA. THE REALITY IS THAT CHINA REMAINS A DEVELOPING COUNTRY DESPITE A LARGE ECONOMY. ACCORDING TO PREMIER LI KEQIANG, 200 MILLION CHINESE STILL LIVE IN POVERTY. CHINA FACES TREMENDOUS DOMESTIC CHALLENGES, INCLUDING A WIDENING INCOME GAP, AN AGING POPULATION, RAMPANT CORRUPTION AND A DETERIORATING ENVIRONMENT. THE UNITED STATES REMAINS FAR AHEAD OF CHINA, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION. THE TWO ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES ARE COMPLEMENTARY IN MANY ASPECTS. A RECENT STUDY BY THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON US-CHINA RELATIONS AND THE RHODIUM GROUP REVEALS THAT FROM 2000 TO 2014, CHINESE FIRMS SPENT NEARLY $46 BILLION ON NEW ESTABLISHMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS IN THE US. CHINESE-AFFILIATED COMPANIES DIRECTLY EMPLOY MORE THAN 80,000 AMERICANS. IF THE US CONTINUES TO WELCOME CHINA'S BOOMING INVESTMENT, IT COULD RECEIVE BETWEEN $100 BILLION TO $200 BILLION FROM CHINA BY 2020, WHICH WOULD ADD BETWEEN 200,000 AND 400,000 FULL-TIME JOBS IN THE US. CHINA IS THE LARGEST TRADING PARTNER OF A GROWING NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, FROM ASIA TO AFRICA AND FROM LATIN AMERICA TO THE MIDDLE EAST. A TRADE REGIME WITHOUT CHINA'S PARTICIPATION IS UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED. CHINA-LED NEW INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE ASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT BANK (AIIB) COMPLEMENT THE WORK OF THE WORLD BANK AND ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK. "PIVOT" AND "NEW TYPE OF GREAT POWER RELATIONS" ARE ATTEMPTS BY THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, RESPECTIVELY, TO HANDLE THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP, BUT THEY ARE POORLY DEFINED AND LARGELY MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE OTHER SIDE. AMERICANS GENERALLY BELIEVE THAT CHINA HAS BECOME MORE ASSERTIVE IN FOREIGN POLICY AND INTENDS TO REPLACE THE US IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS. MANY CHINESE GENUINELY THINK THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING TO BLOCK CHINA'S RISE. LACK OF TRUST HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE OUTSTANDING PROBLEM BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. BUT HOW TO BUILD TRUST? GOING FORWARD, THE TWO COUNTRIES MUST FIRST READJUST THEIR MENTALITY. FOR CHINA, THE PRIORITY REMAINS AT HOME. CHINESE LEADERS MUST RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO FLEX MUSCLES ABROAD. IT IS NOT TIME TO ABANDON DENG XIAOPING'S DICTUM OF LYING LOW AND FOCUSING ON GROWTH. THE UNITED STATES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MUST BE REALISTIC AND REMOVE IDEOLOGICAL LENSES TO OVERCOME THE "CHINA FEAR". IT MUST ALSO REIN IN ITS SMALLER ALLIES IN ASIA SO AS TO AVOID CONFLICTS THAT WILL DRAG THE US AND CHINA INTO DIRECT CONFRONTATION. CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE JOINED AT THE HIP. THERE IS NO BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THEM. THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO ALLOW HARDLINERS OR PROTECTIONISTS TO INTERFERE WITH THE GENERALLY COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP. DISAGREEMENT ON CERTAIN ISSUES AND OCCASIONAL QUARRELS ARE PART OF THE NORMAL LIFE IN A RELATIONSHIP. MUTUAL ACCOMMODATION AND APPRECIATION WILL ENHANCE PERSONAL RELATIONS AS WELL AS RELATIONS BETWEEN NATIONS. ZHIQUN ZHU IS A PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AT BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY IN LEWISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA. (CHINA DAILY USA 09/23/2015 PAGE12)
44	KICKOFF: SATURDAY, 10:30 P.M. ET GAMEDATE: 9/26/15 SITE: SUN DEVIL STADIUM, TEMPE, ARIZ. TV: ESPN SERIES: USC LEADS ARIZONA STATE 19-12, WHICH INCLUDES ONE VICTORY THAT WAS LATER VACATED BECAUSE OF NCAA SANCTIONS. THE SUN DEVILS HAVE WON THREE OF THE PAST FOUR MEETINGS, INCLUDING A 38-34 WIN LAST YEAR ON A HAIL MARY PASS IN THE COLISEUM. RANKINGS: USC 19TH KEYS TO THE GAME USC HEADS TO ARIZONA STATE THIS WEEK IN DESPERATION MODE. IT MIGHT BE TOO EARLY TO PRESS THE PANIC BUTTON AFTER THE TROJANS WERE UPSET IN THE CONFERENCE OPENER, 41-31 AT HOME TO STANFORD, BUT THEIR MARGIN OF ERROR IN THE CHASE FOR THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF VERY LIKELY HAS VANISHED. SO, TOO, MIGHT HOPES OF THE WINNING THE PAC-12 SOUTH IF IT DROPS TO 0-2. "THERE'S OBVIOUSLY STILL A BAD TASTE IN OUR MOUTH BUT I THINK OUR PLAYERS UNDERSTAND THERE'S PLENTY LEFT OUT THERE FOR US THIS SEASON, A GREAT DEAL THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH," COACH STEVE SARKISIAN SAID. USC STILL HAS THE PIECES TO BE GREAT, AND SARKISIAN WAS IN A STAY-THE-COURSE MODE, EVEN AFTER THE DEFENSE WAS GASHED BY STANFORD. "THE NATURAL THING IS TO PANIC, TO ALL OF A SUDDEN SCRAP ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF AND TRY SOMETHING NEW," SARKISIAN SAID. "AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS THING TO DO. WE HAVE TO BELIEVE AND TRUST IN THE WORK WE'VE PUT IN TO GET TO THIS POINT. "THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS, THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO PLAY TO THE STRENGTHS OF OUR TEAM. ... "WE'VE GOT GOOD SCHEMES. WE NEED TO PREPARE OUR PLAYERS BETTER SO THEY CAN GO OUT AND PERFORM BETTER." SARKISIAN MIGHT BE ON THINNER ICE THAN HE TYPICALLY WOULD BECAUSE OF HIS EMBARRASSING PRESEASON ALCOHOL-FUELED INCIDENT AT A BOOSTER EVENT, BUT HE'LL LEAN ON SOME RECENT HISTORY TO BOOST HIS CASE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF RESILIENCY. "I MADE A POINT TO THE TEAM THAT AT JUST ABOUT THIS POINT LAST YEAR, OHIO STATE HAS ALREADY LOST AT HOME TO VIRGINIA TECH AND ARIZONA IS ABOUT TO BEAT OREGON AT HOME," SARKISIAN SAID. "AND THOSE TWO TEAMS GO ON TO PLAY FOR THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. SO WE CAN REBOUND FROM THIS." PLAYERS TO WATCH TROJANS --WR JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER HAS BEEN UNSTOPPABLE SO FAR. THE SOPHOMORE HAS 22 CATCHES FOR 434 YARDS AND FOUR TOUCHDOWNS. ASU LIKES TO BE AGGRESSIVE IN ITS DEFENSE, WHICH MEANS THAT SMITH-SCHUSTER MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE JUST THE FIRST MAN MISS ON HIS WAY TO A BIG GAIN. --CB IMAN MARSHALL HAS PLAYED WELL AS A TRUE FRESHMAN, MAKING 14 TACKLES (THIRD ON THE TEAM) AND BREAKING UP TWO PASSES. HIS ABILITY TO MAKE AN IMPACT RIGHT AWAY CAN LESSEN THE BURDEN ON MULTI-PURPOSE THREAT ADOREE' JACKSON AND ALLOW THE TALENTED SOPHOMORE TO PLAY MORE AT WIDE RECEIVER, AS COACH STEVE SARKISIAN SEES FIT. MARSHALL GOT THE START LAST WEEK WHEN CB KEVON SEYMOUR (KNEE) COULDN'T GO. --RB TRE MADDEN IS THE TEAM'S LEADING RUSHER, BUT HE'S NURSING A KNEE INJURY SUFFERED IN LAST WEEK'S GAME AGAINST STANFORD, WHEN HE RUSHED NINE TIMES FOR 64 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN. HE WAS LIMITED IN PRACTICE EARLY IN THE WEEK.

45	MADISON, WIS. STRUGGLING TO GENERATE FUNDRAISING AND ENTHUSIASM, REPUBLICAN SCOTT WALKER ABANDONED HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID ON MONDAY, EXITING A TURBULENT RACE THAT SAW HIM RISE TO FRONT-RUNNER AND FALL TO AFTERTHOUGHT IN A MATTER OF MONTHS. THE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR, WHO CAST HIMSELF AS A FIGHTER AND A WINNER, PLANNED TO ANNOUNCE HIS DECISION AT A NEWS CONFERENCE MONDAY EVENING IN MADISON, BECOMING THE SECOND MAJOR GOP CANDIDATE TO QUIT THE RACE. "IT HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED TO ME THAT HE IS GETTING OUT OF THE RACE," SAID IOWA STATE SEN. BRAD ZAUN, WHO ENDORSED WALKER EARLIER THIS YEAR. "I'M PROUD OF OUR EFFORTS IN IOWA. AND I THINK HE'S AN INCREDIBLE CANDIDATE. IT'S UNFORTUNATE." ONE OF THE LAST REPUBLICANS TO ENTER THE RACE, WALKER WILL JOIN FORMER TEXAS GOV. RICK PERRY AS ONE OF THE FIRST TO LEAVE IT, HAVING BEEN UNABLE TO ADJUST TO THE POPULARITY OF BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN DONALD TRUMP OR BREAK OUT IN EITHER OF GOP'S FIRST TWO DEBATES. YET COMPARED TO PERRY, WALKER'S FALL WAS DRAMATIC. HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE A TOP-TIER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR AND BUILT A MASSIVE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION, WITH PAID STAFF SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THAT DWARFED MANY OF HIS RIVALS IN SCALE AND SCOPE. "I'M NOT SURE WHAT WENT WRONG," SAID IOWA STATE SEN. MARK COSTELLO, WHO ENDORSED WALKER EARLIER THIS YEAR. "I DON'T THINK HE MADE ANY REALLY BIG MISTAKES, BUT PEOPLE LOST ENTHUSIASM." HE WILL RETURN TO HIS JOB IN WISCONSIN AS GOVERNOR, WHERE HIS TERM RUNS THROUGH 2018. WALKER, 47, TRIED TO APPEAL TO RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES, TEA PARTY CONSERVATIVES AND THE MORE TRADITIONAL GOP BASE. HE TRIED TO CAST HIMSELF AS AN UNINTIMIDATED CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER WHO HAD A RECORD OF VICTORIES IN A STATE THAT HASN'T VOTED REPUBLICAN FOR PRESIDENT SINCE 1984. HE CAME TO THE RACE HAVING WON ELECTION IN WISCONSIN THREE TIMES IN FOUR YEARS, AND HAVING GAINED A NATIONAL FOLLOWING AMONG DONORS AND CONSERVATIVES BY SUCCESSFULLY PUSHING HIS STATE TO STRIP UNION BARGAINING RIGHTS FROM ITS PUBLIC WORKERS. WALKER POINTED TO THOSE WISCONSIN WINS, IN A STATE THAT TWICE VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA AS PRESIDENT, AS SIGNS THAT HE COULD SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE A CONSERVATIVE AGENDA AS THE GOP'S WHITE HOUSE NOMINEE. HE CALLED HIMSELF "AGGRESSIVELY NORMAL" AND CAMPAIGNED ON A HARLEY-DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE, AND MADE A SPLASH IN JANUARY WITH A WELL-RECEIVED SPEECH BEFORE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES IN IOWA. GROUPS BACKING WALKER WENT ON TO RAISE $26 MILLION, TAPPING WEALTHY DONORS WHOM WALKER HAD CULTIVATED IN HIS YEARS AS GOVERNOR AND DURING HIS SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO WIN A RECALL ELECTION IN 2012. WALKER'S PRIMARY SUPER PAC, CALLED UNINTIMIDATED, HAD JUST BEGUN SPENDING, MAKING A MAJOR PUSH IN IOWA REFLECTING THE GOVERNOR'S LAST-DITCH STRATEGY TO PLACE ALL OF HIS CHIPS ON THAT FIRST-TO-VOTE STATE. THE SUPER PAC TOLD FEDERAL REGULATORS IN A FILING FRIDAY THAT IT HAD SPENT MORE THAN $1.6 MILLION BOOSTING WALKER THIS YEAR, MOST RECENTLY ON A $50,000 MAILING TO IOWA VOTERS. BUT WALKER WAS UNABLE TO ADJUST TO TRUMP'S RISE AND REPEATEDLY HAD TROUBLE CLEARLY STATING HIS POSITION ON SEVERAL ISSUES. HE TOOK DAYS TO CLARIFY WHETHER HE SUPPORTED ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP. HE INITIALLY SHOWED INTEREST IN BUILDING A WALL BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CANADA, ONLY TO LATER LAUGH IT OFF AS RIDICULOUS. WALKER ALSO DECLARED HE WASN'T A CAREER POLITICIAN, DESPITE HAVING HELD PUBLIC OFFICE FOR 22 STRAIGHT YEARS. AFTER TRUMP, BEN CARSON AND CARLY FIORINA DISPLACED WALKER AT THE TOP OF THE POLLS, WALKER TOOK A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH, PROMISING TO "WREAK HAVOC" ON WASHINGTON. HE VOWED TO TAKE ON UNIONS AS PRESIDENT, JUST AS HE DID AS WISCONSIN GOVERNOR, OUTLAWING THEM FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS AND MAKING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY RIGHT-TO-WORK. BUT THE ANTI-UNION POLICY PROPOSAL FELL FLAT; ANNOUNCED IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE SECOND GOP DEBATE, IT WASN'T MENTIONED AT ALL BY WALKER OR ANYONE ELSE ON STAGE. WHILE ONLY TEXAS SEN. TED CRUZ AND FORMER FLORIDA GOV. JEB BUSH HAD MORE SUPER PAC MONEY AVAILABLE TO BOOST THEIR CHANCES IN THE ORIGINAL 17-PERSON 2016 REPUBLICAN FIELD, WALKER STRUGGLED TO GENERATE MONEY FOR HIS OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN. HE HAS YET TO REPORT FUNDRAISING TOTALS TO FEDERAL REGULATORS, BUT TOP FUNDRAISERS AND DONORS HAVE SAID HIS PLUMMETING POLL NUMBERS LEFT THEM STRUGGLING TO GENERATE CASH. WALKER CALLED HIS SENIOR STAFF TO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION IN MADISON ON MONDAY TO REVIEW RECENT POLLING, IN WHICH HE WAS MIRED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GOP FIELD, AND HIS CAMPAIGN'S FINANCES. "I'M DISAPPOINTED," SAID STANLEY HUBBARD, A BILLIONAIRE MEDIA MOGUL FROM MINNEAPOLIS WHO HAD BACKED WALKER'S CAMPAIGN. "HE'S A GOOD MAN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD PRESIDENT." AS WORD SPREAD OF HIS DECISION TO EXIT THE RACE, REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES IN IOWA WORKING FOR OTHER CAMPAIGNS WERE ALREADY MAKING PLANS TO CONTACT STATE LAWMAKERS WHO HAD COMMITTED TO SUPPORT WALKER. THE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR HAD ASSEMBLED A CAMPAIGN ORGANIZATION IN EVERY ONE OF IOWA'S 99 COUNTIES AND HAD A NUMBER OF STATE LAWMAKERS COMMITTED TO HIM. CLIFF HURST, ONE OF WALKER'S NEW HAMPSHIRE CO-CHAIRS, WAS ALREADY PLANNING TO SHIFT TO FLORIDA SEN. MARCO RUBIO'S CAMPAIGN. HE SAID HE KNEW ABOUT THREE DAYS AGO THAT "IT WAS OVER" AND HAD BEEN DISCUSSING AN ENDORSEMENT OF RUBIO AS OF MONDAY MORNING, BEFORE WALKER'S ANNOUNCEMENT BECAME OFFICIAL. "IT WAS PERSONALLY HARD, BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S OVER. I KNEW WHEN IT WAS OVER," HURST SAID. "I'M SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ARE @ LESS THAN 1 PERCENT THAT YOU'VE NOT GOING TO GET ANY MONEY." WALKER, ONE OF THE MOST DIVISIVE POLITICAL FIGURES IN WISCONSIN HISTORY, WILL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO REPAIRING HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH VOTERS IN HIS HOME STATE. HIS JOB APPROVAL RATINGS FELL DRAMATICALLY DURING HIS PRESIDENTIAL RUN, HITTING THEIR LOWEST MARK EVER OF 39 PERCENT IN AN AUGUST POLL CONDUCTED BY MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY. WISCONSIN STATE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER ROBIN VOS, A REPUBLICAN AND CLOSE ALLY OF WALKER'S, SAID HE "HAS AN AMAZING STORY TO TELL ABOUT WISCONSIN AND THE REFORMS WE PUT INTO PLACE." BUT VOS SAID HE SUSPECTS WALKER REALIZED HE WOULD HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME TAKING ATTENTION AWAY FROM OTHER CANDIDATES, LIKE TRUMP, WHO ARE "SUCKING UP A LOT OF THE OXYGEN."
46	SOUTH ATLANTIC PETROLEUM, AN INDIGENOUS OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY, HAS SACKED 10 OF ITS WORKERS WHO WERE ASSIGNED TO WORK ON THE SM OILFIELD, OFFSHORE THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN. THE RE-DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIELD WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED IN JUNE THIS YEAR, FOLLOWING THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE FIRST OIL ON THE FIELD. THE DISENGAGED WORKERS, SUPPORTED BY THE PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS SENIOR STAFF ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA, ON MONDAY PICKETED THE COMPANYS HEAD OFFICE IN VICTORIA ISLAND, LAGOS. THE CHAIRMAN, PENGASSAN, SAPETRO BRANCH, MR. EMMANUEL ONUORAH, TOLD OUR CORRESPONDENTS THAT THE WORKERS WERE NOT TOLD THEY WERE EMPLOYED FOR THE PROJECT BUT WERE HIRED AS REGULAR WORKERS AND SECONDED TO WORK ON THE PROJECT TO COMPLETION. HE SAID, THE RESTRUCTURING EXERCISE GOING ON AT SAPETRO, BEING DONE BY PWC, WAS A DIFFERENT THING ENTIRELY FROM THE PROJECT. IT WAS WHEN THE PROJECT FAILED AND THE MANAGEMENT DECIDED IN JUNE THIS YEAR TO CALL IT QUITS THAT THEY NOW MIXED THE TWO TOGETHER. THE RESTRUCTURING WAS EVEN SUPPOSED TO INCREASE OUR STAFF STRENGTH FROM 71 TO 100. WE DRILLED THREE WELLS CSW-1, CS 4 AND CS 5. WHEN WE STARTED DRILLING, THE RESERVES DROPPED FROM EIGHT MILLION BARRELS TO FIVE MILLION BARRELS. ONUORAH SAID OIL OF ABOUT 2,500 BARRELS PER DAY WAS FOUND IN ONE OF THE WELLS, BUT IT WAS VERY VISCOUS. SO, TO FLOW IT FROM THE PLATFORM TO ONSHORE BECAME DIFFICULT. BECAUSE OF THAT, THE COMPANY FELT IT DID NOT HAVE FUNDS AGAIN AND THE PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED, HE ADDED. THE CHAIRMAN, PENGASSAN, LAGOS ZONE, MR. ABEL AGARIN, SAID MEMBERS OF THE UNION DECIDED TO PROTEST AS RESULT OF THE COMPANYS REFUSAL TO RENEGOTIATE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE WORKERS. THE ACTING MANAGING DIRECTOR, SAPETRO, MR. DAN OGUCHE, WHILE CONVEYING THE MANAGEMENTS RESPONSE TO THE PROTEST IN A LETTER TO THE UNION, SAID, PLEASE REFER TO THE MEETING HELD BETWEEN SAPETRO MANAGEMENT AND PENGASSAN TODAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2015 AND BE ADVISED AS FOLLOWS: SAPETRO WILL RECALL THE 10 STAFF DISENGAGED ON AUGUST 31, 2015. A MEETING BETWEEN SAPETRO AND PENGASSAN IS PROPOSED TO TAKE PLACE ON FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2015 FOR 11AM AT THE SAPETRO OFFICE IN LAGOS TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ON THE CBA, REDUNDANCY AND THE RESTRUCTURING EXERCISE.

48	MY OWN NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING BLOG POST/ARTICLE: "EASIER" IS THE WORD SHE IS CONTEMPLATING HERE. DOES LOSING A CHILD OR A MUCH WANTED PREGNANCY GET EASIER? I AGREE WITH "NO". IT GETS BEARABLE. THAT IS THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE ALMOST 4 YEARS OUT. THE DEFINITION OF BEARABLE IS: ABLE TO BE ENDURED, TOLERABLE. IT DIDN'T USED TO FEEL BEARABLE. I WOULD SAY THE GRIEF BECAME BEARABLE SOMETIME BETWEEN YEAR 1 AND 2. BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALL ACTIVE GRIEF. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS I WAS UTTERLY LOST AND CONSUMED BY THE LOSS OF MICHAEL AND ALENA - HAPPINESS FELT PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE. AT 3-6 MONTHS I WAS GETTING INTO THE TERRITORY OF WANTING HAPPINESS AGAIN; OF WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HEAVIEST KIND OF GRIEF WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND I BEGAN FEELING THE NEED TO PARENT MY LOST BABIES THROUGH ACTS. FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR, I WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO HEAL AND FIND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY. GRIEF AT THIS STAGE WAS CONSUMING, BUT NOT ALL-CONSUMING. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS A "NORMAL" PERSON AT ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME. AT THIS POINT IN MY JOURNEY AS A BEREAVED MOTHER, I WOULD SAY MOST WOULD CONSIDER ME A NORMAL, HAPPY, FUNCTIONING MOTHER/WIFE/WOMAN ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. MEANING, I GET ON WITH LIFE, TRYING TO ENJOY EVERYTHING I CAN, WHILE HONORING MY BABIES AND GIVING IN TO THE GRIEF WHEN NECESSARY. THINGS ARE BEARABLE. I'LL NEVER BE AT 100% AGAIN - THERE IS TOO MUCH SCARRING. BUT I WORK EVERY DAY TO GET JUST ONE MORE PERCENT HEALED. MY SKIN IS THICKER AND FOR 11 MONTHS OF THE 12 PER YEAR, I AM SMILING AND ABLE TO GET ON WITH IT. THAT SINGLE MONTH IS VERY NEAR. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BODY...THE NEARING OF OCTOBER. I CAN FEEL THEIR BIRTHDAY APPROACHING; CAN ALMOST HEAR IT, TOUCH IT, SMELL IT. THE LEAVES BEGINNING TO TURN AND THE COOL MORNINGS ARE INDICATORS THAT THE MONTH OF MEMORIES SWIMS NEARER TO ME. I WELCOME THE MEMORIES OF THE TWO BEINGS I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING UP TILL THAT POINT, BUT ALSO SHRINK BACK IN PAIN. THIS WILL BE THE MONTH (ALSO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS), THAT I HAVE TO RELIVE MY KIDS DYING. IT'S THE MONTH I HAVE TO REMEMBER GIVING BIRTH, WHILE TEARS OF HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FALL DOWN MY FACE. IT'S FREAKING PAINFUL. BUT, IT'S BEARABLE. AND I WILL GET THROUGH IT JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, KEEP READING. I LOVED THE WAY THIS WRITER EXPRESSED LIFE AS A BEREAVED PARENT.  IT MIGHT BE TOO EARLY TO PRESS THE PANIC BUTTON AFTER THE TROJANS WERE UPSET IN THE CONFERENCE OPENER, 41-31 AT HOME TO STANFORD, BUT THEIR MARGIN OF ERROR IN THE CHASE FOR THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF VERY LIKELY HAS VANISHED. *COPIED FROM STILL STANDING MAGAZINE* A QUESTION IM FREQUENTLY ASKED BY BEREAVED PARENTS IS, DOES ITEVERGET EASIER? THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES IS PALPABLE. I KNOW. I GET IT. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION STILL SCARES ME TOO BECAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EASIER FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT. AND IT WASNT LONG AGO THAT I WAS ASKING BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WERE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF GRIEF THAN I WAS THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. IM NOT SURE WHEN I STOPPED ASKING IT PROBABLY WHEN I REALIZED IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN. STRADDLING HEAVEN AND EARTH ISNT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE ASEASY. EASIERIS A TRICKY WORD WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING AS PERMANENTLY HORRIFIC AS CHILD LOSS. I LIKE TO RESERVE THE WORDEASIERFOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING A NEW SKILL OVER TIME. EASIER IS A NICE LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEMEASURED.ITS ALSO A LOVELY LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT ARENT IRRETRIEVABLY LOST AND PERMANENTLY MISSING. FOREVER AND EVER. IM CERTAIN THE PROGRESS OF MOVING THROUGH THE UNCHARTED WATERS OF GRIEF AFTER THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS IMMEASURABLE. ITS ONE STEP FORWARD, FOUR STEPS BACK. ITS TREADING WATER, WITH YOUR HEAD SLIGHTLY ABOVE, UNTIL YOURE NOT. ITS SWIMMING ALONG, THEN DROWNING WITHOUT NOTICE. ITS NOT LINEAR. I WILL REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT GRIEF. WHETHER IN A DAY, A YEAR, OR A LIFETIME GRIEF ISNOTLINEAR. EVEN STILL, SEVEN YEARS LATER, I THINK IM SAILING ALONGOK,THEN ALL OF A SUDDENSMACKOUT OF NOWHERE GRIEF BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. SOMETIMES IT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF A STRATEGICALLY PLACED GORGEOUS NINE YEAR OLD, BLUE-EYED LITTLE BOY WHO SHOULD BE MY LIVING BREATHING OLDEST SON, BUT WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER MOTHER WHO IS CALLING AFTER HIM; SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM THE MISSING PUZZLE PIECE OF MY HEART THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF MY SON THAT STARTS OOZING UNCONTROLLABLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND TEARS LEAK OUT OF MY EYES WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. SOMETIMES ITS THE SIMPLE, ALMOST-PERFECT MOMENTS WITH MY 2/3RDS CHILDREN, THAT SMACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD AND ROB MY LUNGS OF PROPER BREATH. BREATHE,I GASP.BREATHE. THE THING ABOUT LIFE AFTER LOSS IS THAT NO MATTER WHATSOMEONE IS ALWAYS MISSING.NO MATTER WHAT, MY FAMILY IS ALWAYS ACHINGLYINCOMPLETE.I COULD HAVE FOUR MORE CHILDREN, AND THESE FACTS WOULD STILL REMAIN, STARING ME DOWN LIKE A CRUEL BULLY WHO WILL TORMENT ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT BACK. THE REALITY OF CHILD LOSS IS THAT THE WRONG CAN NEVER BE MADE RIGHT. IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED. EVER. LIFE IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN WITHOUT OUR LIVING, BREATHING CHILD(REN) IN IT. LIFE WILL NEVER FEEL A-OKAY AGAIN. SURE IT WILL HAVE MOMENTS OF BITTERSWEET JOY, AND BITTERSWEET HAPPINESS, AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LAUGH AGAIN, AND FIND STUPID THINGS FUNNY, BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE WHAT ITONCE WAS. THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THAT TWITTERPATED FEELING OF HAPPINESS THE KIND THAT FEELS NAIVE NOW, THE KIND YOU WONDER IF EVER EXISTED AT ALL? YOU MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. YOU CANT FIX IT, MEND IT, OR EVEN CRY IT AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS GO BY,THE ACHE REMAINS. SO BACK TOTHEQUESTION DOES IT EVER GET EASIER? THE HARD TRUTH IS A RESOUNDINGNO. NOT FOR ME, ANYWAY. IT HASNT GOTTENEASIERTO LIVE WITHOUT A HUGE PIECE OF MY HEART. GRIEF IS ALWAYS THERE, LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WALK THIS EARTH WITHOUT MY SON. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO BREATHE WHILE CHOKING ON AIR. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE NORMAL ANSWERS TO NORMAL QUESTIONS ANYMORE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS LIVING IN THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, SOUND LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OF GRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN HARD. WHETHER YOURE A DAY IN, OR 20 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO  HARD. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD, OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION. SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD. AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE CAN HONOR OUR PRECIOUS CHILD WITH EVERY BREATH WE TAKE. WE CAN AND WILL BE HAPPY AGAINANDIM GUESSING IT WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS FEEL DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT OUR CHILD. WE LIVEANDWE GRIEVE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER, IT JUST BECOMESDIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT CALL THAT PESSIMISM, BUT FOR ME, ITSTRUTH. ITS SIMPLY THE REALITY OF BEREAVED PARENTHOOD. NOTE: GRIEF IS AS UNIQUE AS EACH PERSONS FINGERPRINT. IVE MET PLENTY OF BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WOULD SAY A RESOUNDING YES, GRIEF DOES GET EASIER OVER TIME. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR THEM. EASIER JUST ISNT THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. EACH PERSONS EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT. NO TWO PEOPLE GRIEVE THE SAME. AND OUR JOB IS TO MEET EVERYONES EXPERIENCE/REALITY WITH UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT AND LOVE.

WITH MORE POWER, A SHARPER CHASSIS, STRONGER BRAKES AND EXTRA EQUIPMENT, THE NEW NISSAN JUKE NISMO RS BUILDS ON THE EXISTING AND HUGELY POPULAR NISSAN JUKE NISMO TO CREATE A MORE EXTREME VERSION OF THE TOP SELLING COMPACT CROSSOVER. LIKE EVERY NISMO MODEL, THE RS IS INFUSED WITH MOTORSPORT INSPIRED DESIGN, AERODYNAMICS AND ENGINEERING TO DELIVER THRILLING PERFORMANCE AND HANDLING IN A ROAD CAR.

REVISED SPRING AND DAMPER SETTINGS COMPLETE THE CHASSIS CHANGES. THE JUKE NISMO RS IS SET APART WITH RED BRAKE CALLIPERS AND DISCREET RS' BADGING ON THE FRONT AND REAR. INSIDE, THE RS LOGO APPEARS IN THE REV COUNTER WHILE A DISTINCTIVE SUEDE WRAP COVERS THE INSTRUMENT BINNACLE. THE FINAL FINISHING TOUCH INSIDE IS AN UNUSUAL WATER PRINT FINISH ON THE SHIFT KNOB/PADDLE SHIFTERS AND THE CENTRAL CLUSTER. OPTIONS ON THE RS VERSION INCLUDE SPECIAL RECARO SPORTS "BUCKET" SEATS, XENON HEADLAMPS, NISSAN'S AROUND VIEW MONITOR AND SAFETY SHIELD WHICH INCLUDES LANE DEPARTURE WARNING, BLIND SPOT WARNING AND MOVING OBJECT DETECTION GIVING VISUAL AND AUDIBLE WARNINGS TO AVOID POTENTIAL COLLISIONS.

54	SINGERS NICKI MINAJ AND MILEY CYRUS HAD A PUBLIC SPAT AT THE 2415 VMAS, HOSTED BY MILEY.  ALL THE INDIVIDUAL ATHLETES DID THE GYM PROUD AND I THINK WE ALL LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE OUR FITNESS IS AT AND WHAT WE NEED TO WORK ON. DURING THE LIVE BROADCAST ON SUNDAY, NICKI CALLED MILEY A "BITCH" FOR TALKING ABOUT HER IN THE PRESS. ACCORDING TO AN INSIDER, "NICKI WAS LIVID WITH MILEY AND DECIDED TO AIR HER FEELINGS ONSTAGE." IN FACT, IT WAS REPORTED THAT MTV STAFFERS HAD TO KEEP NICKI AND MILEY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER FOR THE NIGHT TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION.  BUT ITS A COG IN A MACHINE THAT DOES SOMETHING GREAT! IT IS HARD TO KNOW IF THEIR FIGHTING WAS STAGED OR AUTHENTIC. EITHER WAY, IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SHOUTING ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS IN PUBLIC WHEN YOU'RE UPSET IS THE BEST WAY TO GET YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS. IN NICKI'S CASE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A STRONG DESIRE TO REACH HER FAN BASE AND SHARE HER RAGE TOWARD MILEY. MAYBE SHE THOUGHT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE FACE. BUT IT REALLY ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING WITH A PARTNER IN FRONT OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS AT A HOLIDAY MEAL. SO WHEN YOU'RE IRKED AT SOMEONE, WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO LET THEM KNOW - TALK TO THEM IN PRIVATE ABOUT IT, OR LET THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW' VERY OFTEN WHEN WE ARE MAD AT SOMEONE WHO HAS HURT OUR FEELINGS OUR INCLINATION IS TO GET BACK AT THEM BY LETTING OTHERS KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO MAKE US FEEL MISTREATED AND WRONGED. IN FACT, THAT DYNAMIC IS THE HOOK OF REALITY TELEVISION. DOING THAT, THOUGH, AND BEING VOCAL ABOUT THE BAD ENERGY BETWEEN YOU MAY UNWITTINGLY PUT THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BY MAKING THEM FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE SIDES. SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET SO CAUGHT UP IN THE ANGER OF THE MOMENT THAT IT CAN SPILLOVER BEYOND THEIR PRIVATE WORLD, AS WE SAW WITH NICKI AND MILEY. BEFORE YOU LET THAT HAPPEN, ASK YOURSELF IF THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP WORTH SAVING. IF YOU DECIDE IT IS, THEN THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO GO RIGHT TO THE SOURCE AND ADDRESS THE CAUSE OF YOUR DISTRESS DIRECTLY WITH THE PERSON WHO UPSET YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE. TELL THEM WHAT THEY SAID AND DID TO SET YOU OFF, AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE AND EXPLAIN. IT WILL ALSO GIVE THE PERSON THE CHANCE TO CLEAR UP ANY MISCOMMUNICATION OR MISUNDERSTANDING THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN YOU. FIGHTING OUT IN THE OPEN JUST SERVES TO FAN THE FLAMES OF THE FURY, BUT A STRAIGHT CONVERSATION MIGHT CLEAR THE AIR AND EVEN HELP TO SALVAGE YOUR RELATIONSHIP. THIS YEAR'S VMAS WERE ALSO WITNESS TO A NUMBER OF BAD FEELINGS BEING SOOTHED, SUCH AS BETWEEN KANYE WEST AND TAYLOR SWIFT. THAT IS TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT NO MATTER HOW ANGRY SOMEONE MIGHT BE AT ONE TIME, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET OVER IT AND MOVE BEYOND IT. THE RAGE CAN DIMINISH AND YOU CAN LET IT GO. WHO KNOWS' MAYBE AT NEXT YEAR'S AWARDS SHOW WE WILL SEE A DIFFERENT EXCHANGE BETWEEN NICKI AND MILEY.PLEASE TUNE IN TO THE DOCTOR ON CALL RADIO HOUR ON HEALTHYLIFE.NET EVERY TUESDAY AT 2 PM EST, 54 AM PST.  WELL ASK STATES TO DESIGN AMBITIOUS PLANS USING THE PROGRAMS THAT MAKE MOST SENSE FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES NEEDS.  SO BACK TOTHEQUESTION DOES IT EVER GET EASIER?

55	PEYTON MANNING'S SUMMER WAS BOTH DAZZLING AND PERPLEXING. PRACTICES CONSISTED OF SPRINT-OUTS, ROLL-OUTS AND BOOTLEGS FROM UNDER CENTER, PLAY-ACTION PASSES FROM THE PISTOL FORMATION AND SCRAMBLES FOR FIRST DOWNS IN DEFIANCE OF HIS 39-YEAR-OLD LEGS. PRESEASON GAMES WERE FILLED WITH EMPTY BACKFIELDS AND SHOTGUN FORMATIONS THAT PRODUCED A PAUCITY OF POINTS AND PLENTY OF ANGST AMONG BRONCOS FANS AND FANTASY FOOTBALL OWNERS ALIKE. WHICH MANNING SHOWS UP SUNDAY IS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE. "THE LAST THREE YEARS HE'S BEEN HERE, THERE WERE (PRESEASON) GAMES WE DIDN'T SCORE POINTS AND WE'D COME OUT AND SCORE 35, 42 POINTS" IN THE OPENER, WIDE RECEIVER DEMARYIUS THOMAS SAID. "SO, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BY DESIGN OR NOT, BUT IT HAPPENS." IF MANNING IS CONCERNED THAT HE DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN AUGUST, HE DIDN'T SHOW IT WEDNESDAY. "HEY, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SUNDAY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM," MANNING SAID. "WE'VE GOT SOME NEW GUYS PLAYING AND WE'VE GOT SOME NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO. I'VE SAID ALL ALONG THE KEY FOR US IS TO IMPROVE THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF A GAME. "BALTIMORE'S AN EXCELLENT DEFENSE. ARE YOU GOING TO DOMINATE ALL FOUR QUARTERS? I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S EVER DONE THAT AGAINST BALTIMORE, BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WIN ENOUGH PLAYS AND BE EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO WIN THE FOOTBALL GAME." RAVENS COACH JOHN HARBAUGH SAID ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES HE'S FACING THIS WEEK AS HE PREPARES FOR THE OPENER WAS FIGURING OUT HOW BRONCOS COACH GARY KUBIAK, HIS FORMER OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WAS ADAPTING HIS SCHEME TO FIT MANNING'S SKILLS. "THE TEAMS THAT PLAY HIM IN WEEK 3 AND 4 AND 5 AND 6 AND DOWN THE ROAD WILL HAVE A BETTER FEEL FOR THAT THAN WE WILL," HARBAUGH SAID. "I'M SURE THAT THEY DIDN'T SHOW IN THE PRESEASON EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE PLANNING ON DOING." THE BRONCOS SHOWED ALMOST NOTHING IN THE PRESEASON, IN PART BECAUSE MANNING NEVER HAD PRO BOWL RECEIVERS THOMAS AND EMMANUEL SANDERS TOGETHER WITH HIM ON THE FIELD. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO USE TRAINING CAMP TO GET A FEEL FOR THE FUTURE. GENERAL MANAGER JOHN ELWAY SAID HE LIKED WHAT HE SAW IN BROCK OSWEILER, WHO'S ENTERING HIS FOURTH SEASON AS MANNING'S BACKUP. HE ALSO LIKED ROOKIE TREVOR SIEMIAN, SO MUCH SO THAT HE HAD TO KEEP THE FORMER NORTHWESTERN QB ON THE 53-MAN ROSTER RATHER THAN RISK TRYING TO SLIP HIM THROUGH TO THE PRACTICE SQUAD. MANNING MADE CAMEOS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD EXHIBITION GAMES AND DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN NINE FULL POSSESSIONS. HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PLAYED MORE AND BETTER BUT WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS PREPARATION FOR HIS 18TH NFL SEASON. HARBAUGH MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO EXPECT SUNDAY, BUT HE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF KUBIAK AND HIS TOP LIEUTENANT, RICK DENNISON, LAST YEAR, RAVENS QUARTERBACK JOE FLACCO HAD THE BEST SEASON OF HIS SEVEN-YEAR CAREER. "I'M SURE THAT PEYTON IS HAVING A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM," FLACCO SAID. "... THEY JUST HELPED ME PLAY FAST, PLAY WITH A QUIET MIND, BE CONFIDENT AND MAKE QUICK DECISIONS. I THINK THAT OUR LINE PLAYED REALLY WELL LAST YEAR UNDER THEIR PROTECTION SCHEME AND I THINK THAT HELPED OUT A TON." THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR MANNING, WHO HAS FOUR NEW O-LINEMEN, INCLUDING TWO NOVICES IN LEFT TACKLE TY SAMBRAILO AND CENTER MATT PARADIS. RAVENS RUNNING BACK JUSTIN FORSETT WENT FROM JOURNEYMAN TO PRO BOWLER IN KUBIAK'S ZONE BLOCKING SCHEME LAST YEAR, AND HARBAUGH SAID DENVER PRO BOWLER C.J. ANDERSON SHOULD BE IN FOR A SIMILARLY SPECTACULAR SEASON. "HE'S A DOWNHILL, ONE-CUT, VERY PHYSICAL GUY," HARBAUGH SAID. "DIFFERENT KINDS OF BACKS ARE GOOD IN THIS SCHEME, BUT THEY'VE GOT TWO OF THEM. RONNIE HILLMAN DOES IT DIFFERENTLY THAN C.J. DOES IT. I THINK THEY'VE GOT TWO GUYS WITH DIFFERENT STYLES THAT RUN THE SCHEME VERY WELL." NOTES: PLAYERS VOTED MANNING, DE DEMARCUS WARE AND S DAVID BRUTON JR. AS TEAM CAPTAINS. ... DE KENNY ANUNIKE (KNEE) WAS THE ONLY PLAYER TO SIT OUT PRACTICE. --- AP NFL WEBSITE: WWW.PRO32.AP.ORG AND WWW.TWITTER.COM/AP-NFL

IT HASNT GOTTENEASIERTO LIVE WITHOUT A HUGE PIECE OF MY HEART. GRIEF IS ALWAYS THERE, LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WALK THIS EARTH WITHOUT MY SON. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO BREATHE WHILE CHOKING ON AIR. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE NORMAL ANSWERS TO NORMAL QUESTIONS ANYMORE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS LIVING IN THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, SOUND LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR  THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OF GRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN HARD. WHETHER YOURE A DAY IN, OR 20 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO HARD. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD, OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION. SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD. AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE CAN HONOR OUR PRECIOUS CHILD WITH EVERY BREATH WE TAKE. WE CAN AND WILL BE HAPPY AGAINANDIM GUESSING IT WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS FEEL DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT OUR CHILD. WE LIVEANDWE GRIEVE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER, IT JUST BECOMESDIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT CALL THAT PESSIMISM, BUT FOR ME, ITSTRUTH. ITS SIMPLY THE REALITY OF BEREAVED PARENTHOOD. NOTE: GRIEF IS AS UNIQUE AS EACH PERSONS FINGERPRINT.  AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR THEM. EASIER JUST ISNT THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. EACH PERSONS EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT.  AND OUR JOB IS TO MEET EVERYONES EXPERIENCE/REALITY WITH UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT AND LOVE. ANGELA MILLER IS A WRITER, SPEAKER AND GRIEF ADVOCATE WHO PROVIDES SUPPORT AND SOLACE TO THOSE WHO ARE GRIEVING THE LOSS OF A CHILD. SHE IS THE AUTHOR OFYOU ARE THE MOTHER OF ALL MOTHERS: A MESSAGE OF HOPE FOR THE GRIEVING HEART, FOUNDER OF THE AWARD-WINNING ONLINE COMMUNITYA BED FOR MY HEART. MY OWN NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING BLOG POST/ARTICLE: "EASIER" IS THE WORD SHE IS CONTEMPLATING HERE. DOES LOSING A CHILD OR A MUCH WANTED PREGNANCY GET EASIER? I AGREE WITH "NO". IT GETS BEARABLE. THAT IS THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE ALMOST 4 YEARS OUT.  IT DIDN'T USED TO FEEL BEARABLE. I WOULD SAY THE GRIEF BECAME BEARABLE SOMETIME BETWEEN YEAR 1 AND 2. BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALL ACTIVE GRIEF. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS I WAS UTTERLY LOST AND CONSUMED BY THE LOSS OF MICHAEL AND ALENA - HAPPINESS FELT PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE. AT 3-6 MONTHS I WAS GETTING INTO THE TERRITORY OF WANTING HAPPINESS AGAIN; OF WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HEAVIEST KIND OF GRIEF WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND I BEGAN FEELING THE NEED TO PARENT MY LOST BABIES THROUGH ACTS. FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR, I WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO HEAL AND FIND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY. GRIEF AT THIS STAGE WAS CONSUMING, BUT NOT ALL-CONSUMING. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS A "NORMAL" PERSON AT ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME. AT THIS POINT IN MY JOURNEY AS A BEREAVED MOTHER, I WOULD SAY MOST WOULD CONSIDER ME A NORMAL, HAPPY, FUNCTIONING MOTHER/WIFE/WOMAN ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. MEANING, I GET ON WITH LIFE, TRYING TO ENJOY EVERYTHING I CAN, WHILE HONORING MY BABIES AND GIVING IN TO THE GRIEF WHEN NECESSARY. THINGS ARE BEARABLE. I'LL NEVER BE AT 100% AGAIN - THERE IS TOO MUCH SCARRING. BUT I WORK EVERY DAY TO GET JUST ONE MORE PERCENT HEALED. MY SKIN IS THICKER AND FOR 11 MONTHS OF THE 12 PER YEAR, I AM SMILING AND ABLE TO GET ON WITH IT. THAT SINGLE MONTH IS VERY NEAR. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BODY...THE NEARING OF OCTOBER. I  CAN FEEL THEIR BIRTHDAY APPROACHING; CAN ALMOST HEAR IT, TOUCH IT, SMELL IT. THE LEAVES BEGINNING TO TURN AND THE COOL MORNINGS ARE INDICATORS THAT THE MONTH OF MEMORIES SWIMS NEARER TO ME. I WELCOME THE MEMORIES OF THE TWO BEINGS I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING UP TILL THAT POINT, BUT ALSO SHRINK BACK IN PAIN. THIS WILL BE THE MONTH (ALSO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS), THAT I HAVE TO RELIVE MY KIDS DYING. IT'S THE MONTH I HAVE TO REMEMBER GIVING BIRTH, WHILE TEARS OF HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FALL DOWN MY FACE. IT'S FREAKING PAINFUL. BUT, IT'S BEARABLE. AND I WILL GET THROUGH IT JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, KEEP READING. I LOVED THE WAY THIS WRITER EXPRESSED LIFE AS A BEREAVED PARENT. *COPIED FROM STILL STANDING MAGAZINE* A QUESTION IM FREQUENTLY ASKED BY BEREAVED PARENTS IS, DOES ITEVERGET EASIER? THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES IS PALPABLE. I KNOW. I GET IT. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION STILL SCARES ME TOO BECAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EASIER FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT. AND IT WASNT LONG AGO THAT I WAS ASKING BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WERE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF GRIEF THAN I WAS THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. IM NOT SURE WHEN I STOPPED ASKING IT PROBABLY WHEN I REALIZED IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN. STRADDLING HEAVEN AND EARTH ISNT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE ASEASY. EASIERIS A TRICKY WORD WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING AS PERMANENTLY HORRIFIC AS CHILD LOSS. I LIKE TO RESERVE THE WORDEASIERFOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING A NEW SKILL OVER TIME. EASIER IS A NICE LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEMEASURED.ITS ALSO A LOVELY LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT ARENT IRRETRIEVABLY LOST AND PERMANENTLY MISSING. FOREVER AND EVER. IM CERTAIN THE PROGRESS OF MOVING THROUGH THE UNCHARTED WATERS OF GRIEF AFTER THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS IMMEASURABLE. ITS ONE STEP FORWARD, FOUR STEPS BACK. ITS TREADING WATER, WITH YOUR HEAD SLIGHTLY ABOVE, UNTIL YOURE NOT. ITS SWIMMING ALONG, THEN DROWNING WITHOUT NOTICE. ITS NOT LINEAR. I WILL REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT GRIEF. WHETHER IN A DAY, A YEAR, OR A LIFETIME GRIEF ISNOTLINEAR. EVEN STILL, SEVEN YEARS LATER, I THINK IM SAILING ALONGOK,THEN ALL OF A SUDDENSMACKOUT OF NOWHERE GRIEF BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. SOMETIMES IT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF A STRATEGICALLY PLACED GORGEOUS NINE YEAR OLD, BLUE-EYED LITTLE BOY WHO SHOULD BE MY LIVING BREATHING OLDEST SON, BUT WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER MOTHER WHO IS CALLING AFTER HIM; SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM THE MISSING PUZZLE PIECE OF MY HEART THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF MY SON THAT STARTS OOZING UNCONTROLLABLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND TEARS LEAK OUT OF MY EYES WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. SOMETIMES ITS THE SIMPLE, ALMOST-PERFECT MOMENTS WITH MY 2/3RDS CHILDREN, THAT SMACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD AND ROB MY LUNGS OF PROPER BREATH. BREATHE,I GASP.BREATHE. THE THING ABOUT LIFE AFTER LOSS IS THAT NO MATTER WHATSOMEONE IS ALWAYS MISSING.NO MATTER WHAT, MY FAMILY IS ALWAYS ACHINGLYINCOMPLETE.I COULD HAVE FOUR MORE CHILDREN, AND THESE FACTS WOULD STILL REMAIN, STARING ME DOWN LIKE A CRUEL BULLY WHO WILL TORMENT ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT BACK. THE REALITY OF CHILD LOSS IS THAT THE WRONG CAN NEVER BE MADE RIGHT. IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED. EVER. LIFE IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN WITHOUT OUR LIVING, BREATHING CHILD(REN) IN IT. LIFE WILL NEVER FEEL A-OKAY AGAIN. SURE IT WILL HAVE MOMENTS OF BITTERSWEET JOY, AND BITTERSWEET HAPPINESS, AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LAUGH AGAIN, AND FIND STUPID THINGS FUNNY, BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE WHAT ITONCE WAS. THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THAT TWITTERPATED FEELING OF HAPPINESS THE KIND THAT FEELS NAIVE NOW, THE KIND YOU WONDER IF EVER EXISTED AT ALL? YOU MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. YOU CANT FIX IT, MEND IT, OR EVEN CRY IT AWAY.
58	LET ME SAY FIRST OFF: NOBODY KNOWS WHETHER WYOMINGS PLAN TO CONSERVE SAGE GROUSE IS GOING TO WORK. IF SOMEBODY DOES CLAIM TO KNOW WITH CERTAINTY, THEN YOU HAVE GOOD REASON TO BE SKEPTICAL. THATS BECAUSE SAGE GROUSE CONSERVATION IS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM WITHIN AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX NATURAL SYSTEM. WYOMINGS UPDATED PLAN, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE SPECIES MOST IMPORTANT HABITATS -- THEIR CORE AREAS -- MIGHT BE THE BIRDS BEST BET. BUT LIKE ANY PLAN, THE SUCCESS OF WYOMINGS CONSERVATION STRATEGY, AND SIMILAR STRATEGIES IN OTHER WESTERN STATES, WILL ULTIMATELY COME DOWN TO HOW WELL THE PLANS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY WE CAN ADAPT TO NEW INFORMATION AND EMERGING SCIENCE. WHATS NOTABLE IS THAT THIS EFFORT MIGHT WELL BE A MODEL FOR A NEW KIND OF APPROACH: A HOMEGROWN, STAKEHOLDER-INCLUSIVE, COLLABORATIVE MEANS TO CONSERVATION WHERE IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. RANCHERS, BIOLOGISTS, INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES, CONSERVATIONISTS, AGENCY AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND OTHERS ARE INVOLVED IN CRAFTING THE PLAN AND THUS HAVE STRONG BUY-IN FOR ASSURING ITS IMPLEMENTATION. FOR READERS WHO DONT KNOW, WYOMINGS PLAN IS THE PRODUCT OF AN UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATIVE EFFORT IN RECENT YEARS TO CONSERVE THE GREATER SAGE-GROUSE, WHICH IS ONE OF WYOMINGS AND THE WESTS MOST ICONIC, BEAUTIFUL -- AND IMPERILED -- SPECIES. GOVS. DAVE FREUDENTHAL AND MATT MEAD BOTH UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS AT STAKE: IF THE SAGE GROUSE WERE LISTED AS A THREATENED OR ENDANGERED SPECIES, ENERGY EXTRACTION AND OTHER TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT WOULD LIKELY BE CURTAILED THROUGHOUT THE BIRDS RANGE, AND NOT ONLY IN CORE HABITAT AREAS. IN A STATE THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON REVENUES FROM MINERAL EXTRACTION, SUCH A POSSIBILITY GETS FOLKS ATTENTION. IF WYOMING HADNT STEPPED UP WHEN IT DID, ITS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROTECTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN BOTH NECESSARY AND UNAVOIDABLE. SOMETIMES JUST THE THREAT OF THIS KIND OF FEDERAL ACTION CAN BE THE IMPETUS FOR BETTER WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES. OUR GOVERNORS APPROACH HAS BEEN TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE IN WYOMING, WHERE AN ESTIMATED 40 PERCENT OF THE REMAINING SAGE-GROUSE LIVE. FREUDENTHAL LED THE EFFORT TO CREATE WHAT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE STATES CORE AREA STRATEGY. MEAD HAS FURTHERED THAT EFFORT, REFINING THIS STRATEGY TWICE ALREADY, AS NEW INFORMATION AND NEW SCIENCE HAS EMERGED. THEY EMPOWERED A BROAD GROUP OF CITIZENS, EXPERTS AND SCIENTISTS TO WORK ON THE PROBLEM YEAR AFTER YEAR, DRAWING UPON UPON LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND STAKEHOLDER EXPERTISE, WITH THE COMMON GOAL OF MAKING SURE MEASURES ARE TAKEN SO THAT AN ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING DECISION IS NOT NECESSARY. THAT GOAL HAS BEEN, AND REMAINS, A TALL ORDER. SAGE GROUSE AND SAGE GROUSE HABITAT ARE IN TROUBLE. THE SPECIES HAS BEEN IN STEADY DECLINE FOR A LONG TIME NOW, AND ITS ESTIMATED THAT TODAY THERE ARE ABOUT 80 PERCENT TO 90 PERCENT FEWER SAGE GROUSE RANGE-WIDE THAN THERE WERE 150-200 YEARS AGO. WYOMINGS ACTIONS WILL LIKELY PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DETERMINING WHETHER OVERALL SAGE GROUSE POPULATIONS BEGIN TO STABILIZE OR CONTINUE TO DECLINE. MY OPINION: THE STATES PLAN CAN WORK IF ITS FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED. AND WHILE I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE, I ALSO KNOW THAT A GOOD PLAN CAN JUST AS QUICKLY BECOME AN EMPTY PROMISE IF COMMITMENT WAVERS. WYOMING WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN FOR DECADES, LONG AFTER THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE MAKES ITS LISTING DECISION THIS MONTH. STATE REGULATORS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL BE FACED WITH TOUGH DECISIONS AND BEFORE LONG THEY WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ALLOWING DEVELOPMENT OR PROTECTING IMPORTANT HABITAT -- THAT WILL BE THE TEST. AND YEARS FROM NOW I HOPE THIS ADMINISTRATIONS LEGACY IS NOT THAT IT KEPT THE BIRD OFF THE LIST IN 2015 BUT THAT IT KEPT IT FROM EXTINCTION. CRAFTING THE PLAN WAS THE EASY PART. LIVING UP TO ITS PROMISE? NOW THAT WILL TAKE SOME WORK.
59	MT. PLEASANT NEWS WINFIELD ZONING IS ALIVE AND WELL IN WINFIELD FOLLOWING ACTION BY THE CITY COUNCIL THURSDAY NIGHT. MEETING IN SPECIAL SESSION, THE COUNCIL APPOINTED FIVE LOCAL CITIZENS TO THE CITYS BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT/PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION. THE APPOINTEES INCLUDE LINDA SHARP, PAUL BEATY, TOM RODRUCK, JERRY FRICKE AND CHRIS FINNELL. FINNELL, WHO ALSO SERVES AS WINFIELD MAYOR, DID NOT SEE SERVING ON THE BOARD AND COMMISSION AS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. I AM THE MAYOR, BUT TECHNICALLY I AM NOT ON THE COUNCIL, I DO NOT HAVE A VOTE (ON COUNCIL). IF THIS DOESNT FLY, WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER MEETING, FINNELL SAID. COUNCIL MEMBER JAN WALTER SAID SHE DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FINNELL SERVING ON THE BOARD AND COMMISSION. WE CAN APPROVE IT AND IF IT IS A PROBLEM, WE CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE. THE COUNCILS ACTION THURSDAY NIGHT RESULTED FROM A DISCUSSION WITH JOE BUFFINGTON, HENRY COUNTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING AND ZONING, DURING THE COUNCILS REGULAR MONTHLY MEETING ON SEPT. 14. BUFFINGTON TOLD THE COUNCIL THAT WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT, IT PUTS THE COMMUNITY IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION REGARDING ZONING. YOU DONT HAVE THE TOOLS IN PLACE (WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT) TO HAVE ZONING, PERIOD, BUFFINGTON TOLD THE COUNCIL AT ITS PREVIOUS MEETING. YOU DONT HAVE A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT SO THERE IS NO DUE PROCESS. IF YOU HAVE CHALLENGES (TO ZONING ORDINANCES), IT COULD BE A MESS BECAUSE YOU LOST YOUR ABILITY TO ZONE WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. IN ORDER TO HAVE ZONING, YOU MUST HAVE A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. THE CITY, BUFFINGTON SAID, COULD HAVE THE SAME CITIZENS ON BOTH THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT AND PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION. A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT IS COMPRISED OF FIVE MEMBERS AND HANDLES ZONING AND VARIANCE MATTERS. WALTER, WHO SERVED AS CITY CLERK FOR THREE DECADES SAID THE COMMUNITY HASNT HAD A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT FOR AT LEAST A DECADE. SHE SAID THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE LACK OF A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT WAS FINDING PEOPLE WILLING TO SERVE ON THE BOARD. IN THE ONLY OTHER AGENDA MATTER, THE COUNCIL SET A 4 P.M. HEARING MONDAY, OCT. 12, FOR THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT TO CONSIDER A VARIANCE FOR THE WINFIELD HEALTH CARE AND RETIREMENT CENTER. THE COUNCILS NEXT MEETING WILL ALSO BE ON MONDAY, OCT. 12, AT 7 P.M. IN CITY HALL.
60	BLOG FALL CHALLENGE REVIEW LETS START BY THROWING OUT A HUGE THANK YOU TO DAVE, CHRIS AND JESSE THE OWNERS OF THE WEST COAST TRIPLE CROWN FOR HOSTING ANOTHER FANTASTIC EVENT. AS ALWAYS IT WAS RIGHT ON SCHEDULE WITH NO LONG BREAKS AND THE PROGRAMMING WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND BATTLE TESTED. MY GUESS IS EVERY WORKOUT WENT EXACTLY HOW THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL THE VOLUNTEERS WHO GAVE UP THEIR TIME TO JUDGE AND HELP SETUP FOR THIS EVENT. I PERSONALLY DONT DO ENOUGH VOLUNTEERING AT LOCAL EVENTS AND I PLAN ON CHANGING THAT IN THE FUTURE AND I HOPE SOME OF YOU WILL AS WELL. EVENT LIKE THESE CANT GO OFF WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE COMMUNITY. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THEY DONT MAKE ENOUGH DOING THESE TO PAY EVERYONE. IT WAS SO AWESOME THAT SO MANY OF YOU LIONS FAITHFUL CAME UP TO SQUAMISH ON A HORRIBLE RAINY WEEKEND TO SUPPORT OUR ATHLETES. VANESSA (AKA MIKE TYSON), KARINA, ANNIE, SCOTT, KATHRYN,JEFF, PAULINE, MRS HARRISON, MY MOM, JOHN ON SATURDAY, CHRISTI ON SATURDAY, OWEN ON SUNDAY. IT REALLY MEANT A TON TO EVERYONE TO HAVE YOU GUYS CHEERING. PERSONALLY I HEARD EVERY CHEER WHILE ON THE FLOOR. SATURDAY THE INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION RECAP: TEAM LIONS FOR SATURDAY WAS GILL FOR THE LADIES AND THEN MYSELF, BRETT, OWEN, SHAYAN AND MIKE. GILL: FINISHED ON THE PODIUM FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WITH A 3RD PLACE OVERALL FINISH. HER WEEKEND WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A DOMINATING FIRST PLACE PERFORMANCE IN THE 5K RUN AND A 4TH PLACE FINISH IN THE CROSSFITTY CROSSFIT WOD.

SHAYAN FINISHED 17TH IN THE MUSCLE UPS EVENT AND 19TH IN THE RUN. BRETT THORNBURN: BRETTS FIRST INDIVIDUAL COMPETIITION. HE FINISHED 19TH ON THE KEG CARRY AND 22ND ON THE RUN. ALL THE INDIVIDUAL ATHLETES DID THE GYM PROUD AND I THINK WE ALL LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE OUR FITNESS IS AT AND WHAT WE NEED TO WORK ON. TEAM COMPETITION ON SUNDAY: TEAMS WERE MADE UP OF 1 MALE AND 1 FEMALE. THE WORKOUTS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THE INDIVIDUAL EVENT HELD ON SATURDAY AND 4 OF US DID BOTH DAYS. HICKS AND HARRISON: GILL AND I FINISHED 4TH OUT OF THE 40 TEAMS COMPETING. IT INCLUDED A FIRST PLACE ON THE RUN EVENT AND A 3RD PLACE ON THE MUSCLE UPS. IT ALSO MUST BE SAID THAT IF I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO PUT TWO FEET ON THE FINISH MAT AFTER MY LAST KEG CARRY WE WOULD HAVE FINISHED THE WEEKEND IN 3RD PLACE. WOOPS. JAME AND ODLUND: COACH JOHN AND HIS LOVELY GIRLFRIEND CAMILA PARTNERED UP AND DID AWESOME WITH AN 11TH PLACE FINISH OVERALL. IT WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A 3RD PLACE FINISH IN THE KEG CARRY AND 11TH PLACE ON THE MUSCLE UPS. CROSS AND SWANSON: STEPH AND MIKE CAME IN IN 18TH PLACE OVERALL.

A COUPLE HICKUPS ALL AROUND (INCLUDING SOME OUT OF OUR CONTROL) BUT OVERALL A VERY ENJOYABLE TIME NO DOUBT. THE CASCADE CLASSIC, THE LARGEST EVENT IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, IS NEXT UP FOR CROSSFIT LIONS. ITS ON THANKSGIVING WEEKEND AND SCOTT AND ANNIE HAVE BOTH QUALIFIED TO COMPETE. THERE WILL BE A CREW OF US HEADING DOWN FOR THE WEEKEND AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US LET ME KNOW. TONS OF TOP CROSSFIT GAMES ATHLETES WILL BE THROWING DOWN.
61	CLAUDE GIROUX, LEFT, AND WAYNE SIMMONDS FOUND THE FIRST DAY OF TRAINING CAMP TO BE MUCH HIGHER TEMPO THAN NORMAL.  WE HAVE TO BELIEVE AND TRUST IN THE WORK WE'VE PUT IN TO GET TO THIS POINT. (PHOTO: ZACK HILL/PHILADELPHIA FLYERS) VOORHEES WHEN A REPETITION OF A DRILL WAS DONE, MOST PLAYERS GLIDED TO THE BLUELINE TO REST, HUNCHED OVER AND PROPPING THEMSELVES UP WITH THEIR STICKS OVER THEIR KNEES. THOSE FEW SECONDS WERE THE ONLY RELIEF ON THE ICE DURING THE FLYERS OPENING PRACTICE OF TRAINING CAMP.  KEEPING IT LIGHT IN DEVELOPING THE IOS APP, WE SPECIFIED A FAMILY OF COLORS, BUTTON STYLES, TYPOGRAPHY AND PERSONAS TO BE APPLIED ACROSS ISSUU. IT LOOKS LIKE ROOKIE COACH DAVE HAKSTOL WILL HAVE THE FLYERS MOVING A MILE A MINUTE IN PRACTICE, ALTHOUGH HE SAID THE CADENCE WASNT ALL BASED OFF OF HIS WHISTLE. THATS THE PLAYERS, HAKSTOL SAID. OUR WHOLE STAFF SENSED THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, GUYS COMING INTO TOWN, CHOMPING AT THE BIT. REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING OUT AND WORKING TOGETHER AND WORKS HARD TOGETHER AND THATS WHAT THEY DID TODAY. HAKSTOL COMES TO THE FLYERS AFTER 11 YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA. THATS A NORMAL PACE FOR AN NCAA PRACTICE. OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY PRODUCT R.J. UMBERGER HAD BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE. THERE WERE DEFINITELY SOME ASPECTS TO IT THE BATTLING, THE ONE HARD LAP AFTER A WHISTLE OR A DRILL, THE UP-AND-DOWN KIND OF A TEMPO, UMBERGER SAID. THATS A STANDARD, EARLY IN THE WEEK PRACTICE AFTER A DAY OFF OR WHATEVER TO GET THE TEMPO BACK INTO IT. IM SURE THAT HAS A BIG INFLUENCE AND AS THE SEASON GOES ON AND AS WE GO PRACTICES WILL BE A LOT DIFFERENT. WERE GOING TO BE TECHNICAL AND STUFF LIKE THAT. HAKSTOL SAID THE TEMPO OF FRIDAYS OPENING PRACTICE IS THE EXPECTATION MOVING FORWARD. THAT OPENED SOME EYES FOR SOME OF THE PLAYERS WHO WERENT USED TO THINGS MOVING SO QUICKLY.  IT WAS GREAT TO GET BACK OUT THERE. UNDER COACH WE GOT OUR FIRST PRACTICE IN AND I THOUGHT EVERYONE WAS EXCITED. THE PRACTICE WENT REALLY WELL. THE FIRST SESSION WAS ALL VETERANS AND PLAYERS THAT HAVE THE BEST SHOT OF MAKING THE ROSTER ON OCT. 8 WHEN THE REGULAR SEASON BEGINS. THE SECOND SESSION WAS A LITTLE MORE SUBDUED, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE PLAYERS ALSO TOOK PART IN ROOKIE CAMP MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THAT PRACTICE ENDED IN A FULL SCRIMMAGE. IN TERMS OF THE LINE COMBINATIONS, IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT THE FLYERS STARTED WITH FRIDAY IS SOMETHING THEYLL CONTINUE TO EXPERIMENT WITH AND IT LOOKED QUITE SIMILAR TO LAST SEASON. MICHAEL RAFFL, CLAUDE GIROUX AND JAKE VORACEK ANCHORED THE TOP LINE. MATT READ, SEAN COUTURIER AND WAYNE SIMMONDS WERE ANOTHER FAMILIAR TRIO, AS WERE CHRIS VANDEVELDE, PIERRE-EDOUARD BELLEMARE AND RYAN WHITE. UMBERGER PLAYED THE LEFT SIDE ON A LINE WITH VINNY LECAVALIER BACK AT CENTER (HE PLAYED MOSTLY RIGHT WING LAST SEASON) AND NEWCOMER SAM GAGNER.  WE JUST PUT THE LINES TOGETHER THE WAY WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE FOR SUCCESS, HAKSTOL SAID. I DONT THINK THERE WAS ANY EXTRA THOUGHT GOING INTO IT IN THAT REGARD. WE PUT GROUPS TOGETHER. WERE LOOKING FOR FOUR GROUPS OF FORWARDS THAT CAN HELP US WIN GAMES. THATS THE AIM FOR ALL OF IT: THE HIGH PACE, THE NEW COACH, NEW PLAYERS AND THE FAST-PACED START TO TRAINING CAMP. TWICE IN THE LAST THREE SEASONS THE FLYERS HAVE MISSED THE PLAYOFFS AND THEY THINK THATS MORE A PRODUCT OF UNDERACHIEVEMENT THAN LACK OF TALENT. I ENDED UP READING AN ARTICLE AND SEEING HOW WERE DOWN IN THE STANDINGS, CAPTAIN CLAUDE GIROUX SAID. IT KINDA PISSES ME OFF A LITTLE BIT AND PUT SOME MOTIVATION IN US. WE THINK WERE A PLAYOFF TEAM. THERES ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT AND THATS TO BE IN THE PLAYOFFS. BEFORE THEY CAN REACH THE PLAYOFFS, LET ALONE REGULAR-SEASON GAMES, THEYVE GOT TO GET THROUGH SOME TOUGH PRACTICES.  AT THE END A COUPLE DRILLS WERE KIND OF HARD, BUT THE HARD WORK IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW SO WE WONT HAVE TO WORK AS HARD DURING GAMES. DAVE ISAAC; (856) 486-2479; DISAAC@GANNETTNJ.COM .

62	ON AUG 31, WE ISSUED AN UPDATED RESEARCH REPORT ON PAINTS AND COATINGS MAKER VALSPAR ( VAL - ANALYST REPORT ). VALSPAR SAW HIGHER PROFITS IN THIRD-QUARTER FISCAL 2015 (ENDED JUL 31, 2015) ON THE BACK OF SOLID COMMERCIAL EXECUTION AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER SURPASSED THE ZACKS CONSENSUS ESTIMATE WHILE REVENUES LAGGED THE SAME. THE COMPANY RAISED THE LOWER END OF ITS EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2015. VALSPAR HAS A BROAD PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHARE GAINS IN BOTH ITS PAINTS AND COATINGS SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY SHOULD CONTINUE TO GAIN FROM NEW BUSINESS WINS, INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH INITIATIVES AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. WINNING NEW BUSINESSES REMAIN A COMPANY-WIDE FOCUS THAT WILL POSITION VALSPAR WELL FOR THE FUTURE. THE ACQUISITION OF PAINT MANUFACTURING ASSETS OF ACE HARDWARE HAS REINFORCED VALSPAR RETAIL FOOTHOLD IN THE U.S. MOREOVER, VALSPAR HAS STRENGTHENED ITS POSITION IN THE $6 BILLION EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MARKET WITH THE TAKEOVER OF ITALY-BASED INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MAKER INVER HOLDING S.R.L. THE PURCHASE OF QUEST SPECIALTY CHEMICALS PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESSES HAS ALSO STRENGTHENS VALSPAR'S FOOTHOLD IN THE ATTRACTIVE AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH MARKET. THE COMPANY IS LOOKING TO BOOST SALES WITH THE INTEGRATION OF QUEST CHEMICALS. THE ACQUISITION ADDED 6% TO PAINTS SEGMENTS SALES IN THE THIRD QUARTER. IN ADDITION, VALSPARS PAINT BUSINESS IS ALSO BENEFITING FROM CONTINUED ROLLOUT OF VALSPAR BRANDED PRODUCTS AT ACE HARDWARE. MOREOVER, VALSPAR RESERVE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR PAINTS ARE ALSO DRIVING SALES IN THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CHANNEL. VALSPAR IS AGGRESSIVELY INVESTING IN PROMOTING THIS PRODUCT. VALSPAR IS ALSO MANAGING ITS COST WELL AND MAINTAINING A COST STRUCTURE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CURRENT EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. IT ALSO REMAINS COMMITTED TO BOOST SHAREHOLDER RETURN LEVERAGING HEALTHY CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, VALSPAR FACES CURRENCY HEADWINDS, STEMMING FROM A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR. UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY SWINGS REDUCED ITS SALES BY 5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER. CURRENCY HEADWIND IS EXPECTED WEIGH ON ITS SALES FOR FISCAL 2015. THE COMPANY NOW SEES ITS REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2015 TO FALL IN THE MID SINGLE-DIGITS YEAR OVER YEAR VERSUS A LOW SINGLE-DIGITS DECLINE EXPECTED EARLIER. WE ALSO ACCOUNT FOR VOLATILITY IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS. VALSPAR HAS EXPERIENCED DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLIES OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT VARIOUS TIMES, IMPACTING ITS ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS. THE OVERALL DEMAND ENVIRONMENT ALSO REMAINS UNEVEN. VALSPAR CURRENTLY SPORTS A ZACKS RANK #3 (HOLD). OTHER STOCKS TO CONSIDER OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BASIC MATERIALS SPACE WORTH CONSIDERING INCLUDE INNOSPEC INC. ( IOSP - SNAPSHOT REPORT ), AIR PRODUCTS & CHEMICALS INC. ( APD - ANALYST REPORT ) AND LYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V. ( LYB - ANALYST REPORT ).

63	NEW DELHI: MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS AND PLATFORM TICKETS WILL SOON GO PAPERLESS AS RAILWAYS IS PLANNING TO LAUNCH A MOBILE-BASED APPLICATION FOR THE SAME SHORTLY. PAPERLESS MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS AND PLATFORM TICKETS IN CITIES LIKE MUMBAI, DELHI, CHENNAI AND KOLKATA ARE TO BE LAUNCHED IN NEXT FEW DAYS, RAILWAY MINISTER SURESH PRABHU HERE TODAY SAID WHILE LAUNCHING THE PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING SYSTEM FOR DELHI-PALWAL SUBURBAN SECTION HERE. PRABHU ALSO LAUNCHED TWO OTHER IT-BASED INITIATIVES - CASH/SMART CARD-OPERATED TICKET-VENDING MACHINE AT THE NEW DELHI RAILWAY STATION AND A MOBILE APP FOR FREIGHT OPERATION MONITORING NAMED AS 'PARICHAALAN'. "THERE ARE ABOUT 75 LAKH PASSENGERS WHO USE MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS IN MUMBAI OUT OF OUR TOTAL 2.3 CRORE DAILY PASSENGERS," PRABHU SAID, ADDING, "SIMILARLY A GOOD NUMBER OF PASSENGERS TRAVEL ON MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS IN CHENNAI, KOLKATA AND DELHI ALSO." HE SAID THE MOVE TO GO PAPERLESS IS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S 'DIGITAL INDIA' INITIATIVE WHICH NOT ONLY SAVES THE USE OF PAPER BUT ALSO REDUCES THE LOAD ON BOOKING COUNTER. THE IT-BASED MOBILE APPLICATION FOR TICKETS WILL MAKE PAPER MANUFACTURERS UNHAPPY BUT PASSENGERS HAPPY AS IT WILL SAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR THEM, HE SAID. THE PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING SYTEM IN DELHI-PALWAL SECTION COVERS 11 STATIONS OVER 57 KM OF DISTANCE. THE APP, WHICH IS FOR BOTH ANDROID AND WINDOWS-BASED PLATFORMS, CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE OR WINDOWS STORE BY THE USER. THE APPLICATION PROVIDES NECESSARY ON-SCREEN ALERTS TO GUIDE THE PASSENGER DURING THE BOOKING PROCESS. PAYMENT FOR THE TICKET IS DONE THROUGH THE "RAILWAY WALLET" FEATURE IN THE APP. AFTER BOOKING THE TICKET, THE PASSENGER WILL GET TICKET CONFIRMATION SCREEN, WHICH WILL CONTAIN LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT THE TICKET. EARLIER, THE MOBILE APP FOR PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED BETWEEN EGMORE AND TAMBRAM SUBURBAN SECTIONS IN CHENNAI UNDER SOUTHERN RAILWAY ZONE ON A TRIAL BASIS IN APRIL. THEN IT WAS REPLICATED IN WESTERN RAILWAYS BETWEEN CHURCHGATE AND DAHANU SECTION. DEVELOPED BY THE CENTRE FOR RAILWAY INFORMATION SYSTEMS (CRIS) "UTSONMOBILE" - THE PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING FEATURE IN MOBILE APPLICATION AIMS TO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR PRINTING OF UNRESERVED TICKETS. PRABHU SAID RAILWAYS WILL SIGN AN AGREEMENT WITH ISRO FOR USING GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGY AND SATELLITE IMAGES IN THE RAIL SECTOR. AS PER PLAN, RAILWAYS WILL USE REMOTE-SENSING TECHNOLOGY AT UNMANNED LEVEL CROSSINGS TO WARN ROAD USERS AND ALSO FOR OTHER USAGE SUCH AS MAPPING OF STATIONS AND RAIL ROUTES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ISRO. HE SAID CASH/SMART CARD OPERATED TICKET-VENDING MACHINE (COTVM) WHICH WAS MADE OPERATIONAL AT THE NEW DELHI STATION WILL BE INSTALLED AT OTHER STATIONS ALSO. COTVM IS AN UNMANNED SELF-OPERATED KIOSK WHICH CAN BE USED BY PASSENGERS THEMSELVES TO BUY UNRESERVED TICKETS THROUGH CURRENCY/COINS AS WELL AS SMART CARDS. THESE KIOSKS HAVE EASY GRAPHICAL INTERFACE FOR TICKET TRANSACTION SO THAT THE USER CAN OPERATE THESE MACHINES. THE KIOSK ACCEPTS CURRENCY/COIN OF ALL DENOMINATIONS OF RS 5 AND ABOVE. THE MACHINE DOES NOT ACCEPT SOILED/CUT/GLUED/TAPED/COLORED NOTES AND ACCEPTS CURRENCY NOTES OF GANDHI SERIES. COTVMS AIMS TO REDUCE QUEUE LENGTH AT EXISTING TICKET COUNTERS BY PROVIDING AN ALTERNATE UNMANNED TICKETING SOLUTION AND MODE OF PAYMENT. PRABHU SAID BOTH PASSENGER AND FREIGHT BUSINESS ARE IMPORTANT FOR RAILWAYS AND THE 'PARICHAALAN' MOBILE APP FOR FREIGHT OPERATORS WILL HELP IN REAL-TIME DECISION-MAKING. 'PARICHAALAN', A USER-FRIENDLY APP, REPRESENTS DATA IN A PICTORIAL AND GRAPHICAL MANNER THAT IS EASILY COMPREHENSIBLE AND ALSO MAKES THE INFORMATION DYNAMIC AND CURRENT IN NATURE IN THE FREIGHT SECTOR.
64	COMMENTS(0) CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION VENUES THAT COMBINE STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITIES WITH STUNNING SURROUNDING SCENERY ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. NEIGHBOURING GLOUCESTERSHIRE THERE IS JUST SUCH A SITE, WHERE THE 21ST CENTURY BLENDS SEAMLESSLY WITH GROUNDS STEEPED IN TRADITION AS A PLACE WHERE EVENTS HAVE BEEN STAGED AND PEOPLE HAVE MET TO DO BUSINESS FOR DECADES. THE THREE COUNTIES SHOWGROUND AT MALVERN HAS COME A LONG WAY OVER THOSE DECADES, DEVELOPING SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS TO MEET CONTEMPORARY DEMAND FOR BUSINESS EVENTS. THE STRIKING THREE COUNTIES CENTRE, PURPOSE BUILT FOR CONFERENCES AND EXHIBITIONS, OPENED ONLY IN 2011, IS A VERSATILE VENUE, THAT CAN HOST EVENTS ATTRACTING FROM 2,000 TO TENS OF PEOPLE, DEPENDING ON WHAT ORGANISERS REQUIRE. THE DESCRIPTION OF ITS SPACE AS "A BLANK CANVAS" IS APT, AS IT CAN BE CUSTOMISED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TO STAGE ANYTHING FROM SMALL CONFERENCES TO FUNDRAISING BALLS, TRADE SHOWS, PHOTO SHOOTS, FASHION SHOWS AND LARGE VEHICLE EXHIBITIONS. THE LARGEST SPACE, ON THE GROUND FLOOR, SEVERN HALL, CAN ACCOMMODATE EXHIBITIONS, BUSINESS EXPOS AND LARGE CONFERENCES. THE LINDEN SUITE, CONNECTED TO SEVERN HALL, CAN BE USED AS A BREAKOUT AREA FOR SEVERN HALL OR HIRED INDEPENDENTLY. CONNECTED, IN TURN, TO THE LINDEN SUITE IS THE LEADON SUITE, SUITABLE FOR BOARD MEETINGS OR SEMINARS. CONFERENCE DELEGATES AND EXHIBITION VISITORS ENJOY PANORAMIC VIEWS OF THE MALVERN HILLS - AN AREA OF OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY - FROM THE FIRST FLOOR PERRY SUITE, WHICH HOSTS CONFERENCES, BUSINESS BREAKFASTS AND EVEN WEDDINGS. FREE WI-FI IS AVAILABLE ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE SHOWGROUND TO KEEP PEOPLE IN TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER ON OR OFF SITE. GLOUCESTERSHIRE'S KEY ROLE IN THE ROYAL THREE COUNTIES SHOW IS LONGSTANDING AND THE COUNTY'S CONNECTIONS DO NOT END THERE. THE ROYAL WAS ADDED TO THE SHOW'S TITLE IN 2013, THE YEAR THE GLOUCESTERSHIRE-BASED PRINCESS ROYAL BECAME THE SHOW'S PATRON. SHE HAS BEEN A FREQUENT VISITOR OVER THE YEARS. THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE THREE COUNTIES AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY, KEN NOTTAGE, WAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF GLOUCESTER RUGBY IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TAKING UP HIS CURRENT POST. ALL OF THOSE ASSOCIATIONS POINT TO A CLOSE AFFINITY BETWEEN GLOUCESTERSHIRE AND THE THREE COUNTIES SHOWGROUND, WHICH IS UNDERLINED BY THEIR PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER. THE SHOWGROUND IS ONLY AROUND HALF AN HOUR FROM CHELTENHAM AND IT IS WITHIN EASY REACH OF A VARIETY OF STARTING DESTINATIONS. ITS CENTRAL LOCATION MEANS IT IS 15 MINUTES FROM THE M5'S JUNCTIONS 7 AND 8 AND THE M50'S JUNCTION 1. IT IS ONLY A FIVE-MINUTE DRIVE FROM GREAT MALVERN STATION, WHICH HAS DIRECT TRAINS TO AND FROM LONDON PADDINGTON (THREE HOURS) AND BIRMINGHAM NEW STREET (ONE HOUR). A SHUTTLE BUS IS AVAILABLE FROM THE STATION ON REQUEST. BIRMINGHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IS JUST 50 MINUTES AWAY AND BRISTOL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 90 MINUTES. FOR ANYONE DRIVING TO AN EVENT AT THE SHOWGROUND THERE IS THE ADDED BONUS OF FREE PARKING. THAT ALL MAKES THE THREE COUNTIES CENTRE A GOOD CHOICE FOR GLOUCESTERSHIRE BUSINESSES LOOKING FOR A DISTINCTIVE, NEARBY VENUE TO STAGE EVENTS. ONE, STAVERTON-BASED CREED FOODSERVICE, HAS SELECTED IT FOR ITS CREED FOODSERVICE TRADE SHOW. ONE OF THE ATTRACTIONS OF THE SHOWGROUND FOR CREED WAS ITS HISTORY IN AGRICULTURE AND FOOD BUT, IN THE WORDS OF CREED FOODSERVICE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, CHRIS CREED: "IT'S NOT THAT FAR". "THIS IS A REALLY SPECIAL SPACE AND WHILST WE ARE LOCATED IN AN AREA OF OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY, SOME SERIOUS BUSINESS IS DONE HERE. "PERHAPS, HOWEVER, SOME PEOPLE DO NOT REALISE THE EXTENT OF OUR FACILITIES AND THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE FOR HIRE YEAR ROUND. "WE WOULD WELCOME YOU TO GET IN TOUCH AND COME FOR A TOUR." KEN NOTTAGE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, THREE COUNTIES AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY "WE CHOSE THE THREE COUNTIES FOR THE CREED ANNUAL TRADE SHOW 2015 BECAUSE THE FACILITIES WERE JUST WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF EXHIBITION SPACE, AVAILABILITY OF AN INDUSTRIAL KITCHEN AND EASE OF ACCESS. "THE THREE COUNTIES TEAM HAVE BEEN FRIENDLY AND PROFESSIONAL AND ALL IN ALL IT'S A GREAT SETTING". CHRIS CREED, CEO, CREED FOODSERVICE "I'VE BEEN TO A NUMBER OF EVENTS AT THREE COUNTIES AND WAS A SPEAKER AT THE THREE COUNTIES BIG BREAKFAST, WHICH WAS PACKED WITH LOCAL BUSINESS PEOPLE. "IT'S A VERSATILE VENUE THAT IS WITHIN EASY STRIKING DISTANCE OF CHELTENHAM AND, OF COURSE, THE SETTING WITH THE VIEWS OF THE MALVERN HILLS IS UNPARALLELED." JANE FURZE, DIRECTOR, CHELTENHAM LITERATURE FESTIVAL "WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON OUR HIGH LEVELS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. "WHETHER YOU HAVE BOOKED A SMALL CONFERENCE FOR 30 PEOPLE OR A LARGE EXHIBITION FOR 2,000, YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND OUR EVENTS TEAM TO BE PROFESSIONAL, FRIENDLY AND HAPPY TO HELP. "I PERSONALLY HAVE 10 YEARS' EXPERIENCE IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY LOCALLY SO I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY CLIENT HAS DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND I ENJOY TAILOR MAKING PACKAGES TO SUIT." CLAIRE JARRETT, VENUE HIRE CO-ORDINATOR, THREE COUNTIES
65	EACH DAY WE SEE THE EFFORT OF UNIONS TO FORCE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY FARM WORKERS TO PAY BRIBES TO WORK. THEN YOU HAVE THE EFFORT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES ARE FORCING WORKERS TO SPEND MORE ON WORKING CONDITIONS. THEN YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR FARMS, ESPECIALLY IF A NEW PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. THE SOLUTION IS ROBOTS AND MACHINES TO DO THE PICKING AND HARVESTING OF CROPS. WHILE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE NEW MACHINES, THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SO. YEARS AGO UC DAVIS DEVELOPED A TOMATO PICKING MACHINEBUT THE UNIONS STOPPED ITS DEVELOPMENT. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. AGAIN, AMERICA CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN AGRICULTURE INTERNATIONALLY. WE CAN INNOVATE AND FEED THE HUNGRY MASSES BY MAKING FOOD AVAILABILITY MORE RELIABLE AND LOW COST. 4 LABOR-INTENSIVE CROPS FARMERS WISH THEY HAD ROBOTS TO HARVEST ELIZA BARCLAY, KPBS, 9/7/15 THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION SAYS MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO PICK HOT AND BELL PEPPERS COULD HELP SOLVE LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEMS. IF YOURE ENJOYING A LATE-SUMMER FRUIT PIE THIS LABOR DAY, CONSIDER WHAT WENT INTO GROWING AND HARVESTING THAT FRUIT. CHANCES ARE, IT TOOK A LOT OF HUMAN HANDS TO ENSURE ITS SKIN WOULD BE PERFECT AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. WHILE MACHINES HAVE REPLACED HUMAN HANDS FOR A LOT OF FARM JOBS THE HARVESTING OF TOMATOES FOR PROCESSING, THE CUTTING OF LETTUCE AND SPINACH, THE SHAKING OF ALMOND TREES TO MAKE THE NUTS FALL TO THE GROUND MANY FRUIT, VEGETABLE AND NUT FARMERS STILL RELY HEAVILY ON PEOPLE TO PLANT, MAINTAIN AND HARVEST THEIR CROPS. MACHINES DONT YET EXIST FOR THESE CROPS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN AMPLE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK, AND BECAUSE ITS HARD TO DESIGN MACHINES THAT CAN CUT OR PICK THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLES WITHOUT SQUISHING OR DAMAGING THEM TOO MUCH. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. ALL THATS CREATED A NEW PUSH FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO MECHANIZATION TO REPLACE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME FILLING. THERES AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF FRESH-MARKET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS, MATTHEW WHITING , AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND EXTENSION SPECIALIST AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEET CHERRY INDUSTRY, TELLS THE SALT. THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED HARVEST LABOR IS ON EVERY GROWERS MIND. FOR LABOR DAY, WE THOUGHT WED ROUND UP SOME OF THE CROPS THAT CANT YET BE HARVESTED BY A MACHINE, BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE FUTURE. TO BE CLEAR, THE ISSUE OF FARM LABOR IS COMPLICATED. AND MACHINES THAT COULD HARVEST THESE CROPS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE. SWEET CHERRIES THESE ARE THE SOFT, SWEET CHERRIES WE GET IN BAGS WITH THE STEM ATTACHED. AND WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND PLUMP? BECAUSE A HUMAN HAND CAREFULLY PICKED THEM. BUT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER WILLING HANDS TO DO THAT WORK. AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTICED. OF ALL THE PRODUCERS THAT DREAM OF MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO EASE THEIR LABOR WOES, THE SWEET CHERRY GROWERS MIGHT BE THE CLOSEST TO GETTING ONE THANKS TO RESEARCH FUNDING. MATT WHITING SAYS HE AND OTHERS AT WSU ARE CLOSE TO FINDING A COMMERCIAL PARTNER FOR A PROTOTYPE HARVESTER THAT CAN PICK 50 TIMES AS MANY CHERRIES AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD IN THE SAME TIME. STILL, THERES ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS NEW MODEL IS VIABLE: NEW VARIETIES OF CHERRIES SUITED TO THE MECHANICAL HARVESTER WILL NEED TO BE BRED. WHITING SAYS RESEARCH IS HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT IN 10 TO 12 YEARS, SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER GROWERS A SUITE OF NEW VARIETIES. ASPARAGUS AS THE HUFFINGTON POST HAS REPORTED , ASPARAGUS IS UNIQUELY LABOR INTENSIVE BECAUSE THE QUICK-GROWING PLANT MUST BE HARVESTED EVERY DAY OF ITS THREE-MONTH GROWING SEASON. EACH PLANT SPROUTS MULTIPLE SPEARS (THE PART OF THE PLANT WE EAT) A DAY, WHICH HAVE TO BE HAND-CUT EVERY DAY. SO THAT MEANS WORKERS ARE CUTTING 14 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FROM ROUGHLY FEBRUARY TO MAY. BUT VARIOUS MECHANICAL ASPARAGUS HARVESTERS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING THEM. ACCORDING TO A 2009 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT , IF THE U.S. ASPARAGUS INDUSTRY IS TO INSURE A COMPETITIVE POSITION, IT MUST SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGY FOR LABOR TO LOWER PER UNIT COSTS AND SHIFT THE WORKFORCE TO VALUE-ADDED EMPLOYMENT. INSTITUTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW. APPLES COMMERCIAL APPLE PICKING TODAY REQUIRES BRAWN WORKERS HAVE TO FILL BUCKETS ALL DAY LONG WITH HEAVY APPLES AND THEN DUMP THEM INTO BINS. AND ACCORDING TO A FRUIT INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION , THE ERA OF FULLY AUTOMATED ROBOTIC HARVESTERS NAVIGATING [APPLE] ORCHARD ROWS IS STILL YEARS AWAY. WHITING SAYS THATS BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS DEDICATED LITTLE FUNDING DEDICATED TO RESEARCH. THATS CHANGING, THOUGH. THE WASHINGTON STATE TREE FRUIT RESEARCH COMMISSION IS NOW PURSUING MORE RESEARCH ON MECHANICAL HARVESTING. AND THIS YEAR, SOME COMMERCIAL APPLE FARMERS MAY BE USING A VACUUM HARVESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME. ITS DESIGNERS SAY IT SAVES TIME, REDUCES PICKER FATIGUE AND BOOST THE HARVEST YIELD. PEPPERS CALIFORNIA GROWS ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE PEPPERS IN THE U.S., AND LATELY THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION HAS BEEN TALKING MORE DEVELOPING MECHANICAL HARVESTING AND VARIETIES BRED TO BE PICKED BY MACHINES. ACCORDING TO A 2015 REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION, WITH INCREASING COST AND DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF LABOR NEEDED TO PICK PEPPERS, INNOVATION [SIMILAR TO THE PROCESSED TOMATO INDUSTRY] COULD GIVE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. FARMERS SIGNIFICANT RETURNS AND POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PEPPER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA, THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO HAVE FRESH MARKET QUALITY AND MECHANICAL HARVESTING IN BOTH BLOCKY [BELL PEPPERS] AND HOT TYPES.

66	FINALLY, THE CONFESSION WE HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. DIFFICULT THOUGH IT IS TO IGNORE THE STRETCHING OF CREDIBILITY IN THESE EPISODES, ILL DO MY BEST. ROBERT URGES TRACY TO TELL THE TRUTH - TO CONFESS TO CARLA THAT IT WAS HER WHO STARTED THE FIRE. ITS NOT EASY WATCHING HER TORTURE HERSELF OVER SOMETHING YOU DID. THIS OF COURSE BEGS THE QUESTION, WHY IS HE SO BOTHERED? IS IT BECAUSE HE IS JUST ON THE SIDE OF JUSTICE OR IS IT BECAUSE HE THINKS TRACY WILL FEEL BETTER FOR CONFESSING? HE TELLS TRACY THAT SHE SHOULD CONFESS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, OR ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE TO. ROY SPOTS CARLA DRINKING AND LOOKING AT MADDIES MEMORIAL. ROY ASKS, DO YOU THINK DRINKING IS A GOOD IDEA? HER REPLY ALWAYS. CARLA IS DRINKING, AGAIN, THIS TIME IN HER CAR, AND TRACY GETS IN AND SITS BESIDE HER. ALL THIS MOPING ABOUT, THIS WEIRD CRAWLING AROUND LIKE SOME MESSENGER OF DOOM. ITS BORDERLINE SELF INDULGENT, ITS NOT A GOOD LOOK. TRACY PLEADS WITH CARLA, TELLING HER TO STOP BLAMING HERSELF FOR THE DEATHS OF KAL AND MADDIE. SHE TELLS HER THE FIRE WAS AN ACCIDENT. WITH NO WARNING, CARLA HEADS OFF IN HER CAR WITH TRACY AS HER PASSENGER. BUCKLE UP BARLOW, WERE IN FOR A GOOD RIDE. GOODNESS ONLY KNOWS WHAT THE ALCOHOL LEVEL IN CARLS BLOOD MUST BE BY NOW. IT SEEMS SHE HAS BEEN DRINKING NON-STOP FOR WEEKS. TRACY IS CONCERNED THAT CARLAS DRIVING HEAVILY UNDER THE INFLUENCE, BUT CARLA YELLS AT HER, CHILL OUT TRACY, WERE NOT GOING TO CRASH. IVE KILLED ENOUGH PEOPLE FOR ONE LIFETIME. THE 2 WOMEN ARRIVE AT A QUARRY AND CLAMBER UP TO THE EDGE. THIS IS THE PLACE, SHE REVEALS WHERE SHE USED TO PLAY WITH HER BROTHER ROB AND THEIR MATES. SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS ARE CLEARLY AT THE FOREFRONT OF CARLAS MIND. TRACY TELLS HER IT WONT CHANGE ANYTHING IF SHE JUMPS. ITS JUST FATE, SHE SAYS. CARLA CARRIES THE FATE IDEA ON. FATE, YES, RED OR BLACK, HEADS OR TAILS, ITS JUST THE WAY THINGS FALL. HEADS I STAND, TAILS I FALL, SAYS CARLA. IT SEEMS AS IF CARLA IS JUST ABOUT TO GO OVER THE EDGE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE IS A SCREAM OF CARLA! WAIT! I DID IT! CARLA ASKS TRACY WHY SHE BOTHERED TO SAVE HER LIFE WHEN THE BUS CRASHED. SHE ADDS THAT IF TRACY HADNT SAVED HER, KAL AND MADDIE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE. TRACY REVEALS ALL. UNDERSTANDABLY CARLA IS VERY SHOCKED. THE 2 WOMEN ENGAGE IN A TUSSLE. EVENTUALLY THEY ARRIVE BACK ON THE COBBLES AND TRACY HAS TOLD EVERYTHING. HOW SHE STOLE MICHELLES KEYS TO GET INTO CARLAS FLAT AND HOW SHE WANTED CARLAS LIFE TO END, SEEING HER AS THE CAUSE OF ALL HER MISERY, INCLUDING ROBS GOING TO PRISON AND CARLA BUYING THE SHARE OF THE PUB THAT SHE, TRACY, HAD WANTED WITH TONY. TRACY CONFESSES THAT SHE WANTED TO MAKE CARLA PAY. IT SEEMED THAT CARLA HAD EVERYTHING AND THAT SHE, TRACY HAD NOTHING LEFT. AN EXTREMELY (UNDERSTANDABLY) UNFORGIVING CARLA TELLS TRACY, MY STAFF DESPISE ME, MY FRIENDS FEEL SORRY FOR ME, MY BUSINESS IS ON ITS KNEES. IVE THROWN IT ALL AWAY -ALL FOR TAKING THE RAP FOR YOU! ZEEDAN IS PLAYING A BLINDER! WHAT A RESPONSIBLE, THOUGHTFUL AND CONCERNED YOUNG MAN HE HAS BECOME. THE RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN LEANNE AND ZEEDAN IS THOROUGHLY PLAUSIBLE AND A JOY TO SEE. STILL GRIEVING FOR HIS DAD OF COURSE, HE DOES WHAT HIS DAD WOULD HAVE WANTED HIM TO DO AND THAT IS TO LOOK OUT FOR LEANNE. PRAISE TOO TO THE SHARIF FAMILY, AS A WHOLE, FOR WELCOMING LEANNE INTO THEIR FAMILY. LEANNE HAS ALREADY CONFESSED THAT SHE IS FRIGHTENED OF SIMON AND THAT HER STAY IN HOSPITAL IS DUE TO SIMONS VIOLENCE TOWARDS HER. LEANNE, STILL NOT FULLY RECOVERED, ASKS ZEEDAN TO HELP HER FIND SIMON. THIS PLAYS WELL. IT IS FULLY CREDIBLE THAT YOU CAN LOVE SOMEONE DEEPLY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING AFRAID OF THEM AND ALSO BEING ANXIOUS AS TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE AGGRESSOR. AN EXTREMELY UPSET AND WORRIED LEANNE IS ON THE POINT OF REPORTING SIMONS DISAPPEARANCE TO THE POLICE, ON KENS ADVICE WHEN, AMY TELLS THEM THAT HES UPSTAIRS IN HER BEDROOM. LEANNE RUSHES UPSTAIRS TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAS BEEN HIDING IN AMYS WARDROBE, BUT WHEN AMY WAS ASKED IF SHE HAD SEEN HIM OR KNEW WHERE HE WAS, SHE LIED. WE NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOUNG AMY SIMON IS DISTRAUGHT THAT LEANNE HAS TOLD ZEEDAN, WHO SIMON LOOKS UP TO, THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HES DONE. BUT ZEEDAN COVERS FOR LEANNE AND TELLS SIMON THAT HE GUESSED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT HE IS GUTTED. YOURE NOT THE LAD I THOUGHT YOU WERE. MAYBE THAT WILL OPEN SIMONS EYES AND HE WILL REALISE HOW LUCKY HE IS TO HAVE LEANNE AS HIS MUM. ZEEDAN TELLS SIMON THAT HE HAS LOST HIS MUM AND HIS DAD AND THAT SOME DAYS HE WANTS TO PUNCH BRICK WALLS, OTHERS, HE STRUGGLES TO GET OUT OF BED. HE SAYS HE WOULD NEVER LIFT A HAND TO HIS FAMILY. YOURE A GOOD KID SI, DEEP DOWN, I KNOW YOU ARE. ZEEDANS CONCERN FOR HIS FATHERS INTENDED, EVEN EXPANDS TO HIS TURNING UP WITH HIS SLEEPING BAG AND INSISTING HE IS STAYING THE NIGHT AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT SIMON IS NO LONGER A DANGER TO LEANNE. SIMON TELLS HIM, SHE DOESNT NEED A BODY GUARD. ZEEDAN REPLIES, AND YOURE GOING TO PROVE THAT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. ADMIRABLE. UNADMIRABLE IS THE WAY IN WHICH DAVID AND KYLIE ARE PLOTTING TO GET SHUT OF GAIL. THEY REASON THAT IF LILY COULD HAVE HER OWN ROOM THEN THEIR NIGHTS MIGHT BE BETTER. GAIL TELLS SALLY THAT THEY WANT HER OUT. ON SALLYS ADVICE GAIL DECIDES TO CONSULT TONY TO SEE IF IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO CONVERT THE GARAGE INTO A GRANNY FLAT FOR HER TO LIVE IN. SALLY, AU FAIT IN ALL MATTERS MODERN, OR AT LEAST SHE THINKS SHE IS, SAYS ITS NOT FRENCH DOORS, ITS BI-FOLDS AND ALSO THAT THEY ARE THE NEW BLACK. SHE ADDS THAT AN EN SUITE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. GAIL SPEAKS OF ASSISTED LIVING AS THE DEATH OF HOPE. ANNA AND TIM DO SEEM TO BE GETTING ON VERY WELL. THEY ARE BOTH DELIGHTED THAT THEYLL SEE MILEY SOON AND LOOK AT PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER. FAYE IS ASKED TO LOOK AT THE PHOTOGRAPHS BUT JUST SAYS CUTE. SHE IS SINGING THE LONELY GOAT HERD SONG, FROM THE SOUND OF MUSIC IN WHICH SHE WILL PLAY MARIA AND IN WHICH SHE IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED.

69	SINGERS NICKI MINAJ AND MILEY CYRUS HAD A PUBLIC SPAT AT THE 2015 VMAS, HOSTED BY MILEY. DURING THE LIVE BROADCAST ON SUNDAY, NICKI CALLED MILEY A "BITCH" FOR TALKING ABOUT HER IN THE PRESS. ACCORDING TO AN INSIDER, "NICKI WAS LIVID WITH MILEY AND DECIDED TO AIR HER FEELINGS ONSTAGE." IN FACT, IT WAS REPORTED THAT MTV STAFFERS HAD TO KEEP NICKI AND MILEY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER FOR THE NIGHT TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION. IT IS HARD TO KNOW IF THEIR FIGHTING WAS STAGED OR AUTHENTIC. EITHER WAY, IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SHOUTING ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS IN PUBLIC WHEN YOU'RE UPSET IS THE BEST WAY TO GET YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS. IN NICKI'S CASE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A STRONG DESIRE TO REACH HER FAN BASE AND SHARE HER RAGE TOWARD MILEY. MAYBE SHE THOUGHT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE FACE. BUT IT REALLY ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING WITH A PARTNER IN FRONT OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS AT A HOLIDAY MEAL. SO WHEN YOU'RE IRKED AT SOMEONE, WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO LET THEM KNOW - TALK TO THEM IN PRIVATE ABOUT IT, OR LET THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW' VERY OFTEN WHEN WE ARE MAD AT SOMEONE WHO HAS HURT OUR FEELINGS OUR INCLINATION IS TO GET BACK AT THEM BY LETTING OTHERS KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO MAKE US FEEL MISTREATED AND WRONGED. IN FACT, THAT DYNAMIC IS THE HOOK OF REALITY TELEVISION. DOING THAT, THOUGH, AND BEING VOCAL ABOUT THE BAD ENERGY BETWEEN YOU MAY UNWITTINGLY PUT THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BY MAKING THEM FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE SIDES. SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET SO CAUGHT UP IN THE ANGER OF THE MOMENT THAT IT CAN SPILLOVER BEYOND THEIR PRIVATE WORLD, AS WE SAW WITH NICKI AND MILEY. BEFORE YOU LET THAT HAPPEN, ASK YOURSELF IF THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP WORTH SAVING. IF YOU DECIDE IT IS, THEN THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO GO RIGHT TO THE SOURCE AND ADDRESS THE CAUSE OF YOUR DISTRESS DIRECTLY WITH THE PERSON WHO UPSET YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE. TELL THEM WHAT THEY SAID AND DID TO SET YOU OFF, AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE AND EXPLAIN. IT WILL ALSO GIVE THE PERSON THE CHANCE TO CLEAR UP ANY MISCOMMUNICATION OR MISUNDERSTANDING THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN YOU. FIGHTING OUT IN THE OPEN JUST SERVES TO FAN THE FLAMES OF THE FURY, BUT A STRAIGHT CONVERSATION MIGHT CLEAR THE AIR AND EVEN HELP TO SALVAGE YOUR RELATIONSHIP. THIS YEAR'S VMAS WERE ALSO WITNESS TO A NUMBER OF BAD FEELINGS BEING SOOTHED, SUCH AS BETWEEN KANYE WEST AND TAYLOR SWIFT. THAT IS TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT NO MATTER HOW ANGRY SOMEONE MIGHT BE AT ONE TIME, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET OVER IT AND MOVE BEYOND IT. THE RAGE CAN DIMINISH AND YOU CAN LET IT GO. WHO KNOWS' MAYBE AT NEXT YEAR'S AWARDS SHOW WE WILL SEE A DIFFERENT EXCHANGE BETWEEN NICKI AND MILEY.PLEASE TUNE IN TO THE DOCTOR ON CALL RADIO HOUR ON HEALTHYLIFE.NET EVERY TUESDAY AT 2 PM EST, 11 AM PST.

70	BY SARAH KENT AND GEORGI KANTCHEV LONDON--EUROPE'S COMMODITIES TRADERS ARE WARNING THAT NEW REGULATIONS SET TO BE RELEASED WITHIN DAYS COULD ROIL MARKETS AND PUSH UP COSTS FOR A RANGE OF ESSENTIALS FROM CRUDE OIL TO CHOCOLATE. A FINAL DRAFT OF EXPANDED RULES GOVERNING THE EUROPEAN UNION'S OVERSIGHT OF FINANCIAL MARKETS IS EXPECTED TO EXTEND ITS AUTHORITY OVER FIRMS THAT FOCUS ON TRADING IN OIL, FARM PRODUCTS, INDUSTRIAL METALS LIKE COPPER AND A HOST OF OTHER COMMODITIES. IT WOULD ADD A NEW LAYER OF SCRUTINY FOR AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY OPERATED WITH LIMITED OVERSIGHT. THESE COMPANIES--LIKE BP PLC, GLENCORE PLC AND VITOL GROUP--BUY AND SELL HUGE VOLUMES OF OIL AND INDUSTRIAL METALS ON A DAILY BASIS, HEDGING THEIR STOCKS OF RAW MATERIALS WITH SIZABLE POSITIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY JUST HOW BIG THEY ARE, VITOL STUNNED MARKET WATCHERS IN 2008 WHEN REGULATORS DISCOVERED THAT AN INTERNAL HEDGE FUND REPRESENTED 11% OF OUTSTANDING OIL TRADES ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE. THE EU'S REGULATIONS ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF A REPEAT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND PREVENT MARKET ABUSE SUCH AS THE $2.6 BILLION LOSS IN THE COPPER MARKET ATTRIBUTED TO A TRADER AT JAPAN'S SUMITOMO IN THE 1990S. THE EU'S CURRENT RULES MOSTLY APPLY TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE BANKS AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. RIGHT NOW, BIG TRADERS LIKE GLENCORE, VITOL AND MERCURIA GROUP DON'T HAVE THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS BANKS TO SET ASIDE MONEY TO BACKSTOP THEIR TRADING AND LIMIT THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTS THEY TRADE IN A GIVEN TIME. THE NEW RULES ARE EXPECTED TO REQUIRE MORE OF THE TRADERS, THOUGH HOW MUCH REMAINS UNCLEAR. BIG COMMODITIES PLAYERS FROM ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC TO MARS CHOCOLATE TO TRAFIGURA BEHEER BV HAVE OBJECTED TO THE IDEA OF BEING TREATED ESSENTIALLY LIKE BANKS, LOBBYING BRUSSELS TO EXEMPT THEM FROM SOME OF THE RULES. THEY SAY THEY SHOULDN'T BE REGULATED AS CLOSELY BECAUSE A LARGE PART OF THEIR BUSINESS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS IS INTENDED TO LOWER THEIR RISK WHEN TRADING RAW MATERIALS. NEW RULES, THEY ARGUE, WOULD MAKE IT HARDER TO TRADE AND COULD CAUSE SOME TO LEAVE THE MARKET, MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR AIRLINES, UTILITIES AND OTHERS TO MANAGE THEIR EXPOSURE TO COMMODITIES PRICES--COSTS THAT ULTIMATELY WOULD BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS. "WE ARE UTTERLY IN FAVOR OF REGULATION, BUT WE DON'T WANT BAD OR OVER-REGULATED MARKETS THAT MAKE LIQUIDITY DRY UP," SAID GRAHAM FRANCIS, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT INTERDEALER BROKER ICAP ENERGY. "IF A BUNCH OF LIQUIDITY LEAVES, THEN WHAT? THINGS WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CONSUMERS...AND YOU'VE PROBABLY NOT IMPROVED MARKET STABILITY OR FUNCTIONALITY." THE EUROPEAN SECURITIES AND MARKETS AUTHORITY IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE TECHNICAL DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE REGULATIONS--KNOWN AS THE MARKETS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIRECTIVE, OR MIFID II--WILL BE APPLIED WITHIN DAYS. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, THE EU'S EXECUTIVE BRANCH, MUST THEN APPROVE OR REJECT THEM. REEMT SEIBEL, SPOKESMAN FOR THE SECURITIES AND MARKETS AUTHORITY, SAID THE AGENCY APPRECIATES THE CONCERNS RAISED BY BUSINESSES AND WOULD CONSIDER THEM. "IT IS NOT THE AIM OF ANY REGULATION TO KILL BUSINESS," HE SAID. TRADERS ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT WILL BE CAPTURED BY THE NEW RULES, THE VOLUMES THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TRADE AND WHETHER THEY WILL LEAVE BIG TRADERS SUBJECT TO HOLDING CAPITAL IN A SIMILAR WAY TO BANKS. "WE ARE NOT A BANK," SAID PATRICK POUYANN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FRENCH OIL GIANT TOTAL SA, WHICH HAS A LARGE TRADING ARM. HE ADDED IN A WEDNESDAY INTERVIEW: "I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED SOME REGULATIONS, BUT UP TO A POINT THAT LEAVES MARKETS TO WORK." SHELL HAS WARNED THAT IT COULD HAVE TO COMMIT UP TO $30 BILLION IN REGULATORY CAPITAL IF THE RULES ARE ENFORCED AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED. THAT COULD PROMPT THE COMPANY TO RESTRUCTURE OR MOVE PART OF ITS TRADING ARM TO A COUNTRY WITH LESS ONEROUS RULES. THE RULES ARE BEING PROPOSED AT A DIFFICULT MOMENT FOR ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TRADERS, GLENCORE. THE COMPANY HAS LOST MORE THAN 60% OF ITS STOCK VALUE THIS YEAR AS INVESTORS WORRY ABOUT ITS DEBT LEVELS AND CREDIT RATINGS AMID A COMMODITY PRICE SLUMP WITH NO END IN SIGHT. GLENCORE AND OTHERS WOULD HAVE AT LEAST 15 MONTHS TO PREPARE AND RESTRUCTURE THEIR BUSINESSES BEFORE THE RULES WENT INTO EFFECT. THE COMPANY REMAINS RELAXED ABOUT THE NEW RULES, ONE PERSON FAMILIAR WITH ITS THINKING SAID. IF NEEDED, IT COULD SIMPLY MOVE ITS TRADING OPERATIONS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. MANY OF WALL STREET'S BIGGEST FIRMS HAVE THEMSELVES DRAMATICALLY SCALED BACK THEIR COMMODITIES TRADING OR EXITED THE BUSINESS ALTOGETHER BECAUSE OF TOUGH REGULATIONS ALREADY IN PLACE. SOME OBSERVERS SAID TRADERS ARE BEING HYPERBOLIC AND THE REGULATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE BIGGEST AMERICAN OIL COMPANIES SUCH AS EXXON MOBIL CORP. AND CHEVRON CORP. HAVEN'T BEEN AS VOCAL IN OPPOSITION TO THE NEW RULES. THEY FOCUS THEIR TRADING AROUND SELLING THE CRUDE THEY PRODUCE. MAJOR EUROPEAN OIL COMPANIES HAVE LARGE TRADING ARMS THAT BUY AND SELL ADDITIONAL VOLUMES THEY DIDN'T PRODUCE. "THIS IS THE MINIMUM SET OF REQUIREMENTS THAT IS INDISPENSABLE," SAID DIEGO VALIANTE, HEAD OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS UNIT AT THE CENTRE FOR EUROPEAN POLICY STUDIES AND AN ADVISER TO ESMA. ACCORDING TO MR. VALIANTE'S CALCULATIONS, THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL EVEN THE LARGEST TRADING HOUSES WOULD NEED TO HOLD WOULD ONLY BE IN THE ORDER OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS--A LARGE, BUT AFFORDABLE FIGURE. "I DISAGREE THAT IT WILL CREATE A BIG MARKET DISRUPTION," HE SAID. THE EU'S LATEST REGULATORY PUSH WAS CONCEIVED IN THE WAKE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, AMID HEIGHTENED CONCERNS OVER SYSTEMIC RISKS IN THE MARKET AND THE ROLE SPECULATORS PLAY IN PUSHING UP PRICES FOR VITAL RAW MATERIALS LIKE OIL AND AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES.

71	ONE OF THE FEW POSITIONAL UNITS THAT PLAYED WITH MIDSEASON POLISH DURING MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL S SLOPPY LATE GAME BETWEEN THE VIKINGS AND 49ERS WAS THE SAN FRANCISCOOFFENSIVE LINE THAT PAVED THE WAY FOR CARLOS HYDE S 168 YARD, TWO-TOUCHDOWN BREAKOUT PERFORMANCE. LIKE MOST GROUPS ON THE 49ERS ROSTER, THE OFFENSIVE LINE UNDERWENT A WORLD OF CHANGE THIS OFF-SEASON. AFTER A POOR PRESEASON, MANY QUESTIONED WHETHER THIS NEW-LOOK GROUP WOULD EVER COME CLOSE TO MATCHING THE DOMINANT OFFENSIVE LINES THE 49ERS FIELDED FOR SO MUCH OF THE PAST FOUR OR FIVE SEASONS. FOR ONE WEEK, ANYHOW, THEY DID. ONE OF THE FEW CONSTANTS OF THE 49ERS' OFFENSIVE LINE, AND THE ROSTER AS A WHOLE, IS LEFT TACKLE JOE STALEY , WHO IS AMONG THE LEAGUES BEST AT HIS POSITION. STALEY, A FIRST-ROUND PICK BY SAN FRANCISCO IN 2007, HAS BEEN NAMED TO THE PRO BOWL IN EACH OF THE PAST FOUR SEASONS. HES ALSO A STALWART IN THE LOCKER ROOM, KNOWN FOR HIS UNIQUE BRAND OF LEADERSHIP AND LEVITY. NFL WEEK 2 POWER RANKINGS | FARRAR: MARIOTA'S RAPID NFL TRANSITION I CHATTED WITH STALEY THIS WEEK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF HIS NEW STARTING RUNNING BACK, THE SPECIAL QUALITIES OF JIM TOMSULAAND WHAT HE REALLY THINKS ABOUT HIS TEAMS NEW BLACK UNIFORMS. MELISSA JACOBS: CARLOS HYDE LARGELY CREDITED YOU FOR HIS MONSTER GAME . HOW GOOD IS THIS KID? JOE STALEY: HES AWESOME. HE COULD BE ONE OF THE BEST IN THE NFL. HE HAS SO MUCH TALENT AND GREAT VISION AND WHAT WERE DOING SCHEMATICALLY REALLY FITS HIS STRENGTHS. HE SAID HE FELT LIKE HE WAS BACK OUT THERE AT OHIO STATE, AND WHAT HE DID THERE IS WHY WE DRAFTED HIM. YOU ALL GOT A GLIMPSE OF WHAT WE SAW THE WHOLE OFF-SEASON. IT WASNT TOO SURPRISING FOR US BUT FOR EVERYONE ELSE, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT. MJ: YOU MENTIONED SCHEMATICS. WHAT IN [OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR] GEEP CHRYSTS PLAYBOOK IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL, AND DO YOU FORESEE MORE OF A COMMITMENT TO THE GROUND GAME THIS YEAR? JS: EVERY GAME IS ITS OWN THING. ITS NOTHING WELL DO EVERY WEEK. BUT MONDAY WAS A REAL CREDIT TO OUR DEFENSE AND GAVE US THE PATIENCE TO STICK WITH OUR GAME PLAN, WHICH WAS REALLY TO ESTABLISH THE RUN. YOU SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE GET IN TROUBLE WITH THAT DEFENSIVE FRONT. WE WERE ABLE TO STICK WITH THE RUN AND THE TEMPO SO WE DEFINITELY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE. MJ: HOW DIFFICULT WAS THE OFF-SEASON IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH VIRTUALLY EVERY MEDIA MEMBER DECIDING YOU WOULD BE TERRIBLE AND MOCKING YOUR CHOICE OF A NEW HEAD COACH? JS: I HONESTLY DONT PAY MUCH ATTENTION. BUT THATS KIND OF EXPECTED. YOU HAVE A LOT OF TURNOVER, A NEW HEAD COACH. AUTOMATICALLY EVERYONE THINKS THE SKY IS FALLING. WHAT WE WORRY ABOUT AS A TEAM ARE THE PEOPLE HERE EVERY DAY PUTTING IN THE WORK AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE HERE AND WIN GAMES. THATS THE FOCUS. MJ: OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUR OLD COACH AND YOU NEW ONE, DIFFERENCES THAT PROBABLY SPAN SEVERAL CATEGORIES. TO YOU, WHATS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JIM HARBAUGH AND JIM TOMSULA? JS: THEY BOTH HAVE A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE, AND THEYRE BOTH GREAT HEAD COACHES. I DONT WANT TO GET INTO THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF EITHER, BUT IM PLAYING FOR COACH TOMSULA RIGHT NOW. HES DONE A GREAT JOB MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE FRESH GOING INTO WEEK 1. IF YOU LOOKED AT OUR INJURY REPORT GOING INTO WEEK 1 WE ONLY HAD ONE GUY LISTED, AND HE DRESSED AND PLAYED. THATS A TRIBUTE TO HOW COACH TOMSULA APPROACHED THE OFF-SEASON, TAKING CARE OF GUYS' BODIES AND MAKING SURE THEY GOT ENOUGH REPS TO WHERE THEY WERE READY BUT GOING INTO THE SEASON FRESH.TOMSULA DOES A GREAT JOB COMMUNICATING WITH THE GUYS AND LEANING ON THE VETERANS. HES REALLY RECEPTIVE TO THE VETERAN DUDES AND TAKES A LOT OF FEEDBACK, TOO, WHICH IS NICE. NOT TO SAY THAT HARBAUGH DIDNT DO THAT ALL, BECAUSE HE DID, BUT ITS ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF JIMMY. HES A PLAYERS GUY AND HAS A LOT OF GUYS HE TRUSTS. BUT YOU HAVE TO EARN THAT TRUST. MJ: LEADING INTO THE PRESEASON THEMMQB RAN A GREAT, IN-DEPTH TOMSULA STORY THAT COVERED A LOT OF BASES. STILL, TELL US ONE THING ABOUT JIMMY T WE DONT ALREADY KNOW. JS: HIS FIRST YEAR WAS MY FIRST YEAR. HE WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST LOVED COACHES FOR THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS HERE. HE ALREADY HAS THAT RESPECT, THE ADMIRATION. HES ONE OF THE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE GUYS, ONE OF THE MOST PASSIONATE AND HE DOESNT THINK ABOUT FOOTBALL THE WAY A TYPICAL COACH DOES. HE THINKS ABOUT IT MORE AS A PLAYER. HE UNDERSTANDS THE PASSION AND EMOTION. AND HE UNDERSTANDS THE MENTAL ASPECT. MJ : IN JULY, YOU MADE AN EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE JOE SHOW , THE INTERNET SMASH WHERE YOU ASK TEAMMATES STUPID QUESTIONS IS RETURNING AFTER A TWO-YEAR HIATUS. JS: MAYBE. MJ: MAYBE? JS: I HAD TOYED WITH IT COMING BACK BUT I MAY KEEP IT ON THE SHELF FOR A WHILE. CONSIDER THIS A TEASER. I WANT TO KEEP EVERYONE ON THEIR TOES. MJ: BE HONEST. ARE YOU SHELVING YOUR SHOW BECAUSE JARRYD HAYNE IS SUCH A HARD GET THESE DAYS? JS: IM PRETTY SURE IF I HAD MY SHOW I COULD GET JARRYD. [LAUGHS.] MJ: DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO CHECK OUT THE GUARDIANS LIVE BLOG OF YOUR GAME? JS: I DID AND IT WAS HILARIOUS. I LOVED HOW HE DIDNT UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE SO MANY COMMERCIALS. MJ: OK, JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK-HIT QUESTIONS. WHO ARE THE TOP THREE LEFT TACKLES IN THE NFL? JS: JOE THOMAS AND JASON PETERS ARE THE TWO GUYS WHO REALLY COME TO MIND. ID LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS ONE OF THE TOP BUT I ALSO THINK THATS KIND OF VAIN TO TALK ABOUT YOURSELF THAT WAY. I REALLY ADMIRE THOSE GUYS AND ONE OF THE YOUNG GUYS THINK WILL BE GOOD FOR A REALLY LONG TIME IS TAYLOR LEWAN , THE LEFT TACKLE FOR THE TITANS . I LOVE WATCHING HIM ON FILM. MJ: IF YOU WERE NFL COMMISSIONER FOR A DAY, WHATS YOUR FIRST CHANGE? JS: I WOULD HIRE AN OUTSIDE DISCIPLINARY COUNCIL. MJ: ON A SCALE OF 110, HOW MUCH DO YOU MISS CANDLESTICK PARK? JS: THATS A LOADED QUESTION. ILL PASS ON THAT ONE. [LAUGHS.] MJ: THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO ANSWER MY LAST QUESTION, WHICH IS HOW WOULD YOU RANK YOUR ALTERNATIVE BLACK UNIFORMS ON A SCALE OF HIDEOUS TO RIDICULOUSLY HIDEOUS? JS: I LOVED THEM. I THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT. I DONT KNOW WHY EVERYONE WAS HATING ON THEM.

72	MY OWN NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING BLOG POST/ARTICLE: "EASIER" IS THE WORD SHE IS CONTEMPLATING HERE. DOES LOSING A CHILD OR A MUCH WANTED PREGNANCY GET EASIER? I AGREE WITH "NO". IT GETS BEARABLE. THAT IS THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE ALMOST 4 YEARS OUT. THE DEFINITION OF BEARABLE IS: ABLE TO BE ENDURED, TOLERABLE. IT DIDN'T USED TO FEEL BEARABLE. I WOULD SAY THE GRIEF BECAME BEARABLE SOMETIME BETWEEN YEAR 1 AND 2. BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALL ACTIVE GRIEF. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS I WAS UTTERLY LOST AND CONSUMED BY THE LOSS OF MICHAEL AND ALENA - HAPPINESS FELT PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE. AT 3-6 MONTHS I WAS GETTING INTO THE TERRITORY OF WANTING HAPPINESS AGAIN; OF WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HEAVIEST KIND OF GRIEF WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND I BEGAN FEELING THE NEED TO PARENT MY LOST BABIES THROUGH ACTS. FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR, I WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO HEAL AND FIND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY. GRIEF AT THIS STAGE WAS CONSUMING, BUT NOT ALL-CONSUMING. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS A "NORMAL" PERSON AT ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME. AT THIS POINT IN MY JOURNEY AS A BEREAVED MOTHER, I WOULD SAY MOST WOULD CONSIDER ME A NORMAL, HAPPY, FUNCTIONING MOTHER/WIFE/WOMAN ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. MEANING, I GET ON WITH LIFE, TRYING TO ENJOY EVERYTHING I CAN, WHILE HONORING MY BABIES AND GIVING IN TO THE GRIEF WHEN NECESSARY. THINGS ARE BEARABLE. I'LL NEVER BE AT 100% AGAIN - THERE IS TOO MUCH SCARRING. BUT I WORK EVERY DAY TO GET JUST ONE MORE PERCENT HEALED. MY SKIN IS THICKER AND FOR 11 MONTHS OF THE 12 PER YEAR, I AM SMILING AND ABLE TO GET ON WITH IT. THAT SINGLE MONTH IS VERY NEAR. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BODY...THE NEARING OF OCTOBER. I CAN FEEL THEIR BIRTHDAY APPROACHING; CAN ALMOST HEAR IT, TOUCH IT, SMELL IT. THE LEAVES BEGINNING TO TURN AND THE COOL MORNINGS ARE INDICATORS THAT THE MONTH OF MEMORIES SWIMS NEARER TO ME. I WELCOME THE MEMORIES OF THE TWO BEINGS I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING UP TILL THAT POINT, BUT ALSO SHRINK BACK IN PAIN. THIS WILL BE THE MONTH (ALSO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS), THAT I HAVE TO RELIVE MY KIDS DYING. IT'S THE MONTH I HAVE TO REMEMBER GIVING BIRTH, WHILE TEARS OF HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FALL DOWN MY FACE. IT'S FREAKING PAINFUL. BUT, IT'S BEARABLE. AND I WILL GET THROUGH IT JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, KEEP READING. I LOVED THE WAY THIS WRITER EXPRESSED LIFE AS A BEREAVED PARENT. *COPIED FROM STILL STANDING MAGAZINE* A QUESTION IM FREQUENTLY ASKED BY BEREAVED PARENTS IS, DOES ITEVERGET EASIER? THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES IS PALPABLE. I KNOW. I GET IT. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION STILL SCARES ME TOO BECAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EASIER FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT. AND IT WASNT LONG AGO THAT I WAS ASKING BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WERE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF GRIEF THAN I WAS THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. IM NOT SURE WHEN I STOPPED ASKING IT PROBABLY WHEN I REALIZED IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN. STRADDLING HEAVEN AND EARTH ISNT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE ASEASY. EASIERIS A TRICKY WORD WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING AS PERMANENTLY HORRIFIC AS CHILD LOSS. I LIKE TO RESERVE THE WORDEASIERFOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING A NEW SKILL OVER TIME. EASIER IS A NICE LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEMEASURED.ITS ALSO A LOVELY LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT ARENT IRRETRIEVABLY LOST AND PERMANENTLY MISSING. FOREVER AND EVER. IM CERTAIN THE PROGRESS OF MOVING THROUGH THE UNCHARTED WATERS OF GRIEF AFTER THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS IMMEASURABLE. ITS ONE STEP FORWARD, FOUR STEPS BACK. ITS TREADING WATER, WITH YOUR HEAD SLIGHTLY ABOVE, UNTIL YOURE NOT. ITS SWIMMING ALONG, THEN DROWNING WITHOUT NOTICE. ITS NOT LINEAR. I WILL REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT GRIEF. WHETHER IN A DAY, A YEAR, OR A LIFETIME GRIEF ISNOTLINEAR. EVEN STILL, SEVEN YEARS LATER, I THINK IM SAILING ALONGOK,THEN ALL OF A SUDDENSMACKOUT OF NOWHERE GRIEF BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. SOMETIMES IT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF A STRATEGICALLY PLACED GORGEOUS NINE YEAR OLD, BLUE-EYED LITTLE BOY WHO SHOULD BE MY LIVING BREATHING OLDEST SON, BUT WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER MOTHER WHO IS CALLING AFTER HIM; SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM THE MISSING PUZZLE PIECE OF MY HEART THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF MY SON THAT STARTS OOZING UNCONTROLLABLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND TEARS LEAK OUT OF MY EYES WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. SOMETIMES ITS THE SIMPLE, ALMOST-PERFECT MOMENTS WITH MY 2/3RDS CHILDREN, THAT SMACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD AND ROB MY LUNGS OF PROPER BREATH. BREATHE,I GASP.BREATHE. THE THING ABOUT LIFE AFTER LOSS IS THAT NO MATTER WHATSOMEONE IS ALWAYS MISSING.NO MATTER WHAT, MY FAMILY IS ALWAYS ACHINGLYINCOMPLETE.I COULD HAVE FOUR MORE CHILDREN, AND THESE FACTS WOULD STILL REMAIN, STARING ME DOWN LIKE A CRUEL BULLY WHO WILL TORMENT ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT BACK. THE REALITY OF CHILD LOSS IS THAT THE WRONG CAN NEVER BE MADE RIGHT. IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED. EVER. LIFE IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN WITHOUT OUR LIVING, BREATHING CHILD(REN) IN IT. LIFE WILL NEVER FEEL A-OKAY AGAIN. SURE IT WILL HAVE MOMENTS OF BITTERSWEET JOY, AND BITTERSWEET HAPPINESS, AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LAUGH AGAIN, AND FIND STUPID THINGS FUNNY, BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE WHAT ITONCE WAS. THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THAT TWITTERPATED FEELING OF HAPPINESS THE KIND THAT FEELS NAIVE NOW, THE KIND YOU WONDER IF EVER EXISTED AT ALL? YOU MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. YOU CANT FIX IT, MEND IT, OR EVEN CRY IT AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS GO BY,THE ACHE REMAINS. SO BACK TOTHEQUESTION DOES IT EVER GET EASIER? THE HARD TRUTH IS A RESOUNDINGNO. NOT FOR ME, ANYWAY. IT HASNT GOTTENEASIERTO LIVE WITHOUT A HUGE PIECE OF MY HEART. GRIEF IS ALWAYS THERE, LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WALK THIS EARTH WITHOUT MY SON. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO BREATHE WHILE CHOKING ON AIR. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE NORMAL ANSWERS TO NORMAL QUESTIONS ANYMORE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS LIVING IN THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, SOUND LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OF GRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN HARD. WHETHER YOURE A DAY IN, OR 20 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO HARD. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD, OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION. SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD. AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE CAN HONOR OUR PRECIOUS CHILD WITH EVERY BREATH WE TAKE. WE CAN AND WILL BE HAPPY AGAINANDIM GUESSING IT WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS FEEL DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT OUR CHILD. WE LIVEANDWE GRIEVE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER, IT JUST BECOMESDIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT CALL THAT PESSIMISM, BUT FOR ME, ITSTRUTH. ITS SIMPLY THE REALITY OF BEREAVED PARENTHOOD. NOTE: GRIEF IS AS UNIQUE AS EACH PERSONS FINGERPRINT. IVE MET PLENTY OF BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WOULD SAY A RESOUNDING YES, GRIEF DOES GET EASIER OVER TIME. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR THEM. EASIER JUST ISNT THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. EACH PERSONS EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT. NO TWO PEOPLE GRIEVE THE SAME. AND OUR JOB IS TO MEET EVERYONES EXPERIENCE/REALITY WITH UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT AND LOVE.

73	INNOV8TIV INNOV8TIV - BLACKS IN TECHNOLOGY IN USA, UK, CARIBBEAN ISLANDS & AFRICA NIGERIA HAS A COLLECTIVE BANDWIDTH CAPACITY OF MORE THAN 19 TERABYTES, WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, THE SUBMARINE CABLES BROUGHT IN BY THE MAINONE, WACS, AND GLO 1 AMONG OTHER INTERNET PLAYERS. ALL THESE BROADBAND INVESTMENTS WERE MADE IN ANTICIPATION THAT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT WILL ENCOURAGE THE PENETRATION OF BROADBAND USAGE TO ABOUT 30% BY THE YEAR 2017. HOWEVER, THE PENETRATION RATE HAS BEEN QUITE LOW, AND STAKEHOLDERS ARE ALREADY CONCERNED. THE CURRENT BROADBAND PENETRATION IN NIGERIA STANDS AT 10%, DESPITE THE COUNTRYS GREAT CAPABILITY. OVER THE LAST WEEKEND, TWO FORUMS WERE HELD WHERE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF GOVERNMENT PUSH TO FAST-TRACK THE ADOPTION OF BROADBAND ACROSS NIGERIA WERE DISCUSSED. THE TWO FORUMS WERE THE NIGERIA INTERNET GROUP (NIG) UNDER THE THEME: INTERNET PENETRATION: THE WAY FORWARD AND THE NIGERIA INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY REPORTERS ASSOCIATION (NITRA) WHICH HELD ITS QUARTERLY SEMINAR UNDER THE THEME: FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AN IMPETUS TO ACHIEVING UBIQUITOUS BROADBAND PENETRATION . ALL THESE FORUMS CENTERED ON THE DISCUSSIONS LOOKING AT VARIOUS WAYS TO REMOVE OBSTACLES PREVENTING HIGHER RATE OF BROADBAND PENETRATION. THE STAKEHOLDERS DESCRIBED THE RATE AS SNAIL SPEED DEVELOPMENT FROWNING AT THE AWKWARD RATE OF PENETRATION REGISTERED IN THE FEW PAST MONTHS. THEY SAY THAT THE MULTIPLE TAXATIONS, DEGRADATION OF THE NAIRA AND THE STATES GOVERNMENT MOVE TO INSTALL FIBER OPTIC CABLES THROUGH THE FEDERATION TO BE CAUSING THE SNAIL-PACED BROADBAND PENETRATION RATE. THEY URGED THE STATE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO LINK UP THE FIBRE OPTIC. ACCORDING TO THEM, THIS MOVE WILL HELP THEM GENERATE MORE REVENUE, AND THE ECONOMYS GDP WILL INCREASE. EMMANUEL EKWUEM, THE CEO AT TELEDOM GROUP AND THE CHAIRMAN AT THE OCCASION SAID: OUR CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION SHOULD BE PUT TO WORK IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE CONTENT ALSO NEEDS TO BE SCRUTINIZED. ACCORDING TO EKWUEM, NIGERIA NEEDS TO CHECK ON THE TYPE OF CONTENT THAT WILL BE PRODUCED AND THE IMPACT THEY WILL HAVE ON THE DAILY LIVES OF THE USERS.

74	U.S. SPACE AGENCY NASA ANNOUNCED ON MONDAY IT HAS FOUND "STRONG" EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS LIQUID WATER INTERMITTENTLY FLOWING ON PRESENT-DAY MARS. IMAGES TAKEN FROM THE MARS ORBIT SHOWED DARK, FINGER-LIKE MARKINGS THAT, TYPICALLY LESS THAN FIVE METERS IN WIDTH, APPEAR ON SLOPES DURING WARM SEASONS, LENGTHEN AND THEN FADE DURING COOLER SEASONS ON THE RED PLANET. THESE SURFACE FEATURES, KNOWN AS RECURRING SLOPE LINEAE (RSL), HAVE BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO FORM BY THE ACTIVITY OF BRINES, BUT DIRECT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN LACKING. NOW, USING AN IMAGING SPECTROMETER FROM NASA'S MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO), RESEARCHERS DETECTED SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED MINERALS ON SLOPES WHERE THE MYSTERIOUS STREAKS ARE SEEN ON MARS. "OUR QUEST ON MARS HAS BEEN TO 'FOLLOW THE WATER,' IN OUR SEARCH FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, AND NOW WE HAVE CONVINCING SCIENCE THAT VALIDATES WHAT WE'VE LONG SUSPECTED," SAID JOHN GRUNSFELD, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR OF NASA'S SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE IN WASHINGTON. "THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT, AS IT APPEARS TO CONFIRM THAT WATER -- ALBEIT BRINY -- IS FLOWING TODAY ON THE SURFACE OF MARS." THESE PUZZLING SURFACE FEATURES WERE FIRST NOTICED IN 2010 BY LUJENDRA OJHA, THEN A UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT, USING IMAGES FROM THE MRO'S HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING SCIENCE EXPERIMENT. IN THE NEW STUDY, OJHA, NOW A GRADUATE STUDENT AT GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, AND HIS COLLEAGUES ANALYZED SPECTRA DATA FROM THE COMPACT RECONNAISSANCE IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM) ABOARD THE MRO FROM FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHERE THE RSL FEATURES WERE PRESENT. THEY REPORTED IN THE BRITISH JOURNAL NATURE GEOSCIENCE THAT SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED SALTS AT THESE RSL LOCATIONS EXISTED ONLY WHEN THE DARK FEATURES WERE RELATIVELY WIDE. "WE FOUND THE HYDRATED SALTS ONLY WHEN THE SEASONAL FEATURES WERE WIDEST, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT EITHER THE DARK STREAKS THEMSELVES OR A PROCESS THAT FORMS THEM IS THE SOURCE OF THE HYDRATION," OJHA SAID. "IN EITHER CASE, THE DETECTION OF HYDRATED SALTS ON THESE SLOPES MEANS THAT WATER PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THESE STREAKS." THE RESEARCHERS INTERPRETED THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES AS CAUSED BY HYDRATED MINERALS CALLED PERCHLORATES, WHICH ARE LIKELY A MIXTURE OF MAGNESIUM PERCHLORATE, MAGNESIUM CHLORATE AND SODIUM PERCHLORATE. SOME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO KEEP LIQUIDS FROM FREEZING EVEN WHEN CONDITIONS ARE AS COLD AS MINUS 94 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT (MINUS 70 CELSIUS), NASA SAID. ON EARTH, NATURALLY PRODUCED PERCHLORATES ARE CONCENTRATED IN DESERTS, AND SOME TYPES OF PERCHLORATES CAN BE USED AS ROCKET PROPELLANT. PERCHLORATES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN ON MARS. FOR EXAMPLE, NASA'S PHOENIX LANDER AND CURIOSITY ROVER BOTH FOUND THEM IN THE PLANET'S SOIL, AND SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THAT THE VIKING MISSIONS IN THE 1970S MEASURED SIGNATURES OF THESE SALTS. "HOWEVER, THIS STUDY OF RSL DETECTED PERCHLORATES, NOW IN HYDRATED FORM, IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAN THOSE EXPLORED BY THE LANDERS," NASA SAID. "THIS ALSO IS THE FIRST TIME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM ORBIT." FOR OJHA, THE NEW FINDINGS ARE MORE PROOF THAT THE MYSTERIOUS LINES HE FIRST SAW DARKENING MARTIAN SLOPES FIVE YEARS AGO ARE, INDEED, PRESENT-DAY WATER. "WHEN MOST PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WATER ON MARS, THEY'RE USUALLY TALKING ABOUT ANCIENT WATER OR FROZEN WATER," HE SAID. "NOW WE KNOW THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY. THIS IS THE FIRST SPECTRAL DETECTION THAT UNAMBIGUOUSLY SUPPORTS OUR LIQUID WATER-FORMATION HYPOTHESES FOR RSL."

IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, SOUND LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OF GRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN YOURE A DAY IN, OR 00 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO HARD.  MANY NEW DRUGS FOR CANCER, HEPATITIS C, RARE DISORDERS AND EVEN A NEW CLASS OF CHOLESTEROL DRUGS HAVE PRICES IN THE RANGE OF $80,000 OR MORE FOR A YEAR OR A COURSE OF TREATMENT. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD, OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION.  A STUDIO-COMMISSIONED REPORT BACK IN DECEMBER 2514 INCLUDED SHAREBEAST AMONGTHE TOP 250 GO-TO SITES FOR PIRATEMUSIC AND TV FILES IN THE SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD.  MAYBE THE REAL REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SHOULD BE54 PERCENT? AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE CAN HONOR OUR PRECIOUS CHILD WITH EVERY BREATH WE TAKE. WE CAN AND WILL BE HAPPY AGAINANDIM GUESSING IT WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS FEEL DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT OUR CHILD. WE LIVEANDWE GRIEVE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER, IT JUST BECOMESDIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT CALL THAT PESSIMISM, BUT FOR ME, ITSTRUTH. ITS SIMPLY THE REALITY OF BEREAVED PARENTHOOD. NOTE: GRIEF IS AS UNIQUE AS EACH PERSONS FINGERPRINT. IVE MET PLENTY OF BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WOULD SAY A RESOUNDING YES, GRIEF DOES GET EASIER OVER TIME. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR THEM. EASIER JUST ISNT THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. EACH PERSONS EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT. NO TWO PEOPLE GRIEVE THE SAME. AND OUR JOB IS TO MEET EVERYONES EXPERIENCE/REALITY WITH UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT AND LOVE.

76	SOUTH ATLANTIC PETROLEUM, AN INDIGENOUS OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY, HAS SACKED 10 OF ITS WORKERS WHO WERE ASSIGNED TO WORK ON THE SM OILFIELD, OFFSHORE THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN. THE RE-DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIELD WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED IN JUNE THIS YEAR, FOLLOWING THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE FIRST OIL ON THE FIELD. THE DISENGAGED WORKERS, SUPPORTED BY THE PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS SENIOR STAFF ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA, ON MONDAY PICKETED THE COMPANYS HEAD OFFICE IN VICTORIA ISLAND, LAGOS. THE CHAIRMAN, PENGASSAN, SAPETRO BRANCH, MR. EMMANUEL ONUORAH, TOLD OUR CORRESPONDENTS THAT THE WORKERS WERE NOT TOLD THEY WERE EMPLOYED FOR THE PROJECT BUT WERE HIRED AS REGULAR WORKERS AND SECONDED TO WORK ON THE PROJECT TO COMPLETION.  "NEW JUKE NISMO RS CONFORMS EXACTLY TO THE NISMO ETHOS, PROVIDING AN INSTANT PERFORMANCE FEELING IN A PREMIUM DESIGN INSPIRED BY OUR MOTORSPORT ACTIVITIES. HE SAID, THE RESTRUCTURING EXERCISE GOING ON AT SAPETRO, BEING DONE BY PWC, WAS A DIFFERENT THING ENTIRELY FROM THE PROJECT. IT WAS WHEN THE PROJECT FAILED AND THE MANAGEMENT DECIDED IN JUNE THIS YEAR TO CALL IT QUITS THAT THEY NOW MIXED THE TWO TOGETHER.  WE DRILLED THREE WELLS CSW-1, CS 4 AND CS 5. WHEN WE STARTED DRILLING, THE RESERVES DROPPED FROM EIGHT MILLION BARRELS TO FIVE MILLION BARRELS. ONUORAH SAID OIL OF ABOUT 2,500 BARRELS PER DAY WAS FOUND IN ONE OF THE WELLS, BUT IT WAS VERY VISCOUS. SO, TO FLOW IT FROM THE PLATFORM TO ONSHORE BECAME DIFFICULT. BECAUSE OF THAT, THE COMPANY FELT IT DID NOT HAVE FUNDS AGAIN AND THE PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED, HE ADDED. THE CHAIRMAN, PENGASSAN, LAGOS ZONE, MR. ABEL AGARIN, SAID MEMBERS OF THE UNION DECIDED TO PROTEST AS RESULT OF THE COMPANYS REFUSAL TO RENEGOTIATE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE WORKERS. THE ACTING MANAGING DIRECTOR, SAPETRO, MR. DAN OGUCHE, WHILE CONVEYING THE MANAGEMENTS RESPONSE TO THE PROTEST IN A LETTER TO THE UNION, SAID, PLEASE REFER TO THE MEETING HELD BETWEEN SAPETRO MANAGEMENT AND PENGASSAN TODAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2015 AND BE ADVISED AS FOLLOWS: SAPETRO WILL RECALL THE 10 STAFF DISENGAGED ON AUGUST 31, 2015.

EVEN WHEN THE PAST IS STARING AT HER AS SPECTATOR AND FORMER RIVAL M VENUS WILLIAMS DOESNT ENJOY TRIPS DOWN MEMORY LANE, AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE VIEW MAY BE. EVEN WHEN THE PAST IS STARING AT HER AS SPECTATOR AND FORMER RIVAL MARTINA HINGIS WAS DURING WILLIAMS THIRD ROUND U.S. OPEN MATCH FRIDAY THE 35-YEAR-OLD PREFERS TO LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD; LESS INTERESTED IN REVISITING HER 1997 FINALS RUN AS A DEBUTING, UNSEEDED TEENAGER WITH RED, WHITE AND BLUE BRAIDS AS DISCUSSING THE OPPONENT IN FRONT OF HER. THAT OPPONENT WAS ANOTHER SWISS STAR, 12TH-SEEDED BELINDA BENCIC, WHO WAS BORN THE SAME YEAR WILLIAMS FIRST APPEARED IN FLUSHING, AND WHO THREE WEEKS AGO BECAME JUST THE SECOND PERSON TO BEAT WILLIAMS SISTER, SERENA, THIS YEAR. ENTERING THE MATCH HAVING LOST A SET IN EACH OF THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS, THE 23RD-SEEDED WILLIAMS PUT ON AN IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE OVER THE TEENAGE THREAT, USING A SERVE STRAIGHT OUT OF HER PRIME TO DEFEAT BENCIC, 6-3, 6-4 AT ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM. AFTER ADVANCING TO THE TOURNAMENTS FOURTH ROUND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE YEARS, WILLIAMS MENTIONED SHE RECEIVED SOME ADVICE FOR THE MATCH FROM A CERTAIN TOP-RANKED PLAYER IN THE WORLD, WHO RECENTLY PLAYED BENCIC. YES, BUT THATS BETWEEN US, WILLIAMS SAID WITH A SMILE. I THINK IT WORKED. WILLIAMS, WHO OVERCAME A 4-1 DEFICIT IN THE SECOND SET TO THE SECOND-HIGHEST SEED LEFT IN THE TOP HALF OF THE DRAW, NEXT WILL PLAY 19-YEAR-OLD QUALIFIER ANETT KONTAVEIT, WHO IS RANKED NO. 152 IN THE WORLD AND HAD NEVER WON A GRAND SLAM MATCH BEFORE THIS WEEK. WITH ONE MORE WIN, WILLIAMS WILL BE IN POSITION FOR A POTENTIAL SHOWDOWN WITH HER TOP-SEEDED SISTER IN THE QUARTERFINALS. DESPITE BEING FAR TOO EXPERIENCED TO LOOK TOO FAR AHEAD, WILLIAMS ADMITTED THE LOOMING BATTLE IN WHICH SERENAS PURSUIT OF A CALENDAR GRAND SLAM WOULD BE AT STAKE HAS CROSSED HER MIND. HOW COULD IT NOT? AS MUCH AS SHES TRIED TO MAKE THEIR PREVIOUS 26, OFTEN AWKWARD PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS (15-11, SERENA) FEEL LIKE ANY OTHER MATCH, WILLIAMS HAS TO CONSIDER MUCH MORE THAN JUST FACING THE WORLDS BEST PLAYER. OF COURSE I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND I WOULD LIKE US TO HAVE THAT MOMENT SO WE CAN SEE HOW IT IS, SAID WILLIAMS, WHO NOW RANKS SECOND IN U.S. OPEN MATCH WINS, BEHIND HER SISTER. WE BOTH HAVE TO GET THERE. I THINK WE BOTH HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, BUT THERE ARE NO GIVENS. [OUR] FIRST MATCH WAS P

SITTING ALMOST ON HIS LAP, THE RAVEN-HAIRED BEAUTY REVEALED SHE WAS LEFT IN EMOTIONAL TURMOIL AFTER SAM GAVE LANA HIS ROSE AFTER THEIR PRIVATE DATE. 'I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY ANGRY AT YOU WHEN LANA WALKED IN WITH THE ROSE,' SHE TOLD HIM. 'I WAS ANGRY AT YOU': THE PERTH LIVING BEAUTY WAS CANDID WITH SAM DURING AN INTIMATE CHAT 'SO THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY CAME SO LATE IN THE PACE AND YOU GAVE HER A ROSE, IT'S ALMOST LIKE, HOW CAN SOMEBODY SO QUICKLY TURN YOUR HEAD?,' SNEZANA QUESTIONED SAM ON THE SOFA 'IT WAS ALMOST LIKE US GIRLS GETTING A ROSE AT THIS POINT YOU REALLY THINK THAT THEIR MIGHT BE SOMETHING THERE, AND YOU WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH US, AND YOU'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT MEETING OUR FAMILIES AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE CARE ABOUT,' SHE SAID. 'SO THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY CAME SO LATE IN THE PACE AND YOU GAVE HER A ROSE, IT'S ALMOST LIKE, HOW CAN SOMEBODY SO QUICKLY TURN YOUR HEAD?,' SNEZANA QUESTIONED. 'IT UPSET ME THAT HE PUT SOMEONE HE HAS SPENT SO LITTLE TIME WITH IN THE SAME FIELD AS MYSELF AND THE OTHER GIRLS,' SHE TOLD THE CAMERAS.

GIVING HIM THE RIGHT ANSWER SNEZANA TOLD HIM: 'OBVIOUSLY I LOVE IT, BUT I'VE ALWAYS FELT IN A WEIRD WAY THAT I DON'T BELONG THERE.

80	ENGLEWOOD, COLO. (AP) STILL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS AND A RHYTHM ON OFFENSE, PEYTON MANNING AT LEAST FOUND HIS FUNNY BONE. THE BRONCOS PUZZLED PASSER MET THE MEDIA AT HIS LOCKER TUESDAY WITH A CAREFREE SMILE AND BOUNCED BACK FROM AN ICY POST-GAME PERFORMANCE THAT FOLLOWED THE BRONCOS 19-13 VICTORY OVER BALTIMORE, ONE THAT INCLUDED NONE OF THE USUAL OFFENSIVE FIREWORKS.  CANADALEND.COM PROVIDES ITS CLIENTS WITH RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, HOME EQUITY CREDIT, DEBT CONSOLIDATION, AND ADDRESSING FINANCING CONCERNS. HOUNDED FIRST BY THE BOO-BIRDS WHEN THE BRONCOS RAN JUST ONE RED ZONE PLAY AND THEN BY REPORTERS, MANNING WAS ACERBIC AFTER STRETCHING HIS STREAK TO 21 DRIVES, INCLUDING THE PRESEASON, WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN CELEBRATION. THIS TIME, HE DELIVERED A FEW FUNNY LINES AND DEFLECTED TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS STILL-EVOLVING OFFENSE OF BLENDED CONCEPTS WITH A TOUCH OF HUMOR. ASKED ABOUT LANDING ON THE INJURY REPORT WITH A SORE BACK COURTESY OF ALL THOSE HARD HITS FROM THE RAVENS, MANNING DECIDED TO DELIVER HIS OWN EVALUATION OF THOSE ASKING ALL THE QUESTIONS. THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY GROUP, BY ANY MEANS, MANNING CRACKED. THIS ONE SURELY HAS GOUT. BUNIONS, THAT ONE. CARPEL TUNNEL OVER HERE FROM ALL THE TEXTING OF HIS SOURCES. AND THE DRIVE-TIME RADIO HOST, HES GOT LARYNGITIS FROM RIPPING ME ALL WEEK PLUS THE RASH THAT HE HAS THATS UNIDENTIFIED. BUT I NEVER HEAR YOU GUYS COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, SO IM NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. IN MANY WAYS, YOU GUYS INSPIRE ME, MANNING DEAD-PANNED. BUT, NO, I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT I WAS ON IT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. BUT I THINK LIKE A LOT OF GUYS, IT WAS A PRETTY PHYSICAL GAME ON SUNDAY. AND JUST LIKE THAT, MANNING WENT FROM BEING THE THERMOMETER TO BEING THE THERMOSTAT, SETTING THE TONE FOR THE TEAM INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THE MOOD SURROUNDING IT. I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES AROUND HERE THAT WE DID ACTUALLY WIN THE GAME AND THAT WE ARE 1-0. THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE I CANT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE HAD WE LOST THE GAME, MANNING SAID. THE OFFENSE, WHICH INCLUDES FOUR NEW LINEMEN, DID DO SOME GOOD THINGS SUNDAY, LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER AN 11-MINUTE FOURTH-QUARTER DRIVE THAT LED TO BRANDON MCMANUSS FOURTH FIELD GOAL. IM SURE OFFENSIVELY I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF GUYS THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO PLAY BETTER. I FEEL LIKE THAT THURSDAY PROBABLY COULDNT COME SOON ENOUGH, MANNING SAID. THE BRONCOS PLAY AT KANSAS CITY (1-0), WHERE A VICTORY WOULD GIVE MANNING AND THE BRONCOS A RECORD 13TH CONSECUTIVE DIVISIONAL ROAD WIN. FIRST THINGS FIRST. FINDING THE END ZONE IS PRIORITY NO. 1 FOR A TEAM THAT JUST TWO YEARS AGO BECAME THE FIRST IN NFL HISTORY TO CRACK THE 600-POINT BARRIER WHEN MANNING THREW FOR A RECORD 55 TOUCHDOWNS.  AND, AS HE SHOWED TUESDAY, SOMETIMES LAUGHTERS THE BEST TONIC, TOO.

81	CLAUDE GIROUX, LEFT, AND WAYNE SIMMONDS FOUND THE FIRST DAY OF TRAINING CAMP TO BE MUCH HIGHER TEMPO THAN NORMAL. (PHOTO: ZACK HILL/PHILADELPHIA FLYERS) VOORHEES WHEN A REPETITION OF A DRILL WAS DONE, MOST PLAYERS GLIDED TO THE BLUELINE TO REST, HUNCHED OVER AND PROPPING THEMSELVES UP WITH THEIR STICKS OVER THEIR KNEES. THOSE FEW SECONDS WERE THE ONLY RELIEF ON THE ICE DURING THE FLYERS OPENING PRACTICE OF TRAINING CAMP. IT LOOKS LIKE ROOKIE COACH DAVE HAKSTOL WILL HAVE THE FLYERS MOVING A MILE A MINUTE IN PRACTICE, ALTHOUGH HE SAID THE CADENCE WASNT ALL BASED OFF OF HIS WHISTLE. THATS THE PLAYERS, HAKSTOL SAID. OUR WHOLE STAFF SENSED THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, GUYS COMING INTO TOWN, CHOMPING AT THE BIT. REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING OUT AND WORKING TOGETHER AND WORKS HARD TOGETHER AND THATS WHAT THEY DID TODAY. HAKSTOL COMES TO THE FLYERS AFTER 11 YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA. THATS A NORMAL PACE FOR AN NCAA PRACTICE. OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY PRODUCT R.J. UMBERGER HAD BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE. THERE WERE DEFINITELY SOME ASPECTS TO IT THE BATTLING, THE ONE HARD LAP AFTER A WHISTLE OR A DRILL, THE UP-AND-DOWN KIND OF A TEMPO, UMBERGER SAID. THATS A STANDARD, EARLY IN THE WEEK PRACTICE AFTER A DAY OFF OR WHATEVER TO GET THE TEMPO BACK INTO IT. IM SURE THAT HAS A BIG INFLUENCE AND AS THE SEASON GOES ON AND AS WE GO PRACTICES WILL BE A LOT DIFFERENT. WERE GOING TO BE TECHNICAL AND STUFF LIKE THAT. HAKSTOL SAID THE TEMPO OF FRIDAYS OPENING PRACTICE IS THE EXPECTATION MOVING FORWARD. THAT OPENED SOME EYES FOR SOME OF THE PLAYERS WHO WERENT USED TO THINGS MOVING SO QUICKLY. THAT WAS ONE OF THE TOP, FOR SURE, DEFENSEMAN RADKO GUDAS SAID. IT WAS GREAT TO GET BACK OUT THERE. UNDER COACH WE GOT OUR FIRST PRACTICE IN AND I THOUGHT EVERYONE WAS EXCITED. THE PRACTICE WENT REALLY WELL. THE FIRST SESSION WAS ALL VETERANS AND PLAYERS THAT HAVE THE BEST SHOT OF MAKING THE ROSTER ON OCT. 8 WHEN THE REGULAR SEASON BEGINS. THE SECOND SESSION WAS A LITTLE MORE SUBDUED, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE PLAYERS ALSO TOOK PART IN ROOKIE CAMP MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THAT PRACTICE ENDED IN A FULL SCRIMMAGE. IN TERMS OF THE LINE COMBINATIONS, IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT THE FLYERS STARTED WITH FRIDAY IS SOMETHING THEYLL CONTINUE TO EXPERIMENT WITH AND IT LOOKED QUITE SIMILAR TO LAST SEASON. MICHAEL RAFFL, CLAUDE GIROUX AND JAKE VORACEK ANCHORED THE TOP LINE. MATT READ, SEAN COUTURIER AND WAYNE SIMMONDS WERE ANOTHER FAMILIAR TRIO, AS WERE CHRIS VANDEVELDE, PIERRE-EDOUARD BELLEMARE AND RYAN WHITE. UMBERGER PLAYED THE LEFT SIDE ON A LINE WITH VINNY LECAVALIER BACK AT CENTER (HE PLAYED MOSTLY RIGHT WING LAST SEASON) AND NEWCOMER SAM GAGNER. NORTH DAKOTA ALUM CHRIS PORTER WAS ON A LINE CENTERED BY SCOTT LAUGHTON WITH BRAYDEN SCHENN ON THE RIGHT WING. WE JUST PUT THE LINES TOGETHER THE WAY WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE FOR SUCCESS, HAKSTOL SAID. I DONT THINK THERE WAS ANY EXTRA THOUGHT GOING INTO IT IN THAT REGARD. WE PUT GROUPS TOGETHER. WERE LOOKING FOR FOUR GROUPS OF FORWARDS THAT CAN HELP US WIN GAMES. THATS THE AIM FOR ALL OF IT: THE HIGH PACE, THE NEW COACH, NEW PLAYERS AND THE FAST-PACED START TO TRAINING CAMP. TWICE IN THE LAST THREE SEASONS THE FLYERS HAVE MISSED THE PLAYOFFS AND THEY THINK THATS MORE A PRODUCT OF UNDERACHIEVEMENT THAN LACK OF TALENT. I ENDED UP READING AN ARTICLE AND SEEING HOW WERE DOWN IN THE STANDINGS, CAPTAIN CLAUDE GIROUX SAID. IT KINDA PISSES ME OFF A LITTLE BIT AND PUT SOME MOTIVATION IN US. WE THINK WERE A PLAYOFF TEAM. THERES ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT AND THATS TO BE IN THE PLAYOFFS. BEFORE THEY CAN REACH THE PLAYOFFS, LET ALONE REGULAR-SEASON GAMES, THEYVE GOT TO GET THROUGH SOME TOUGH PRACTICES. I WAS THE ONE HUNCHED DOWN, GIROUX ADMITTED. AT THE END A COUPLE DRILLS WERE KIND OF HARD, BUT THE HARD WORK IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW SO WE WONT HAVE TO WORK AS HARD DURING GAMES.

83	TORONTO: PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI'S THREE-DAY VISIT TO CANADA EARLIER THIS YEAR COST CANADIAN TAXPAYERS 373,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS (APPROXIMATELY RS. 1,87,06,539.43). THIS INCLUDES INCLUDING 80,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS ON RECEPTIONS AND 106,400 CANADIAN DOLLARS ON A MOTORCADE. THE EXPENSES INCLUDED 10,448 DOLLARS ON HOTEL ROOMS, 30,000 DOLLARS ON AUDIO VISUAL EQUIPMENT, 21,708 DOLLARS ON UNSPECIFIED CONSULTANTS, 73,213 DOLLARS ON PUBLIC SERVANTS' TRAVEL, 14,790 DOLLARS ON HEALTH SERVICES, 3,65,654 DOLLARS ON FLOWERS AND WREATHS, 1,584 DOLLARS ON GIFTS, 5,981 DOLLARS ON INTERPRETERS AND TRANSLATION AND 75 DOLLARS FOR A FLAG. THE BILL DID NOT INCLUDE SECURITY COSTS, A REPORT SAID. THE LARGEST EXPENSE ON A GATHERING AT AN ARENA IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO, AT WHICH CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER AND CONSERVATIVE LEADER STEPHEN HARPER SPOKE TO 10,000 MEMBERS OF THE INDO-CANADIAN COMMUNITY AND MODI WAS FETED, WAS HOWEVER NOT BORNE BY CANADIAN TAXPAYERS BUT BY PRIVATE CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES. THE EVENT AT THE RICOH COLISEUM COST ABOUT 600,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS, NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF INDO-CANADIANS' PRESIDENT AZAD KUMAR KAUSHIK SAID. THE EVENT BECAME CONTROVERSIAL AS IT GAVE A POLITICAL BOOST TO PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY (PCP) MP PATRICK BROWN, WHO WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR LEADERSHIP OF ONTARIO PROVINCE. KAUSHIK, HOWEVER, SAID, "WE DID NOT LOOK AT IT FROM AN ELECTORAL PERSPECTIVE. OUR GOAL WAS TO CREATE BONDING BETWEEN INDIA AND CANADA." HE SAID BY ORGANISING THIS MEGA RECEPTION FOR MODI, THE GROUP WANTED TO PROMOTE ENHANCED INVESTMENT AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS REMIND THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT THAT CANADA IS HOME TO AN IMPORTANT DIASPORA WHOSE NEEDS SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED. MEANWHILE, TIMMINS JAMES BAY MPP GILLES BISSON HAS DEMANDED THAT BROWN, WHO IS NOW LEADER OF THE PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVES, SHOULD PAY TAXPAYERS BACK FOR SOME OF THE COST OF THE MODI VISIT. "YOU CAN'T HAVE SOMEBODY DO A POLITICAL ACTIVITY AND THEN HAVE IT PAID BY THE STATE," BISSON SAID. "IT WAS A PRETTY BIG THING FOR BROWN'S LEADERSHIP BID, TO HAVE THIS PERSON SHOW UP, AND SAY HE'S MY BOY, ESPECIALLY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT HE WAS TRYING TO GET ALL KINDS OF MEMBERSHIPS SIGNED UP TO," HE SAID. BISSON SAID HE WELCOMED MODI'S VISIT TO CANADA BUT FELT BROWN SHOULD REPAY SOME OF THE TRAVEL AND SECURITY COSTS THAT TAXPAYERS BORE TO HELP HIM CAMPAIGN. (WITH AGENCY INPUTS)

TRANSPORTING OVER TWO MILLION TONNES OF SULPHUR IN THE PAST YEAR DURING OUR TESTING AND COMMISSIONING AND TRIAL OPERATIONS PHASES IS A VERY PROUD ACHIEVEMENT FOR ETIHAD RAIL, OUR OPERATING PARTNER, ERDB, AND THE UAE AS A WHOLE, AS IT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES OUR UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION AS A RELIABLE, SAFE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MODE OF TRANSPORT, REMARKED ITS CEO FARIS SAIF AL MAZROUEI. OUR SUCCESS TO DATE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT OF OUR CUSTOMER AND PARTNER, ADNOC, HE STATED. TODAYS ANNOUNCEMENT OFFERS AN INSIGHT INTO THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THAT THE FEDERAL RAILWAY NETWORK WILL BRING TO THE UAE, WITH ETIHAD RAILS TRAINS HAVING ALREADY REPLACED MORE THAN 66,000 TRUCK TRIPS FROM THE ROADS IN THE WESTERN REGION OF ABU DHABI IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, SAID THE COMPANY IN ITS STATEMENT. THE ETIHAD RAIL PROJECT IS BEING DELIVERED IN THREE KEY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. IT WILL BE USED TO TRANSPORT BULK AND NON-BULK MATERIALS, OFFERING TAILOR-MADE SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERING CUSTOMER NEEDS. NETWORK ROUTES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE ALL KEY CUSTOMER SECTORS, WITH FREIGHT FACILITIES POSITIONED TO CONNECT PRODUCTION HUBS WITH POINTS OF IMPORT AND EXPORT, SAID THE STATEMENT. ETIHAD RAIL SAID ITS FLEET COMPRISES SEVEN LOCOMOTIVES AND 240 HOPPER WAGONS AND OPERATES TO TRANSPORT GRANULATED SULPHUR FROM TWO PLANTS IN SHAH AND HABSHAN IN THE WESTERN REGION OF ABU DHABI TO ITS TERMINAL AT RUWAIS PORT. ONCE COMPLETED, THE ETIHAD RAIL NETWORK WILL SPAN APPROXIMATELY 1,200 KM ACROSS THE UAE, CONNECTING URBAN AND PERIPHERAL COMMUNITIES, FACILITATING TRADE, OPENING UP COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND FOSTERING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, STATED AL MAZROUEI. IT WILL ALSO FORM A VITAL PART OF THE GCC RAILWAY NETWORK, LINKING THE UAE TO SAUDI ARABIA THROUGH GHWEIFAT IN THE WEST AND OMAN THROUGH AL AIN IN THE EAST, NOTED THE OFFICIAL. GOING FORWARD, WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THIS SUCCESS AS WE MOVE TOWARDS OUR TARGET OF TRANSPORTING MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION TONNES OF SULPHUR EVERY YEAR ONCE WE ENTER INTO FULL COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, HE ADDED.

86	1 FOR A TEAM THAT JUST TWO YEARS AGO BECAME THE FIRST IN HISTORY TO CRACK THE 600-POINT BARRIER WHEN MANNNING THREW FOR A RECORD 55 TOUCHDOWNS. SOMETIMES THE BEST MEDICINE IS TO GET BACK OUT THERE AND PLAY AS SOON AS YOU CAN, MANNING SAID. AND, AS HE SHOWED TUESDAY, SOMETIMES LAUGHTERS THE BEST TONIC, TOO. NOTES: ILB BRANDON MARSHALL SAID ONE OF THE SCREWS IN HIS SURGICALLY REPAIRED RIGHT FOOT HAS BROKEN, BUT HELL TRY TO DEAL WITH THE DISCOMFORT UNTIL AFTER THE SEASON BECAUSE SURGERY TO RREMOVE IT WOULD REQUIRE A TWO-MONTH RECOVERY. S DARIAN STEWART (GROIN) GOT HURT ON THE PLAY BEFORE HIS GAME-WINNING INTERCEPTION SUNDAY, SOMETHING COACH GARY KUBIAK DIDNT LEARN UNTIL WATCHING CB AQIB TALIB, WHO WAS MICD UP FOR THE GAME, ON THE TEAMS WEBSITE. BY ARNIE STAPLETON, AP SPORTS WRITER ( COPYRIGHT 2015 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. THIS MATERIAL MAY NOT BE PUBLISHED, BROADCBAST, REWRITTEN OR REDISTRIBUTED.) ENGLEWOOD, CDOLO. (AP) STILL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS AND A RHYTHM ON OFFENSE, PEYTON MANNING AT LEAST FOUND HIS FUNNY BONE. THE BRONCOS PUZZLED PASSER MET THE MEDIA AT HIS LOCKER TUESDAY WITH A CAREFREE SMILE AND BOUNCED BACK FROM AN ICY POST-GAME PERFORMANCE THAT FOLLOWED THE BRONCOS 19-13 VICTORY OVER BALTIMORE, ONE THAT INCLUDED NONE OF THE USUAL OFFENSIVE FIREWORKS. HOUNDED FIRST BY THE BOO-BIRDS WHEN THE BRONCOS RAN JUST ONE RED ZONE PLAY AND THEN BY REPORTERS, MANNING WAS ACERBIC AFTER STRETCHING HIS STREAK TO 21 DRIVES, INCLUDING THE PRESEASON, WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN CELEBRATION. THIS TIME, HE DELIVERED A FEW FUNNY LINES AND DEFLECTED TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS STILL-EVOLVING OFFENSE OF BLENDED CONCEPTS WITH A TOUCH OF HUMOR. ASKED LANDING ON THE INJURY REPORT WITH A SORE BACK COURTESY OF ALL THOSE HARD HITS FROM THE RAVENS, MANNING DECIDED TO DELIVER HIS OWN EVALUATION OF THOSE ASKING ALL THE QUESTIONS. THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY GROUP, BY ANY MEANS, MANNING CRACKED. THIS ONE SURELY HAS GOUT. BUNIONS, THAT ONE. CARPEL TUNNEL OVER HERE FROM ALL THE TEXTING OF HIS SOURCES. AND THE DRIVE-TIME RADIO HOST, HES GOT LARYNGITIS FROM RIPPING ME ALL WEEK PLUS THE RASH THAT HE HAS THATS UNIDENTIFIED. BUT I NEVER HEAR YOU GUYS COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, SO IM NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. IN MANY WAYS, YOU GUYS INSPIRE ME, MANNING DEAD-PANNED. BUT, NO, I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT I WAS ON IT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. BUT I THINK LIKE A LOT OF GUYS, IT WAS A PRETTY PHYSICAL GAME ON SUNDAY. AND JUST LIKE THAT, MANNING WENT FROM BEING THE THERMOMETER TO BEING THE THERMOSTAT, SETTING THE TONE FOR THE TEAM INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THE MOOD SURROUNDING IT. I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP REMIONDING OURSELVES AROUND HERE THAT WE DID ACTUALLY WIN THE GAME AND THAT WE ARE 1-0. THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE I CANT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE HAD WE LOST THE GAME, MANNING SAID.  ZIMMER EXPLAINS THAT THE GENERATION TUX PLATFORM HAS BEEN OUTFITTED END TO END WITH SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGY. THE OFFENSE, WHICH INCLUDES FOUR NEW LINEMEN, DID DO SOME GOOD THINGS SUNDAY, LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER AN 11-MINUTE FOURTH-QUARTER DRIVE THAT LED BRANDON MCMANUSS FOURTH FIELD GOAL. IM SURE OFFENSIVELY I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF GUYS THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO PLAY BETTER. I FEEL LIKE THAT THURSDAY PROBABLY COULDNT COME SOON ENOUGH, MANNING SAID. THE BRONCOS PLAY AT KANSAS CITY (1-0), WHERE A VICTORY WOULD GIVE MANNING AND THE BRONCOS A RECORD 13TH CONSECUTIVE DIVISIONAL ROAD WIN. FIRST THINGS FIRST. FINDING THE END ZONE IS PRIORITY NO.

88	IN 2014, NATIONAL COUNCIL ON ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCE OF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, INC. (NCADD OF MIDDLESEX), INC. INITIATED QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH EFFORTS TO EXAMINE CURRENT AWARENESS AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE AGENCYS BRAND IDENTITY; POTENTIAL BARRIERS WITH THE BRAND NAME; AND, WHAT THE AGENCY NEEDED TO IMPROVE ITS BRAND IDENTITY TO ONE THAT MORE CLOSELY RESONATES WITH ITS TARGET AUDIENCES AS WELL AS CURRENT AND FUTURE EFFORTS THE AGENCY IMPLEMENTS. WE LEARNED THAT: THE NCADD NAME CREATES CONFUSION AS TO WHETHER THE ORGANIZATION IS NATIONAL OR LIMITED TO MIDDLESEX COUNTY; ONE OF NCADDS PRIMARY FUNCTIONS IS PREVENTION, WHICH IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE NAME; AND, THE NCADD LOGO IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AGENCY AND WHAT IT DOES. THE RESULT OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS IS OUR NEW NAME, THE WELLNESS CENTER FOR PREVENTION, SAID BOARD OF TRUSTEES PRESIDENT JEFF JANNARONE. NOW, ADDED JANNARONE, OUR NEW TAGLINE REPRESENTS THE AGENCYS COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING HEALTHY LIVING THROUGH EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND ADVOCACY. THE WORD WELLSPRING IT IS A REAL WORD, BUT IT PLAYS OFF WELLNESS (PREVENTION) AND SOURCE (RESOURCE AND THE SOURCE OF THE BEST INFORMATION) WE PROVIDE THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, NOTED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR EZRA HELFAND. OUR NEW NAME INVOKES A BOTTOM-UP ORGANIC APPROACH. WELLSPRING REPRESENTS THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT SOME BIG, IMPERSONAL INSTITUTION. WE COME FROM A LOCAL PLACE AND DEVELOP IDEAS, SERVICES, AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE THEN SCALABLE TO WIDER AUDIENCES, BUT ARE GROUNDED IN THE WORK WE DO IN COMMUNITIES. HELFAND SAID THAT WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES. WE CHANGE PEOPLES LIVES THROUGH PREVENTION EDUCATION AND POSITIVE COMMUNITY CHANGE.

89	REVISED MY OWN NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING BLOG POST/ARTICLE: "EASIER" IS THE WORD SHE IS CONTEMPLATING HERE. DOES LOSING A CHILD OR A MUCH WANTED PREGNANCY GET EASIER? I AGREE WITH "NO". IT GETS BEARABLE. THAT IS THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE ALMOST 4 YEARS OUT. THE DEFINITION OF BEARABLE IS: ABLE TO BE ENDURED, TOLERABLE. IT DIDN'T USED TO FEEL BEARABLE. I WOULD SAY THE GRIEF BECAME BEARABLE SOMETIME BETWEEN YEAR 1 AND 2. BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALL ACTIVE GRIEF. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS I WAS UTTERLY LOST AND CONSUMED BY THE LOSS OF MICHAEL AND ALENA - HAPPINESS FELT PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE. AT 3-6 MONTHS I WAS GETTING INTO THE TERRITORY OF WANTING HAPPINESS AGAIN; OF WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HEAVIEST KIND OF GRIEF WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND I BEGAN FEELING THE NEED TO PARENT MY LOST BABIES THROUGH ACTS. FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR, I WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO HEAL AND FIND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY. GRIEF AT THIS STAGE WAS CONSUMING, BUT NOT ALL-CONSUMING. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS A "NORMAL" PERSON AT ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME. AT THIS POINT IN MY JOURNEY AS A BEREAVED MOTHER, I WOULD SAY MOST WOULD CONSIDER ME A NORMAL, HAPPY, FUNCTIONING MOTHER/WIFE/WOMAN ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. MEANING, I GET ON WITH LIFE, TRYING TO ENJOY EVERYTHING I CAN, WHILE HONORING MY BABIES AND GIVING IN TO THE GRIEF WHEN NECESSARY.  I'LL NEVER BE AT 100% AGAIN - THERE IS TOO MUCH SCARRING.  29, 2015 COPYRIGHT 2015 SYS-CON MEDIA, INC. BUT I WORK EVERY DAY TO GET JUST ONE MORE PERCENT HEALED. MY SKIN IS THICKER AND FOR 11 MONTHS OF THE 12 PER YEAR, I AM SMILING AND ABLE TO GET ON WITH IT. THAT SINGLE MONTH IS VERY NEAR. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BODY...THE NEARING OF OCTOBER. I CAN FEEL THEIR BIRTHDAY APPROACHING; CAN ALMOST HEAR IT, TOUCH IT, SMELL IT. THE LEAVES BEGINNING TO TURN AND THE COOL MORNINGS ARE INDICATORS THAT THE MONTH OF MEMORIES SWIMS NEARER TO ME. I WELCOME THE MEMORIES OF THE TWO BEINGS I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING UP TILL THAT POINT, BUT ALSO SHRINK BACK IN PAIN. THIS WILL BE THE MONTH (ALSO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS), THAT I HAVE TO RELIVE MY KIDS DYING. IT'S THE MONTH I HAVE TO REMEMBER GIVING BIRTH, WHILE TEARS OF HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FALL DOWN MY FACE. IT'S FREAKING PAINFUL. BUT, IT'S BEARABLE. AND I WILL GET THROUGH IT JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, KEEP READING. I LOVED THE WAY THIS WRITER EXPRESSED LIFE AS A BEREAVED PARENT. *COPIED FROM STILL STANDING MAGAZINE* A QUESTION IM FREQUENTLY ASKED BY BEREAVED PARENTS IS, DOES ITEVERGET EASIER? THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES IS PALPABLE. I KNOW. I GET IT. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION STILL SCARES ME TOO BECAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EASIER FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT. AND IT WASNT LONG AGO THAT I WAS ASKING BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WERE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF GRIEF THAN I WAS THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. IM NOT SURE WHEN I STOPPED ASKING IT PROBABLY WHEN I REALIZED IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN. STRADDLING HEAVEN AND EARTH ISNT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE ASEASY. EASIERIS A TRICKY WORD WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING AS PERMANENTLY HORRIFIC AS CHILD LOSS. I  LIKE TO RESERVE THE WORDEASIERFOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING A NEW SKILL OVER TIME. EASIER IS A NICE LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEMEASURED.ITS ALSO A LOVELY LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT ARENT IRRETRIEVABLY LOST AND PERMANENTLY MISSING. FOREVER AND EVER. IM CERTAIN THE PROGRESS OF MOVING THROUGH THE UNCHARTED WATERS OF GRIEF AFTER THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS IMMEASURABLE. ITS ONE STEP FORWARD, FOUR STEPS BACK. ITS TREADING WATER, WITH YOUR HEAD SLIGHTLY ABOVE, UNTIL YOURE NOT. ITS SWIMMING ALONG, THEN DROWNING WITHOUT NOTICE. ITS NOT LINEAR. I WILL REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT GRIEF. WHETHER IN A DAY, A YEAR, OR A LIFETIME GRIEF ISNOTLINEAR. EVEN STILL, SEVEN YEARS LATER, I THINK IM SAILING ALONGOK,THEN ALL OF A SUDDENSMACKOUT OF NOWHERE GRIEF BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. SOMETIMES IT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF A STRATEGICALLY PLACED GORGEOUS NINE YEAR OLD, BLUE-EYED LITTLE BOY WHO SHOULD BE MY LIVING BREATHING OLDEST SON, BUT WHO OBVIUSLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER MOTHER WHO IS CALLING AFTER HIM; SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM THE MISSING PUZZLE PIECE OF MY HEART THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF MY SON THAT STARTS OOZING UNCONTROLLABLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND TEARS LEAK OUT OF MY EYES WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. SOMETIMES ITS THE SIMPLE, ALMOST-PERFECT MOMENTS WITH MY 2/3RDS CHILDREN, THAT SMACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD AND ROB MY LUNGS OF PROPER BREATH. BREATHE,I GASP.BREATHE. THE THING ABOUT LIFE AFTER LOSS IS THAT NO MATTER WHATSOMEONE IS ALWAYS MISSING.NO MATTER WHAT, MY FAMILY IS ALWAYS ACHINGLYINCOMPLETE.I COULD HAVE FOUR MORE CHILDREN, AND THESE FACTS WOULD STILL REMAIN, STARING ME DOHWN LIKE A CRUEL BULLY WHO WILL TORMENT ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT BACK. THE REALITY OF CHILD LOSS IS THAT THE WRONG CAN NEVER BE MADE RIGHT. IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED. EVER. LIFE IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN WITHOUT OUR LIING, BREATHING CHILD(REN) IN IT. LIFE WILL NEVER FEEL A-OKAY AGAIN. SURE IT WILL HAVE MOMENTS OF BITTERSWEET JOY, AND BITTERSWEET HAPPINESS, AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LAUGH AGAIN, AND FIND STUPID THINGS FUNNY, BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE WHAT ITONCE WAS. THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THAT TWITTERPATED FEELING OF HAPPINESS THE KIND THAT FEELS NAIVE NOW, THE KIND YOU WONDER IF EVER EXISTED AT ALL? YOU MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. YOU CANT FIX IT, MEND IT, OR EVEN CRY IT AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS GO BY,THE ACHE REMAINS. SO BACK TOTHEQUESTION DOES IT EVER GET EASIER? THE HARD TRUTH IS A RESOUNDINGNO. NOT FOR ME, ANYWAY. IT HASNT GOTTENEASIERTO LIVE WITHOUT A HUGE PIECE OF MY HEART. GRIEF IS ALWAYS THERE, LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WALK THIS EARTH WITHOUT MY SON.  IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE NORMAL ANSWERS TO NORMAL QUESTIONS ANYMORE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS LIVING IN THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, SOUND LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OF GRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN HARD. WHETHER YOURE A DAY IN, OR 20 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO HARD. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD,  OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION. SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD. AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE CAN HONOR OUR PRECIOUS CHILD WITH EVERY BREATH WE TAKE. WE CAN AND WILL BE HAPPY AGAINANDIM GUESSING IT WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS FEEL DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT OUR CHILD. WE LIVEANDWE  GRIEVE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER, IT JUST BECOMESDIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT CALL THAT PESSIMISM, BUT FOR ME, ITSTRUTH. ITS SIMPLY THE REALITY OF BEREAVED PARENTHOOD. NOTE: GRIEF IS AS UNIQUE AS EACH PERSONS FINGERPRINT. IVE MET PLENTY OF BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WOULD SAY A RESOUNDING YES, GRIEF DOES GET EASIER OVER TIME. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR THEM. EASIER JUST ISNT THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. EACH PERSONS EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARNE DIFFERENT. NO TWO PEOPLE GRIEVE THE SAME. AND OUR JOB IS TO MEET EVERYONES EXPERIENCE/REALITY WITH UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT AND LOVE.

90	WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY OFF AT HOME MAKES! THE GIANTS RETURNED FROM A 10 GAME ROAD TRIP WITH THEIR TAILS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS. AFTER A DAY OFF, THEY SHOWED UP AT AT&T PARK ALL BRIGHT EYED AND BUSY TAILED AGAIN AND TOOK IT TO THE PADRES WITH NICE PITCHING FROM JAKE PEAVY, SOLID DEFENSE AND A PERSISTENT OFFENSIVE ATTACK THAT WORE DOWN PADRES STARTER ANDREW CASHNER. KEY LINES: ANGEL PAGAN- 1 FOR 5. BA= .261. PAGAN HAD JUST ONE HIT IN THE GAME, BUT IT DROVE IN THE FIRST RUN. HE ALSO MADE A SPECTACULAR CATCH ABOVE THE CF WALL TO ROB MATT KEMP OF A HR. PAGAN IS A BIT OF A POLARIZING PLAYER, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MEASURING HIS DEFENSE, BUT WHEN HE IS FULLY HEALTHY, WHICH HE FINALLY APPEARS TO BE, HE CAN MAKE SPECTACULAR PLAYS. LOOK UP THE VIDEO ON THIS ONE! MATT DUFFY- 2 FOR 4, BB. BA= .300. NOBODY GRINDS OUT AB'S LIKE THE DUFFMAN AND HE USES THE ENTIRE FIELD. IN THIS ONE, HE PULLED A SINGLE THROUGH THE HOLE BETWEEN 3'RD AND SHORT AND ANOTHER WHERE HE POKED ONE INTO RF. AFTER CASHNER OPENED THE GAME WITH TWO QUICK K'S ON PAGAN AND DE AZA, DUFFY WORKED HIM FOR THE FIRST OF 2 WALKS WHICH PUSHED UP HIS PITCH COUNT AND SET THE STAGE FOR THE GRIND DOWN. MARLON BYRD- 3 FOR 4, BB. BA= .248. HAS BYRD ALREADY BOUGHT INTO THE GIANTS HITTING PHILOSOPHY? HE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN KEEPING THE LINE MOVING LATELY. KELBY TOMLINSON- 1 FOR 5, 2 SB(4). BA= .298. TOMLINSON HIT INTO 3 FC'S BUT STOLE 2 BASES AND SCORED 3 RUNS. HE HAS MULTIPLE WAYS TO BEAT YOU. EHIRE ADRIANZA- 2 FOR 3, 2 BB. BA= .168. NICE GAME AT THE PLATE FOR ADRIANZA WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE MORE TO TAKE DOWN CASHNER THAN ANY OTHER HITTER IN THE LINEUP. HE ALSO MADE SEVERAL TOUGH PLAYS AT SS LOOK VERY EASY. JARRETT PARKER- 1 FOR 1, 2B. BA= .200. PARKER CAME UP LATE AS A PH AND HIT A BOMB TO THE WARNING TRACK IN TRIPLES ALLEY THAT BOUNCED WAY UP INTO THE STANDS FOR A GROUND RULE DOUBLE. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE LOUDEST DOUBLE I'VE EVER SEEN! FUN TO WATCH! JAKE PEAVY- 7 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 0 BB, 2 K'S. ERA= 4.15. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE JUST 2 K'S IN HIS BOXSCORE LINE. IT SEEMED LIKE HE PITCHED BETTER THAN THAT. HIS STUFF LOOKED CRISP AND HE WAS LOCATING WELL. NICE RHYTHM. HE DID BENEFIT FROM SOME NICE FIELDING PLAYS INCLUDING PAGAN'S CATCH, BUT GOT MOSTLY WEAK CONTACT AND KEPT HIS PITCH COUNT WAY DOWN. CORY GEARRIN- 0.2 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 1 K. ERA= 0.00. GEARRIN LOOKED ABSOLUTELY FIERCE AGAINST THE 2 BATTERS HE FACED. VERY NASTY LOOKING SLIDER. HE'S PITCHING TO STAY ON THE 40 MAN ROSTER THROUGH THE OFFSEASON AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO WIN A BULLPEN SPOT IN THE SPRING. BRETT BOCHY- 1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 1 K. ERA= 0.00. YOUNG BOCH GOT TO PITCH THE 9'TH INNING. HE SHOWED A BELOW AVERAGE FB BUT WITH GOOD COMMAND AND GOOD SECONDARY STUFF. HE GOT A VISIT TO THE MOUND FROM HIS POP AFTER ALLOWING A SINGLE TO MATT KEMP AND HBP TO UPTON. THE CROWD HAD SOME FUN WITH IT CHANTING BOCHY! BOCHY! BOCHY! AS HE STRUCK OUT THE FINAL BATTER OF THE GAME. MADISON BUMGARNER FACES IAN KENNEDY TODAY IN GAME 2 OF THE SERIES.
91	AT THE UNVEILING OF HIS TAX PLAN MONDAY, DONALD TRUMP DEPLOYED A THOROUGHLY DEBUNKED STATISTIC ABOUT THE AMERICAN JOBS MARKET. THE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, HE CLAIMED, IS SOMEWHERE NEAR 42 PERCENT. WHAT ABOUT THE THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SAID WAS 5.1 PERCENT FOR LAST MONTH ? THAT NUMBER, TRUMP SAID, IS THE BIGGEST JOKE THERE IS IN THIS COUNTRY. IN AUGUST, TRUMP MADE THE SAME STATEMENT TO TIME MAGAZINE . I SAW A CHART THE OTHER DAY, OUR REAL UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NINETY MILLION PEOPLE THAT ARENT WORKING. NINETY-THREE MILLION TO BE EXACT," HE SAID. WHATEVER CHART THAT WAS, TRUMP WAS READING ITWRONG. AND HES BEEN CALLED ON HIS ERROR REPEATEDLY . MY COLLEAGUE GLENN KESSLER WROTE A THOROUGH TAKEDOWN AT THE TIME, POINTING OUT THAT TRUMP WAS LUMPING TOGETHER RETIREES, STUDENTS, STAY-AT-HOME MOMS, AND ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARENT FIGURED INTO THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BECAUSE THEY ARENT AVAILABLE TO WORK. IT DOESNT SEEM THAT TRUMP WAS PAYING ATTENTION, SO WERE GOING TO TRY AGAIN WITH CHARTS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE LAST YEAR WAS, ON AVERAGE, 6.2 PERCENT, WHICH REFLECTS ABOUT 9.6 MILLION UNEMPLOYED OUT OF 156 MILLION IN THE CIVILIAN LABOR FORCE (PEOPLE READY AND ABLETO WORK, OR ACTIVELY LOOKING). TO BE OFFICIALLY UNEMPLOYED IN AMERICA, YOU HAVE TO HAVE LOOKED FOR WORK WITHIN THE PAST MONTH. NOW, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE STOPPED LOOKING FOR WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO DISCOURAGED BY THE CRAPPY ECONOMY. BUT MOST PEOPLE WHO AREN'T SEEKING EMPLOYMENT ARE BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS: LEARNING TO WALK, GOING TO SCHOOL, STAYING AT HOME TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN, TAKING A BREATHER FROM WORK, RETIRING TO THE GOOD LIFE. THIS CHART BREAKS IT DOWN: TRUMP MAY HAVE SEEN THAT 92 MILLIONFIGURE ON A CHART SOMEWHERE. AND ITS TRUE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARENT LOOKING FOR WORK. BUT THATS NOT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND WORK THEY WANT. AS NOTED ABOVE, MOST OF THEM HAVE A PRETTY GOOD REASON NOT TO WORK. OF THOSE 92 MILLION PEOPLE OVER 16 WHO WEREN'T LOOKING FOR WORK IN 2014, 86 MILLION (93 PERCENT) DID NOT WANT A JOB RIGHT THEN, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT SURVEYS. HERE ARE A FEW MORE DETAILS ON HOW THAT GROUP OF AMERICANS BREAKS DOWN: WITHOUT IDENTIFYING ANY ONE IN PARTICULAR, TRUMP SAID MONDAY THAT SOME GREAT ECONOMISTS HAVE PUT THE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 30 PERCENT, 32 PERCENT. HE THEN SAID THE NUMBER MIGHT EVEN BE 42 PERCENT, SAYING THAT'S "THE HIGHEST I'VE HEARD." THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO A 42 PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD BE TO COUNT EVERYONE'S GRANDMAS AND STAY-AT-HOME SPOUSES AS UNEMPLOYED. TO TAKE THIS KIND OF THINKING TO ITS LOGICAL EXTREME, CONSIDER THAT ONLY 146 MILLION OF AMERICA'S 319 MILLION WERE EMPLOYED IN 2014. MORE THAN HALF OF AMERICANS DID NOT HAVE JOBS (IN PART BECAUSE THEY WERE TEETHING). MAYBE THE REAL REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SHOULD BE54 PERCENT? OF COURSE NOT. BUT TRUMP IS CORRECT IN HIS SUSPICION THAT THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBER DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY. OF THE 92 MILLION AMERICANS WHO DIDN'T HAVE JOBS IN 2014, 6 MILLION WANTED A JOB BUT HADN'T BEEN LOOKING RECENTLY. THEY WEREN'T COUNTED IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, SINCE, WELL, THEY WEREN'T LOOKING. THE REASONS VARIED: SOME WENT BACK TOSCHOOL OR BECAME OCCUPIED WITH FAMILY MATTERS. SOME SIMPLY GAVE UP ON FINDING A JOB. THAT LAST CATEGORY DISCOURAGED WORKERS MAY BE WHAT TRUMP WAS REFERRING IN HIS SPEECH MONDAY. HE SAID, WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AND LOOK AND LOOK AND THEN THEY GIVE UP LOOKING FOR A JOB, THEY'RE TAKEN OFF THE ROLLS. THE SCALE OF THE DISCOURAGED-WORKER PROBLEM, THOUGH, IS MUCH SMALLER THAN TRUMP APPEARS TO BELIEVE. IN AUGUST, THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES THAT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 624,000 DISCOURAGED WORKERS FAR FROM 92 MILLION. THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS REPORTS AN ALTERNATIVE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT INCLUDES DISCOURAGED WORKERS. THAT NUMBER WAS 5.5 PERCENT IN AUGUST, COMPARED WITH THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH WAS 5.1. THERES ANOTHER , BROADER MEASURE OF UNEMPLOYMENT THAT THROWS IN THE MARGINALLY ATTACHED ANYONE WHO LOOKED FOR A JOB IN THE PAST YEAR, BUT NOT WITHIN THE PAST FOUR WEEKS. THERE WERE ABOUT 1.8 MILLION OF THOSE IN AUGUST. ADDING THEM TO THE MIX BUMPS UP THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO 6.2 PERCENT. FINALLY, THE MOST EXPANSIVE WAY THE GOVERNMENT MEASURES UNEMPLOYMENT ALSO FIGURES IN PART-TIME WORKERS WHO CANT FIND FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT. THERE WERE 6.3 MILLION OF THOSE IN AUGUST, AND THEY BRING THE RATE UP TO 10.3 PERCENT. ALL OF THESE NUMBERS PRESENT A USEFUL WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THOSE WHO WANT TO WORK IN AMERICA. THE NUMBER 42 PERCENT? THATS NOT THE ANSWER TO ANYTHING. JEFF GUO IS A STAFF WRITER FOR STORYLINE. HE'S FROM MARYLAND (BUT OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY). FOLLOW HIM ON TWITTER: @_JEFFGUO .

PHOTO: BOB LUCKEY JR. / HEARST CONNECTICUT MEDIA 25 YEARS OF FINDING THE RIGHT BOOK IN GREENWICH BACK TO GALLERY DIANE GARRETT BELIEVES THE SECRET TO BUSINESS SUCCESS IS SIMPLE. ITS ONE CUSTOMER AT A TIME, GARRETT SAID. NO BELLS AND WHISTLES. GARRETT IS CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF HER STORE, DIANES BOOKS, THIS YEAR. ITS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR THE CANADA NATIVE WHO WAS SHOCKED WHEN SHE REALIZED THERE WAS NO CHILDRENS BOOK STORE IN TOWN WHEN SHE MOVED TO GREENWICH THREE DECADES AGO. I COULDNT BELIEVE THAT IN THIS FABULOUS TOWN THERE WAS NO CHILDRENS BOOKSTORE, GARRETT SAID. THERE WERE OTHER BOOKSTORES BUT NONE FOR CHILDREN AND I BELIEVE IF WHOLE FAMILIES DONT READ WE DONT RAISE READERS, SO I KNEW THERE WAS A VOID IN TOWN. GARRETT, WHO HAS A MASTERS IN LIBRARY SCIENCE, SAID SHE WAS TOLD MORE THAN ONCE SHE WAS CRAZY FOR WANTING TO OPEN A BOOKSTORE, BUT SHE HAD A PLAN FOR THE FAMILY BOOKSTORE AND WASNT ABOUT TO GIVE UP. SHE OPENED THE STORE ON GRIGG STREET, JUST OFF GREENWICH AVENUE, ON NOV. 3. SHE WANTED THE STORE TO BE A SPECIAL PLACE FOR CUSTOMERS TO CELEBRATE BOOKS, AND SHE WANTED EVERYONE IN HER STORE TO BE AN EXPERT IN SOME WAY IN ORDER TO HELP PEOPLE FIND THE PERFECT BOOK. THE FOUR CS COMPASSION, CURIOSITY, COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ARE THE RULES BY WHICH SHE RUNS HER BUSINESS, GARRETT SAID. EARLIER THIS YEAR, DIANE WAS AWARDED THE MALCOLM S. PRAY EXCELLENCE IN BUSINESS AWARD BY THE GREENWICH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE . THE TWO YEAR OLD AWARD IS GIVEN TO BUSINESS OWNERS WHO DO A LOT OF COMMUNITY SERVICE. WINNING THE AWARD, GARRETT SAID, WAS A GREAT WAY TO KICK OFF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION. THE TIMING WAS GREAT, GARRETT SAID. ITS A GREAT THING TO BE HERE 25 YEARS AND STILL BE HAVING SO MUCH FUN, AND THE BOOKS JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER. JEANNIE GILLESPIE HAS WORKED FOR GARRETT FOR 10 YEARS AND SAID GARRETTS EXPERTISE AND PASSION ARE WHAT MAKES THE STORE SUCCESSFUL AND A GREAT PLACE TO WORK. SHES A TOWN TREASURE, GILLESPIE SAID. SHE REALLY ADDS THAT PERSONAL TOUCH AND PEOPLE TRUST HER OPINION. I WORKED ON THE PUBLISHING SIDE AND BOOKSTORES ARE PART OF THE PUBLISHING ECOSYSTEM. DIANE IS PRETTY SPECIAL TO BE A PART OF THAT. KRISTIN MURPHY , 24, HAS BEEN A LOYAL DIANES BOOKS CUSTOMER THROUGHOUT HER LIFE. EVEN THOUGH SHES GONE OFF TO COLLEGE AND HAS MOVED TO RHODE ISLAND, SHE STILL MAKES A POINT TO STOP IN THE STORE ANYTIME SHES BACK IN GREENWICH. SHE SAID SHE PLANS TO COME BACK TO GREENWICH TO VISIT FOR THE WEEKEND OF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION. I HAVE A VERY DISTINCT MEMORY OF BUYING FERDINAND THE BULL AT DIANES AND TAKING IT TO MY FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN, MURPHY SAID. ITS JUST A REALLY SPECIAL PLACE, ESPECIALLY THE CHILDRENS SECTION. I STILL GO TO DIANES FOR RECOMMENDATIONS AND TO VISIT WHENEVER IM IN TOWN. THE STAFF IS JUST AMAZING. ITS A MAGICAL PLACE. OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS, DIANES BOOKS HAS EXPANDED FOUR TIMES AS THE BOOK BUSINESS HAS EVOLVED AND THE PUBLISHING WORLD HAS CONTINUED PUTTING OUT MORE AND MORE BOOKS. GARRETT SAID THE STORE USED TO HOST READINGS BUT DUE TO THE EXPANDED INVENTORY THEY SIMPLY DONT HAVE THE SPACE ANYMORE AND THE READINGS ARE HOSTED ELSEWHERE. BUT THE MEMORIES OF THOSE EARLY READINGS ARE CONTAINED IN THE WALLS OF DIANES WHERE SHE HAD VISITING AUTHORS SIGN THEIR NAME. GARRETT AND HER STAFF AT DIANES BOOKS WHO SHE REFERS TO AS DIANES DAZZLING DIVAS WILL CELEBRATE THE LANDMARK ANNIVERSARY ON HALLOWEEN, AS THEY HAVE FOR THEIR 15TH AND 20TH ANNIVERSARIES. THEY HAVE PLANS TO DRESS UP AND INVITE THE COMMUNITY TO CELEBRATE WITH THEM. THERE WILL BE A PARTY WITH FACE PAINTING AND RAFFLES, AND OF COURSE, GEARED TOWARD THE KIDS FOR WHOM SHE STARTED IT ALL. SURVIVING 25 YEARS JUST OFF THE EVER-CHANGING GREENWICH AVENUE IS NO SMALL FEAT FOR A SMALL BUSINESS, BUT GARRETT SAID SHE HAS NO PLANS TO MOVE THE STORE OR RETIRE ANYTIME SOON. I PLAN TO BE HERE UNTIL I CANT ANYMORE, GARRETT SAID. I JUST LOVE WHAT I DO. KKRASSELT@SCNI.COM; 203-625-4411; TWITTER: @KAITLYNKRASSELT

95	ON AUG 31, WE ISSUED AN UPDATED RESEARCH REPORT ON PAINTS AND COATINGS MAKER VALSPAR ( VAL - ANALYST REPORT ). VALSPAR SAW HIGHER PROFITS IN THIRD-QUARTER FISCAL 2015 (ENDED JUL 31, 2015) ON THE BACK OF SOLID COMMERCIAL EXECUTION AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER SURPASSED THE ZACKS CONSENSUS ESTIMATE WHILE REVENUES LAGGED THE SAME. THE COMPANY RAISED THE LOWER END OF ITS EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2015. VALSPAR HAS A BROAD PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHARE GAINS IN BOTH ITS PAINTS AND COATINGS SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY SHOULD CONTINUE TO GAIN FROM NEW BUSINESS WINS, INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH INITIATIVES AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. WINNING NEW BUSINESSES REMAIN A COMPANY-WIDE FOCUS THAT WILL POSITION VALSPAR WELL FOR THE FUTURE. THE ACQUISITION OF PAINT MANUFACTURING ASSETS OF ACE HARDWARE HAS REINFORCED VALSPAR RETAIL FOOTHOLD IN THE U.S. MOREOVER, VALSPAR HAS STRENGTHENED ITS POSITION IN THE $6 BILLION EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MARKET WITH THE TAKEOVER OF ITALY-BASED INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MAKER INVER HOLDING S.R.L. THE PURCHASE OF QUEST SPECIALTY CHEMICALS PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESSES HAS ALSO STRENGTHENS VALSPAR'S FOOTHOLD IN THE ATTRACTIVE AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH MARKET. THE COMPANY IS LOOKING TO BOOST SALES WITH THE INTEGRATION OF QUEST CHEMICALS. THE ACQUISITION ADDED 6% TO PAINTS SEGMENTS SALES IN THE THIRD QUARTER. IN ADDITION, VALSPARS PAINT BUSINESS IS ALSO BENEFITING FROM CONTINUED ROLLOUT OF VALSPAR BRANDED PRODUCTS AT ACE HARDWARE. MOREOVER, VALSPAR RESERVE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR PAINTS ARE ALSO DRIVING SALES IN THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CHANNEL. VALSPAR IS AGGRESSIVELY INVESTING IN PROMOTING THIS PRODUCT. VALSPAR IS ALSO MANAGING ITS COST WELL AND MAINTAINING A COST STRUCTURE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CURRENT EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. IT ALSO REMAINS COMMITTED TO BOOST SHAREHOLDER RETURN LEVERAGING HEALTHY CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, VALSPAR FACES CURRENCY HEADWINDS, STEMMING FROM A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR. UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY SWINGS REDUCED ITS SALES BY 5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER. CURRENCY HEADWIND IS EXPECTED WEIGH ON ITS SALES FOR FISCAL 2015. THE COMPANY NOW SEES ITS REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2015 TO FALL IN THE MID SINGLE-DIGITS YEAR OVER YEAR VERSUS A LOW SINGLE-DIGITS DECLINE EXPECTED EARLIER. WE ALSO ACCOUNT FOR VOLATILITY IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS. VALSPAR HAS EXPERIENCED DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLIES OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT VARIOUS TIMES, IMPACTING ITS ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS.

96	ENGLEWOOD, COLO. (AP) STILL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS AND A RHYTHM ON OFFENSE, PEYTON MANNING AT LEAST FOUND HIS FUNNY BONE. THE BRONCOS PUZZLED PASSER MET THE MEDIA AT HIS LOCKER TUESDAY WITH A CAREFREE SMILE AND BOUNCED BACK FROM AN ICY POST-GAME PERFORMANCE THAT FOLLOWED THE BRONCOS 19-13 VICTORY OVER BALTIMORE, ONE THAT INCLUDED NONE OF THE USUAL OFFENSIVE FIREWORKS. HOUNDED FIRST BY THE BOO-BIRDS WHEN THE BRONCOS RAN JUST ONE RED ZONE PLAY AND THEN BY REPORTERS, MANNING WAS ACERBIC AFTER STRETCHING HIS STREAK TO 21 DRIVES, INCLUDING THE PRESEASON, WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN CELEBRATION. THIS TIME, HE DELIVERED A FEW FUNNY LINES AND DEFLECTED TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS STILL-EVOLVING OFFENSE OF BLENDED CONCEPTS WITH A TOUCH OF HUMOR.  AFTER THE CO-HOSTS' COMMENTS ABOUT NURSES ON MONDAY LED TO OUTRAGE AND THE EVENTUAL LOSS OF TWO MAJOR ADVERTISERS , THE ABC DAYTIME TALK SHOW RESPONDED ON FRIDAY WITH A SHOW BASICALLY DEVOTED TO CELEBRATING NURSING. ASKED ABOUT LANDING ON THE INJURY REPORT WITH A SORE BACK COURTESY OF ALL THOSE HARD HITS FROM THE RAVENS, MANNING DECIDED TO DELIVER HIS OWN EVALUATION OF THOSE ASKING ALL THE QUESTIONS. THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY GROUP, BY ANY MEANS, MANNING CRACKED. THIS ONE SURELY HAS GOUT. BUNIONS, THAT ONE.  AND THE DRIVE-TIME RADIO HOST, HES GOT LARYNGITIS FROM RIPPING ME ALL WEEK PLUS THE RASH THAT HE HAS THATS UNIDENTIFIED. BUT I NEVER HEAR YOU GUYS COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, SO IM NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. IN MANY WAYS, YOU GUYS INSPIRE ME, MANNING DEAD-PANNED. BUT, NO, I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT I WAS ON IT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. BUT I THINK LIKE A LOT OF GUYS, IT WAS A PRETTY PHYSICAL GAME ON SUNDAY.  I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES AROUND HERE THAT WE DID ACTUALLY WIN THE GAME AND THAT WE ARE 6-2. THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE I CANT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE HAD WE LOST THE GAME, MANNING SAID. THE OFFENSE, WHICH INCLUDES FOUR NEW LINEMEN, DID DO SOME GOOD THINGS SUNDAY, LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER AN 11-MINUTE FOURTH-QUARTER DRIVE THAT LED TO BRANDON MCMANUSS FOURTH FIELD GOAL. IM SURE OFFENSIVELY I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF GUYS THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO PLAY BETTER. I FEEL LIKE THAT THURSDAY PROBABLY COULDNT COME SOON ENOUGH, MANNING SAID. THE BRONCOS PLAY AT KANSAS CITY (2-1), WHERE A VICTORY WOULD GIVE MANNING AND THE BRONCOS A RECORD 13TH CONSECUTIVE DIVISIONAL ROAD WIN. FIRST THINGS FIRST. FINDING THE END ZONE IS PRIORITY NO. 1 FOR A TEAM THAT JUST TWO YEARS AGO BECAME THE FIRST IN NFL HISTORY TO CRACK THE 600-POINT BARRIER WHEN MANNING THREW FOR A RECORD 55 TOUCHDOWNS. SOMETIMES THE BEST MEDICINE IS TO GET BACK OUT THERE AND PLAY AS SOON AS YOU CAN, MANNING SAID. AND, AS HE SHOWED TUESDAY, SOMETIMES LAUGHTERS THE BEST TONIC, TOO.  A GUY HAS TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD AND SEEN, AFTER ALL. NOTES: ILB BRANDON MARSHALL SAID ONE OF THE SCREWS IN HIS SURGICALLY REPAIRED RIGHT FOOT HAS BROKEN, BUT HELL TRY TO DEAL WITH THE DISCOMFORT UNTIL AFTER THE SEASON BECAUSE SURGERY TO REMOVE IT WOULD REQUIRE A TWO-MONTH RECOVERY. S DARIAN STEWART (GROIN) GOT HURT ON THE PLAY BEFORE HIS GAME-WINNING INTERCEPTION SUNDAY, SOMETHING COACH GARY KUBIAK DIDNT LEARN UNTIL WATCHING CB AQIB TALIB, WHO WAS MICD UP FOR THE GAME, ON THE TEAMS WEBSITE.

97	BALLACHULISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL SECRETARY DAVE KITSON OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE'S RBS BRANCH.  1:2-4 THEIR PURPOSE  IS TO TEACH PEOPLE WISDOM AND DISCIPLINE,TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE INSIGHTS OF THE WISETO TEACH PEOPLE TO LIVE DISCIPLINED AND SUCCESSFUL LIVES,TO HELP THEM DO WHAT IS RIGHT, JUST, AND FAIR. PICTURE: IAIN FERGUSON, THE WRITE IMAGE A LOCHABER COMMUNITY IS FIGHTING TO SAVE ITS LOCAL BANKING SERVICE AFTER LEARNING THAT ITS BRANCH IS TO CLOSE AND BE REPLACED WITH A MOBILE BAN. PEOPLE LIVING IN THE BALLACHULISH AREA WERE SHOCKED AND DISAPPOINTED TO DISCOVER THAT RBS AS PLANNING TO CLOSE ITS BRANCH IN THE VILLAGE. THE MOVE FOLLOWS THE CLOSURE OF THE RBS BRANCH IN KINLOCHLEVEN IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, WHICH WAS ALSO OPPOSED BY LOCALS. BOTH CLOSURES HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO FALLING CUSTOMER NUMBERS DUE TO MORE PEOPLE USING ONLINE AND MOBILE BANKING. THE BANK SAID THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AT THE BALLACHULISH BRANCH HAD DROPPED BY 26 PER CENT SINCE 2011, WITH ONLY 13 CUSTOMERS USING THE BRANCH ON A REGULAR WEEKLY BASIS. A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE BANK  SAID: WE HAVE TAKEN THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO CLOSE THE RBS BALLACHULISH BRANCH ON DECEMBER 7, 9515.  SHE ADDED THAT THEY WOULD BE INTRODUCING A MOBILE BRANCH SERVICE AND CUSTOMERS WOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS AT THE LOCAL POST OFFICE. THE SPOKESWOMAN ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE FORT WILLIAM BRANCH AND EIGHT FREE TO USE ATMS WERE WITHIN 15 MILES OF BALLACHULISH. BALLACHULISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL CHAIRMAN KEVIN SMITH SAID LOCALS WERE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE PROPOSED CLOSURE.  HE ADDED THAT THE FIGURES GIVEN FOR CUSTOMER USAGE AT THE BALLACHULISH BRANCH WERE SO LOW THAT THEY WERE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE. MR SMITH WROTE: YOU AE SAYING THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH FOOTFALL IN THE BANK, BUT AT ANYTIME I AM IN THERE IS A QUEUE. AND HE HAS ASKED THE BANK TO RESPOND TO A SERIES OF QUESTIONS INCLUDING HOW MANY CUSTOMERS RBS HAS IN THE BALLACHULISH AREA INCLUDING THOSE IN KINLOCHLEVEN, DUROR AND NETHER LOCHABER.  MR SMITH ALSO WANTS TO KNOW WHETHER THE MOBILE SERVICE WOULDCONTINUE THE CURRENT HOURS ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY MORNINGS, WHAT ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE MADE FOR QUEUING, ESPECIALLY IN BAD WEATHER, AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A PRIVATE ROOM FOR CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH TELLERS. FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES REGIONAL CHAIRWOMAN FOR THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS AMANDA FRAZER SAID: WHILE AROUND 75 PER CENT OF HIGHLANDSAND ISLANDS MEMBERS DO NOW BANK ONLINE, BRANCHES REMAIN VITAL, WITH 64 PER CENT OF MEMBERS  USING THEM FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY USE THEM FOR DEPOSITING CASH, BUT FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS AND CASH WITHDRAWALS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT.
98	MY OWN NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING BLOG POST/ARTICLE: "EASIER" IS THE WORD SHE IS CONTEMPLATING HERE. DOES LOSING A CHILD OR A MUCH WANTED PREGNANCY GET EASIER? I AGREE WITH "NO". IT GETS BEARABLE. THAT IS THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE ALMOST 4 YEARS OUT. THE DEFINITION OF BEARABLE IS: ABLE TO BE ENDURED, TOLERABLE. IT DIDN'T USED TO FEEL BEARABLE. I WOULD SAY THE GRIEF BECAME BEARABLE SOMETIME BETWEEN YEAR 1 AND 2. BEFORE THAT IT WASR ALL ACTIVE GRIEF. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS I WAS UTTERLY LOST AND CONSUMED BY THE LOSS OF MICHAEL AND ALENA - HAPPINESS FELT PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE. AT 3-6 MONTHS I WAS GETTING INTO THE TERRITORY OF WANTING HAPPINESS AGAIN; OF WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HEAVIEST KIND OF GRIEF WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND I BEGAN FEELING THE NEED TO PARENT MY LOST BABIES THROUGH ACTS. FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR, I WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO HEAL AND FIND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY. GRIEF AT THIS STAGE WAS CONSUMING, BUT NOT ALL-CONSUMING. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS A "NORMAL" PERSON AT ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME. AT THIS POINT IN MLY JOURNEY AS A BEREAVED MOTHER, I WOULD SAY MOST WOULD CONSIDER ME A NORMAL, HAPPY, FUNCTIONING MOTHER/WIFE/WOMAN ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. MEANING, I GET ON WITH LIFE, TRYING TO ENJOY EVERYTHING I CAN, WHILE HONORING MY BABIES AND GIVING IN TO THE GRIEF WHEN NECESSARY. THINGS ARE BEARABLE. I'LL NEVER BE AT 100% AGAIN - THERE IS TOO MUCH SCARRING. BUT I WORK EVERY DAY TO GET JUST ONE MORE PERCENT HEALED. MY SKIN IS THICKER AND FOR 11 MONTHS OF THE 12 PER YEAR, I AM SMILING AND ABLE TO GET ON WITH IT. THAT SINGLE MONTH IS VERY NEAR. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BODY...THE NEARING OF OCTOBER. I CAN FEEL THEIR BIRTHDAY APPROACHING; CAN ALMOST HEAR IT, TOUCH IT, SMELL IT. THE LEAVES BEGINNING TO TURN AND THE COOL MORNINGS ARE INDICATORS THAT THE MONTH OF MEMORIES SWIMS NEARER TO ME. I WELCOME THE MEMORIES OF THE TWO BEINGS I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHDING UP TILL THAT POINT, BUT ALSO SHRINK BACK IN PAIN. THIS WILL BE THE MONTH (ALSO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS), THAT I HAVE TO RELIVE MY KIDS DYING. IT'S THE MONTH I HAVE TO REMEMBER GIVING BIRTH, WHILE TEARS OF HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FALL DOWN MY FACE. IT'S FREAKING PAINFUL. BUT, IT'S BEARABLE. AND I WILL GET THROUGH IT JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, KEEP READING. I LOVED THE WAY THIS WRITER EXPRESSED LIFE AS A BEREAVED PARENT. *COPIED FROM STILL STANDING MAGAZINE* A QUESTION IM FREQUENTLY ASKED BY BEREAVED PARENTS IS, DOES ITEVERGET EASIER? THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES IS PALPABLE. I KNOW. I GET IT. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION STILL SCARES ME TOO BECAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EASIER FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT. AND IT WASNT LONG AGO THAT I WAS ASKING BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WERE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF GRIEF THAN I WAS THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. IM NOT SURE WHEN I STOPPED ASKING IT PROBABLY WHEN I REALIZED IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN. STRADDLING HEAVEN AND EARTH ISNT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE ASEASY. EASIERIS A TRICKY WORD WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING AS PERMANENTLY HORRIFIC AS CHILD LOSS. I LIKE TO RESERVE THE WORDEASIERFOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING A NEW SKILL OVER TIME. EASIER IS A NICE LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEMEASURED.ITS ALSO A LOVELY LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT ARENT IRRETRIEVABLY LOST AND PERMANENTLY MISSING. FOREVER AND EVER. IM CERTAIN THE PROGRESS OF MOVING THROUGH THE UNCHARTED WATERS OF GRIEF AFTER THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS IMMEASURABLE. ITS ONE STEP FORWARD, FOUR STEPS BACK. ITS TREADING WATER, WITH YOUR HEAD SLIGHTLY ABOVE, UNTIL YOURE NOT. ITS SWIMMING ALONG, THEN DROWNING WITHOUT NOTICE. ITS NOT LINEAR. I WILL REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT GRIEF. WHETHER IN A DAY, A YEAR, OR A LIFETIME GRIEF ISNOTLINEAR. EVEN STILL, SEVEN YEARS LATER, I THINK IM SAILING ALONGOK,THEN ALL OF A SUDDENSMACKOUT OF NOWHERE GRIEF BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. SOMETIMES IT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF A STRATEGICALLY PLACED GORGEOUS NINE YEAR OLD, BLUE-EYED LITTLE BOY WHO SHOULD BE MY LIVING BREATHING OLDEST SON, BUT WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER MOTHER WHO IS CALLING AFTER HIM; SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM THE MISSING PUZZLE PIECE OF MY HEART THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF MY SON THAT STARTS OOZING UNCONTROLLABLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND TEARS LEAK OUT OF MY EYES WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. SOMETIMES ITS THE SIMPLE, ALMOST-PERFECT MOMENTS WITH MY 2/3RDS CHILDREN, THAT SMACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD AND ROB MY LUNGS OF PROPER BREATH. BREATHE,I GASP.BREATHE. THE THING ABOUT LIFE AFTER LOSS IS THAT NO MATTER WHATSOMEONE IS ALWAYS MISSING.NO MATTER WHAT, MY FAMILY IS ALWAYS ACHINGLYINCOMPLETE.I COULD HAVE FOUR MORE CHILDREN, AND THESE FACTS WOULD STILL REMAIN, STARING ME DOWN LIKE A CRUEL BULLY WHO WILL TORMENT ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT BACK. THE REALITY OF CHILD LOSS IS THAT THE WRONG CAN NEVER BE MADE RIGHT. IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED. EVER. LIFE IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN WITKHOUT OUR LIVING, BREATHING CHILD(REN) IN IT. LIFE WILL NEVER FEEL A-OKAY AGAIN. SURE IT WILL HAVE MOMENTS OF BITTERSWEET JOY, AND BITTERSWEET HAPPINESS, AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LAUGH AGAIN, AND FIND STUPID THINGS FUNNY, BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE WHAT ITONCE WAS. THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THAT TWITTERPATED FEELING OF HAPPINESS THE KIND THAT FEELS NAIVE NOW, THE KIND YOU WONDER IF EVER EXISTED AT ALL? YOU MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. YOU CANT FIX IT, MEND IT, OR EVEN CRY IT AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS GO BY,THE ACHE REMAINS.  THE HARD TRUTH IS A RESOUNDINGNO. NOT FOR ME, ANYWAY. IT HASNT GOTTENEASIERTO LIVE WITHOUT A HUGE PIECE OF MY HEART. GRIEF IS ALWAYS THERE, LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WALK THIS EARTH WITHOUT MY SON. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO BREATHE WHILE CHOKING ON AIR. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE NORMAL ANSWERS TO NORMAL QUESTIONS ANYMORE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS LIVING IN THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, SOUND LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OF GRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN HARD.  OH YOU WANT TO PLAY, HEINZ SAID. WHETHER YOURE A DAY IN, OR 20 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO HARD. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD, OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION. SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD.  ONCE THE SONG CONCLUDED AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT ALL MARRIVED COUPLES MUST REPORT TO THE DANCE FLOOR FOR A VERY SPECIAL TRIBUTE. AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP.

100	ON AUG 31, WE ISSUED AN UPDATED RESEARCH REPORT ON PAINTS AND COATINGS MAKER VALSPAR ( VAL - ANALYST REPORT ). VALSPAR SAW HIGHER PROFITS IN THIRD-QUARTER FISCAL 2015 (ENDED JUL 31, 2015) ON THE BACK OF SOLID COMMERCIAL EXECUTION AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER SURPASSED THE ZACKS CONSENSUS ESTIMATE WHILE REVENUES LAGGED THE SAME. THE COMPANY RAISED THE LOWER END OF ITS EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2015. VALSPAR HAS A BROAD PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHARE GAINS IN BOTH ITS PAINTS AND COATINGS SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY SHOULD CONTINUE TO GAIN FROM NEW BUSINESS WINS, INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH INITIATIVES AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. WINNING NEW BUSINESSES REMAIN A COMPANY-WIDE FOCUS THAT WILL POSITION VALSPAR WELL FOR THE FUTURE. THE ACQUISITION OF PAINT MANUFACTURING ASSETS OF ACE HARDWARE HAS REINFORCED VALSPAR RETAIL FOOTHOLD IN THE U.S. MOREOVER, VALSPAR HAS STRENGTHENED ITS POSITION IN THE $6 BILLION EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MARKET WITH THE TAKEOVER OF ITALY-BASED INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MAKER INVER HOLDING S.R.L. THE PURCHASE OF QUEST SPECIALTY CHEMICALS PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESSES HAS ALSO STRENGTHENS VALSPAR'S FOOTHOLD IN THE ATTRACTIVE AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH MARKET. THE COMPANY IS LOOKING TO BOOST SALES WITH THE INTEGRATION OF QUEST CHEMICALS. THE ACQUISITION ADDED 6% TO PAINTS SEGMENTS SALES IN THE THIRD QUARTER. IN ADDITION, VALSPARS PAINT BUSINESS IS ALSO BENEFITING FROM CONTINUED ROLLOUT OF VALSPAR BRANDED PRODUCTS AT ACE HARDWARE. MOREOVER, VALSPAR RESERVE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR PAINTS ARE ALSO DRIVING SALES IN THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CHANNEL. VALSPAR IS AGGRESSIVELY INVESTING IN PROMOTING THIS PRODUCT. VALSPAR IS ALSO MANAGING ITS COST WELL AND MAINTAINING A COST STRUCTURE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CURRENT EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. IT ALSO REMAINS COMMITTED TO BOOST SHAREHOLDER RETURN LEVERAGING HEALTHY CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, VALSPAR FACES CURRENCY HEADWINDS, STEMMING FROM A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR. UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY SWINGS REDUCED ITS SALES BY 5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER. CURRENCY HEADWIND IS EXPECTED WEIGH ON ITS SALES FOR FISCAL 2015. THE COMPANY NOW SEES ITS REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2015 TO FALL IN THE MID SINGLE-DIGITS YEAR OVER YEAR VERSUS A LOW SINGLE-DIGITS DECLINE EXPECTED EARLIER. WE ALSO ACCOUNT FOR VOLATILITY IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS. VALSPAR HAS EXPERIENCED DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLIES OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT VARIOUS TIMES, IMPACTING ITS ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS. THE OVERALL DEMAND ENVIRONMENT ALSO REMAINS UNEVEN. VALSPAR CURRENTLY SPORTS A ZACKS RANK #3 (HOLD).
