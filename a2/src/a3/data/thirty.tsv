2	NORTH CARROLL HIGH SCHOOL HONORED ED POWELSON SIX YEARS AGO BY NAMING ITS STADIUM FIELD AFTER THE MAN WHO DEVOTED ALMOST ALL OF HIS ADULT LIFE TO HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS IN HAMPSTEAD, AND SEVERAL COUNTY SPORTS FIGURES ATTENDED THE CEREMONY. ONE OF THEM WAS GEORGE WUNDER, A 1992 NORTH CARROLL GRAD AND LONGTIME BASKETBALL COACH AT CENTURY HIGH. HE WANTED THE PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE TO KNOW HOW MUCH POWELSON IMPACTED HIS LIFE, AND MANY OTHERS, AS A COACH, ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, AND ROLE MODEL. "NO ONE EVER CARED ABOUT NORTH CARROLL MORE," WUNDER SAID THAT DAY, "THAN MR. POWELSON." LRELATED WESTMINSTERASCENSION EPISCOPAL CHURCH HOLDS BLESSING OF THE ANIMALSSEE ALL RELATED 8 POWELSON, ONE OF CARROLL COUNTY'S MORE RECOGNIZABLE SPORTS FIGURES, DIED SUNDAY AFTER A LONG BATTLE WITH CANCER. HE WAS 77. POWELSON COACHED BOYS SOCCER AT NORTH CARROLL FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS AND FINISHED HIS COACHING CAREER WITH 274 WINS THE MOST IN STATE HISTORY FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL COACH WHEN HE RETIRED IN 1995 TO GO WITH 46 COMBINED COUNTY, CONFERENCE AND REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS. HE WAS INDUCTED INTO THE CARROLL COUNTY SPORTS HALL OF FAME IN 2001, AND LATER THIS WEEK NORTH CARROLL WILL BEGIN ITS SEVENTH FALL SPORTS SEASON WITH GAMES PLAYED ON POWELSON FIELD. CCOMMENTS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY? START THE CONVERSATION AND BE THE FIRST TO COMMENT. ADD A COMMENT 0 TROY WAREHIME, NORTH CARROLL'S ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, SPOKE DURING A CEREMONY IN 2006 WHEN POWELSON BECAME THE FIRST MEMBER OF NC'S SPORTS HALL OF FAME. THREE YEARS LATER, HE SPOKE AGAIN AT THE POWELSON FIELD DEDICATION CEREMONY. WAREHIME IS PLANNING TO SAY SOME WORDS ABOUT POWELSON LATER THIS WEEK AT ONE OF POWELSON'S MEMORIAL SERVICES. "THIS TIME WON'T BE SO EASY," WAREHIME SAID.  'IT UPSET ME THAT HE PUT SOMEONE HE HAS SPENT SO LITTLE TIME WITH IN THE SAME FIELD AS MYSELF AND THE OTHER GIRLS,' SHE TOLD THE CAMERAS. "HE WAS MY HERO." POWELSON HAILED FROM RIDGELEY, WEST VIRGINIA, GRADUATED FROM FAIRMONT STATE COLLEGE IN 1959, AND CAME TO CARROLL COUNTY IN 1961, WHEN HE TOOK A JOB TEACHING PHYSICAL EDUCATION AT HAMPSTEAD ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS. HE DECLINED AN OFFER TO BECOME A PE TEACHER AT NORTH CARROLL HIGH THE FOLLOWING YEAR. WHEN IT WAS OFFERED AGAIN THE NEXT YEAR, HE ACCEPTED. "I FIGURED THEY WOULDN'T ASK THREE TIMES," POWELSON SAID IN A 1997 TIMES ARTICLE.  "BALTIMORE'S AN EXCELLENT DEFENSE. POWELSON COACHED TRACK AND FIELD, BASKETBALL, AND SOCCER TO START, THEN ADDED GYMNASTICS TO HIS RESUME. HE ALSO INHERITED ATHLETIC DIRECTOR DUTIES, EVEN THOUGH SUCH A POSITION DIDN'T REALLY EXIST BACK THEN. "I WAS THE ONLY COACH," POWELSON SAID IN THE 1997 ARTICLE. "AND YOU DID ALL THE SCHEDULING, YOU DID EVERYTHING, EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T CALLED ATHLETIC DIRECTORS AND WE DIDN'T GET PAID A CENT FOR ANY OF IT, WHICH WAS FINE. "THAT WASN'T A PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT WASN'T WHY YOU GET IN TEACHING OR COACHING. YOU WERE IN IT FOR THE LOVE OF IT." POWELSON'S BOYS SOCCER TEAMS WON 20 COUNTY TITLES BETWEEN 1961 AND 1988 AND ENJOYED A 46-GAME WINNING STREAK. HE STEPPED AWAY FROM COACHING IN 1995, AND LEFT HIS POST AS ATHLETIC DIRECTOR IN 1997, WRAPPING UP A TEACHING AND COACHING CAREER THAT SPANNED FOUR DECADES. "HE TAUGHT KIDS, HE TAUGHT THEIR PARENTS, AND HE MIGHT HAVE TAUGHT A FEW OF THEIR GRANDPARENTS," WAREHIME SAID. POWELSON HELPED INTRODUCE THE ATHLETIC TRAINER PROGRAM TO CARROLL IN THE 1980S; HE HELPED FORM THE MONOCACY VALLEY ATHLETIC LEAGUE IN 1972 AND THE CENTRAL MARYLAND CONFERENCE IN THE '80S; AND HE WAS INDUCTED INTO THE MARYLAND STATE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR HALL OF FAME IN 1998. "THEY SORT OF BROKE THE MOLD WITH ED," SAID JIM RODRIGUEZ, CARROLL'S SUPERVISOR OF ATHLETICS, AT THE 2009 FIELD-NAMING CEREMONY. "IT'S ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE HE TOUCHED AND THE LIFE LESSONS HE GAVE THEM BEYOND THE FIELD." WHEN NORTH CARROLL'S FOOTBALL TEAM HAD THE FIRST HOME PLAYOFF CONTEST IN ITS HISTORY LAST FALL, POWELSON WAS ON HAND TO TAKE PART IN THE PRE-GAME COIN FLIP. HE WAS ALREADY INTO HIS FIGHT AGAINST PROSTATE CANCER AT THE TIME, BUT POWELSON RARELY MISSED A SPORTING EVENT AT EITHER NORTH CARROLL OR MANCHESTER VALLEY. HIS DAUGHTER, DENEAN KOONTZ, IS NORTH CARROLL'S FIELD HOCKEY COACH. HIS SON-IN-LAW, BERNIE KOONTZ, COACHES BASKETBALL AT MANCHESTER VALLEY. DENEAN KOONTZ SAID IT SERVED HER FATHER WELL DURING A DIFFICULT TIME BEING ABLE TO WATCH THE PANTHERS' FIELD HOCKEY TEAM WIN THE LAST TWO CLASS 1A STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS, WITH HIS GRANDDAUGHTER JENSYN KOONTZ AS A STANDOUT. "HE DOESN'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY," DENEAN KOONTZ SAID.  I THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT. "HE KEPT FIGHTING UNTIL THE DAY HE PASSED AWAY. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO MY FATHER ... WAS HIS FAMILY. FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THE PAST [FEW] YEARS WITH THEM, AND TO SEE ALL OF THOSE THINGS, WAS VERY, VERY SPECIAL."

3	BY ZHIQUN ZHU (CHINA DAILY USA) UPDATED: 2015-09-23 11:51:27 PESSIMISM ABOUT US-CHINA RELATIONS SEEMS TO BE PERMEATING THE AIR RECENTLY. MANY OBSERVERS ON BOTH SIDES HAVE RUNG ALARM BELLS ABOUT GROWING TENSION IN THE RELATIONSHIP, ESPECIALLY OVER CYBERSECURITY, THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND STOCK MARKET TURMOIL. WHAT HAS GONE WRONG? HOW CAN THE TWO COUNTRIES MOVE THIS VITAL RELATIONSHIP FORWARD? IN 1940, KENNETH WHERRY, MAYOR OF PAWNEE CITY, NEBRASKA, SAID, "WITH GOD'S HELP, WE WILL LIFT SHANGHAI UP AND UP, EVER UP, UNTIL IT IS JUST LIKE KANSAS CITY." IF WHERRY, WHO BECAME A US SENATOR LATER, WERE STILL ALIVE TODAY, HE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT MODERN SHANGHAI REMAINS DIFFERENT FROM KANSAS CITY, BUT IT IS PROBABLY KANSAS CITY THAT NEEDS TO BE LIFTED UP IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT NOW. AMERICANS HAVE A MISSIONARY IMPULSE TO CHANGE CHINA, EITHER BY CHRISTIANIZING IT IN THE 19TH CENTURY OR DEMOCRATIZING IT IN THE 21ST CENTURY. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF INTERACTIONS, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN DEALING WITH CHINA FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH; IT IS ILL-PREPARED TO LIVE WITH A NATION AS BIG AND ALMOST AS POWERFUL AS ITSELF. CHINA'S METEORIC RE-EMERGENCE AS A GLOBAL POWER BY THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY IS TRULY STUNNING TO AMERICANS AND EVEN TO MANY CHINESE. THE US ECONOMY SUFFERED SERIOUSLY IN THE 2008-2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS, FROM WHICH IT IS STILL RECOVERING. MEANWHILE, THE CHINESE ECONOMY HAS CONTINUED TO CHARGE FORWARD, AND AFTER OVERTAKING JAPAN AS THE WORLD'S SECOND-LARGEST ECONOMY IN 2010, IT IS POISED TO TAKE THE TOP SPOT SOON. THE GLOBAL POWER STRUCTURE HAS CHANGED FUNDAMENTALLY. THE AMERICAN CONCERN ABOUT CHINA'S RISING POWER REFLECTS AMERICANS' LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THEIR COMPETITION WITH CHINA. THE REALITY IS THAT CHINA REMAINS A DEVELOPING COUNTRY DESPITE A LARGE ECONOMY. ACCORDING TO PREMIER LI KEQIANG, 200 MILLION CHINESE STILL LIVE IN POVERTY. CHINA FACES TREMENDOUS DOMESTIC CHALLENGES, INCLUDING A WIDENING INCOME GAP, AN AGING POPULATION, RAMPANT CORRUPTION AND A DETERIORATING ENVIRONMENT. THE UNITED STATES REMAINS FAR AHEAD OF CHINA, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION. THE TWO ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES ARE COMPLEMENTARY IN MANY ASPECTS. A RECENT STUDY BY THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON US-CHINA RELATIONS AND THE RHODIUM GROUP REVEALS THAT FROM 2000 TO 2014, CHINESE FIRMS SPENT NEARLY $46 BILLION ON NEW ESTABLISHMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS IN THE US. CHINESE-AFFILIATED COMPANIES DIRECTLY EMPLOY MORE THAN 80,000 AMERICANS. IF THE US CONTINUES TO WELCOME CHINA'S BOOMING INVESTMENT, IT COULD RECEIVE BETWEEN $100 BILLION TO $200 BILLION FROM CHINA BY 2020, WHICH WOULD ADD BETWEEN 200,000 AND 400,000 FULL-TIME JOBS IN THE US. CHINA IS THE LARGEST TRADING PARTNER OF A GROWING NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, FROM ASIA TO AFRICA AND FROM LATIN AMERICA TO THE MIDDLE EAST. A TRADE REGIME WITHOUT CHINA'S PARTICIPATION IS UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED. CHINA-LED NEW INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE ASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT BANK (AIIB) COMPLEMENT THE WORK OF THE WORLD BANK AND ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK. "PIVOT" AND "NEW TYPE OF GREAT POWER RELATIONS" ARE ATTEMPTS BY THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, RESPECTIVELY, TO HANDLE THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP, BUT THEY ARE POORLY DEFINED AND LARGELY MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE OTHER SIDE. AMERICANS GENERALLY BELIEVE THAT CHINA HAS BECOME MORE ASSERTIVE IN FOREIGN POLICY AND INTENDS TO REPLACE THE US IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS. MANY CHINESE GENUINELY THINK THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING TO BLOCK CHINA'S RISE. LACK OF TRUST HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE OUTSTANDING PROBLEM BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. BUT HOW TO BUILD TRUST? GOING FORWARD, THE TWO COUNTRIES MUST FIRST READJUST THEIR MENTALITY. FOR CHINA, THE PRIORITY REMAINS AT HOME. CHINESE LEADERS MUST RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO FLEX MUSCLES ABROAD. IT IS NOT TIME TO ABANDON DENG XIAOPING'S DICTUM OF LYING LOW AND FOCUSING ON GROWTH. THE UNITED STATES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MUST BE REALISTIC AND REMOVE IDEOLOGICAL LENSES TO OVERCOME THE "CHINA FEAR". IT MUST ALSO REIN IN ITS SMALLER ALLIES IN ASIA SO AS TO AVOID CONFLICTS THAT WILL DRAG THE US AND CHINA INTO DIRECT CONFRONTATION. CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE JOINED AT THE HIP. THERE IS NO BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THEM. THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO ALLOW HARDLINERS OR PROTECTIONISTS TO INTERFERE WITH THE GENERALLY COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP. DISAGREEMENT ON CERTAIN ISSUES AND OCCASIONAL QUARRELS ARE PART OF THE NORMAL LIFE IN A RELATIONSHIP. MUTUAL ACCOMMODATION AND APPRECIATION WILL ENHANCE PERSONAL RELATIONS AS WELL AS RELATIONS BETWEEN NATIONS. ZHIQUN ZHU IS A PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AT BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY IN LEWISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA. (CHINA DAILY USA 09/23/2015 PAGE12)

5	CATERHAM PHOTOGRAPHER 'CHASING THE PERFECT PICTURE' TALKS ABOUT HER CAREER CAPTURING ARTISTS ON TOUR 16:48, 22 SEP 2015 UPDATED 16:49, 22 SEP 2015 BY AMANIHUGHES, CHRISTIE GOODWIN HAS BEEN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS SINCE THE AGE OF 12 AND HAS BUILT UP AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY CAPTURING TOP RECORDING ARTISTS ON TOUR VIEW GALLERY FROM THE LIKES OF KATY PERRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND ONE DIRECTION, THIS PHOTOGRAPHER FROM CATERHAM HAS CAPTURED A HEAP OF FAMOUS NAMES AND IS CONTINUING HER SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT PICTURE. CHRISTIE GOODWIN, A BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHER, WHOSE CAREER SPANS MORE THAN 35 YEARS, STARTED TAKING PICTURES AT THE AGE OF 12 AND WAS BOUGHT HER FIRST CAMERA AT 13. SHE GRADUATED FROM THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS IN ANTWERP AND GOT HER FIRST JOB IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY, EVOLVING TOWARDS EDITORIAL AND WORKING FOR NEWS AGENCIES BEFORE ENDING UP IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND TAKING PICTURES OF ARTISTS ON TOUR. CHRISTIE'S PORTFOLIO IS A WHO'S WHO OF TOP NAMES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, INCLUDING KATY PERRY, ED SHEERAN, USHER, TAYLOR SWIFT, ONE DIRECTION, SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY AND KYLIE MINOGUE, AMONG MANY OTHERS. SHE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME ON TOUR CAPTURING IMAGES OF ARTISTS WHICH APPEAR ON CDS, DVDS, TOUR MERCHANDISE, POSTERS, INTERNATIONAL PUBLICATIONS, BOOKS AND EXHIBITIONS. EVEN THOUGH CHRISTIE HAS BEEN ON TOUR WITH MANY ARTISTS SHE ADMITTED SHE IS STILL ON THE HUNT FOR THE ELUSIVE PERFECT PICTURE. THE THING I HAVE BEEN CHASING IS THE PERFECT PICTURE, IT KEEPS ME GOING, TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT, CHRISTIE SAID. PHOTOGRAPHY IS BASICALLY ONE MOMENT IN TIME AND YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL TO OTHERS, THAT'S WHY YOU CAPTURE IT, TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE WHAT YOU FELT AND WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED. I WANT TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT IN TIME, IF I SHOOT A SHOW I WANT THE VIEWER TO FEEL LIKE THEY WERE THERE, THAT WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT A PICTURE THEY FEEL THE MUSIC AND FEEL THE CROWD. THAT'S WHAT I AIM FOR IN MY PHOTOGRAPHY. @CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE EXPLAINED OUT OF ALL THE TOURS SHE HAS CAPTURED, KATY PERRY'S PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR WAS THE MOST EXCITING. I STARTED DOING THE REHEARSALS SO I ACTUALLY SAW THE SHOW BUILD UP TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE END, I SPEND TWO TO THREE WEEKS ON THE SHOW. IT WAS REALLY EXCITING TO SEE HOW SOMETHING COMES TO LIFE. THROUGHOUT HER ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER CHRISTIE HAS CAPTURED SOME POWERFUL IMAGES, FROM BB KING AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL TO SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY STRUMMING A GUITAR. HOWEVER SHE EXPLAINED HER FAVOURITE MOMENT TAKEN SO FAR WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF KATY PERRY DURING HER PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR. AN IMAGE WHICH IS NOW ICONIC AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD TO PUBLICISE THE TOUR. IN THE SHOW IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE FIREWORKS WERE BEHIND HER, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN, CHRISTIE SAID. THE MOMENT THE FIREWORKS GO, YOU GET TO SHOOT THREE FRAMES, SHE DIDN'T HAVE HER HEAD AROUND, THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE FIREWORKS. THAT FRAME HAS MADE HISTORY AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD, IT WAS A LUCKY SHOT AND I WAS HAPPY THAT WE GOT IT. ALWAYS ON THE MOVE EVEN THOUGH PHOTOGRAPHING FAMOUS ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS SOUNDS EXCITING AND CONSTANTLY DIFFERENT, CHRISTIE ASSURED IT WAS NOT ALWAYS GLAMOROUS, AS YOU ARE ALWAYS ON THE MOVE AND NEVER IN ONE PLACE FOR VERY LONG. WHEN YOU DO NOT TRAVEL, IT'S VERY EXCITING BUT WHEN YOU TRAVEL ALL THE TIME, LITTLE THINGS START TO BOTHER YOU, YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR LAUNDRY AND YOU ARE NOT IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG TIME, IT'S A DRAG. HOWEVER IN CONTRAST TO THIS CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE EASILY GETS BORED AND ITCHY FEET WHEN SHE COMES HOME TO CATERHAM AND IS EAGER TO GET OFF TO HER NEXT DESTINATION AND NEXT TOUR. THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS I DO ENJOY, YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES, SLEEP IN YOUR OWN BED, BUT AFTER THREE DAYS I WANT TO GO AGAIN, I GET BORED. WHEN I AM ON THE ROAD, I WANT TO BE BACK AT HOME AND WHEN I'M HOME I WANT TO BE ON THE ROAD. I CANNOT LIVE AT HOME, I WOULD GET BORED, BUT YOU ALSO CANNOT BE ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME, I NEED A COMBINATION OF THE TWO. WHEN ASKED IF SHE COULD IMAGINE HER LIFE TAKING A DIFFERENT PATH, CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED DOING ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN PHOTOGRAPHY. I COULD NOT BE ANYTHING ELSE, WHEN I PICK UP A CAMERA, IT'S JUST ME AND THE CAMERA, IT'S PART OF ME, IT'S WHO I AM, I CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT THE CAMERA. TAKE PHOTOS LIKE A PRO CHRISTIE HAS TEAMED UP WITH CURRYS PC WORLD TO HELP MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR CAMERA EQUIPMENT AND PROVIDES HER TOP TIPS ON HOW TO CAPTURE PHOTOGRAPHS AT FESTIVALS, FROM TAKING THE PERFECT FESTIVAL SELFIE, LOOKING TO NAVIGATE OBSTRUCTIVE CROWDS OR CAPTURING FAST-MOVING STAGE ACTION. PLAN AHEAD: LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE, KNOW WHICH ARTISTS YOU WANT TO SHOOT, AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT IF YOU WISH TO PHOTOGRAPH BANDS ON DIFFERENT STAGES, YOU NEED TO GET THERE IN TIME. ALSO PREPARE FOR THE FACT THAT THEY MIGHT NOT START EXACTLY WHEN THEYRE SUPPOSED TO. I ALWAYS CARRY MY OWN FESTIVAL SCHEDULE ON MY PHONE. SHOOTING MY FIRST BIG FESTIVAL EARLY ON IN MY CAREER, I NEARLY MISSED AC/DC, BECAUSE I WASNT PREPARED! BE PREPARED: MAKE SURE YOU BRING ENOUGH MEMORY CARDS AND BATTERY POWER TO LAST ALL THE WAY. CHANCES ARE YOU WONT HAVE ANYWHERE TO CHARGE THEM FOR HOURS AND YOU DONT WANT TO RUN OUT JUST BEFORE YOUR FAVOURITE BAND IS ON. KEEP THEM IN A LITTLE POUCH WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES AND MAKE SURE ITS WATERPROOF, SO YOU DONT BECOME VICTIM TO FAILING CAMERA EQUIPMENT. COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS: FESTIVAL STAGES CAN BE QUITE MESSY AND CLUTTERY, SO TAKE THE TIME TO COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS. LOOK FOR ANGLES WHERE YOU CAN AVOID PEOPLE OR OBJECTS THAT WILL MAKE THE PHOTO LOOK A MESS. FESTIVAL STAGES CAN ALSO BE VERY HIGH, ESPECIALLY THE MAIN STAGE, SO IT CAN EVEN BE A CHALLENGE FOR US PROS IN THE PHOTO PIT IN FRONT OF THE STAGE. BUT MAKE SURE YOU WAIT FOR THOSE MOMENTS WHEN YOUR FAVOURITE SINGER IS RIGHT AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE THATS WHERE YOU GET YOUR BEST SHOTS. REMEMBER THE CROWD: SOME OF MY BEST SHOTS ARE NOT OF THE ARTISTS BUT OF PEOPLE IN THE CROWD. THE CROWD OFTEN MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE AND CAN BRING TO LIFE THAT FEELING YOU GET BEING AT A FESTIVAL. THE GO PRO HERO 4 OR EE 4GEE ACTION CAM ARE GREAT FOR THIS KIND OF SHOT DUE TO THEIR ULTRA-WIDE ANGLE LENSES FOR A UNIQUE CROWD VIEW. WHEN YOU DO THIS, TRY TO HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER OR EVEN LOWER, PLAY WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES. MAKE SURE TO ALSO TAKE AT LEAST ONE LONG WALK AROUND THE WHOLE FESTIVAL GROUND TO HELP YOU FIND THE PERFECT SUBJECTS. MIND THE RAIN: FESTIVALS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR EVER-CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS. PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEOPLE IN THE MUD ARE TOKEN FESTIVAL SHOTS. HAVING RAIN VISIBLE IN THE SHOT CAN ADD SOMETHING INTERESTING, SO DONT TAKE IT AS A BAD THING. I NEVER GO TO A FESTIVAL WITHOUT A PLASTIC BAG TO PROTECT MY GEAR, AND HAVING A WATERPROOF CASE OR AN ACTUAL WATERPROOF CAMERA LIKE THE FUJIFILM XP80 CAN HELP TO CATER FOR ANY WEATHER CHANGE. CONSIDER YOUR LENSES: CHANGING LENSES IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD CAN BE A NIGHTMARE. DUST, MUD, THE BOOTS OF A CROWDSURFER AND AN AIRBOURNE CUP OF BEER HAVE A WAY OF FINDING YOU THE TIME YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LENS. PRACTICE CHANGING THE LENS UNDER A PLASTIC BAG OR UNDER YOUR JACKET. BECOME A FESTIVAL SELFIE KING OR QUEEN: IF YOURE GOING TO TAKE A SELFIE, MAKE SURE THE SELFIE TELLS A STORY. YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE OF YOURSELF, OR YOU CAN TAKE A FEW EXTRA SECONDS AND FRAME THAT SELFIE A LITTLE BETTER, GET SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THE SHOT, OR SOMETHING ANNOYING OUT OF IT. TAKE YOUR TIME, LOOK AROUND, AND MAYBE HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER SO THAT YOU HAVE THE WHOLE FESTIVAL IN THE BACKGROUND. IF YOU TAKE A LOT OF SELFIES, THE COMPACT PANASONIC TZ57 HAS A SELFIE SCREEN AND WI-FI SO YOU CAN POST IT ON THE WEB IMMEDIATELY. THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT: WHEN YOU TAKE PHOTOS OF YOUR FRIENDS, OR WHEN YOU TAKE SELFIES, TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT. IF THE SUN IS BEHIND THE PERSON IN THE PHOTO, THEIR FACE WILL BE DARKER. ITS NOT A BAD IDEA TO USE A FLASH IF YOURE SHOOTING AGAINST THE LIGHT, EVEN ON A SUNNY DAY. OR DO THE OPPOSITE, SHOOT AGAINST THE LIGHT AND PLAY WITH DARK SILHOUETTES. YOU DONT NEED A PRO CAMERA TO GET AN AMAZING SHOT LIKE THAT. TAKE IN THE VIEW: IT CAN BE REALLY FUN TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT LENSES. A FISH-EYE OR WIDE-ANGLE LENS CAN REALLY HELP CAPTURE THE SCALE OF THE FESTIVAL. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE FUN. A FISH-EYE IS A PRIME LENS, MEANING THAT YOU CANT ZOOM IN OR OUT WITH IT. THEREFORE, ITS UP TO YOU TO ACT AS THE ZOOM FOR THE LENS. BE SURE TO CHANGE PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES AND LINES. GET DOWN LOW TO THE GROUND, EVEN IF IT MEANS LAYING ON YOUR STOMACH IN WHATS LEFT OF THE FESTIVAL GRASS. LEAN UP AGAINST A WALL AND USE THE DISTORTION OF THE LENS TO WRAP THE WALL AROUND THE FRAME. JUST HAVE FUN! BE AWARE THAT IF YOU FRAME A CLOSE UP OF A PERSON NEAR THE OUTER EDGES OF A WIDE ANGLE OR FISH-EYE SHOT, THEIR FACE CAN BE STRETCHED OUT. KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT: THIS ONE IS CRUCIAL. GETTING A NEW CAMERA WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT FEATURES IS TEMPTING, BUT MAKE SURE YOU LEARN HOW TO USE THEM. WALK THROUGH THE MANUAL GUIDE AND TEST IT ALL OUT. IT MIGHT SEEM A BIT TEDIOUS TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE STEPS BUT EVEN THE PRO PHOTOGRAPHER TAKES HIS TIME TO LEARN TO KNOW THEIR CAMERA. ONCE YOU KNOW ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF YOUR CAMERA AND HOW TO USE THEM THEN THERE IS NOTHING STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND THAT PERFECT SHOT. CHRISTIE ADDED TO TAKE MANY PHOTOS, AS IT IS THE VOLUME THAT MATTERS AND GET TO KNOW YOUR CAMERA. DO NOT SHOOT ON THE AUTOMATIC, PUT YOUR CAMERA ON MANUAL AND TEST IT OUT, YOU CANNOT LET THE CAMERA THINK FOR YOU, YOU HAVE TO THINK FOR THE CAMERA AND SHOOT WHAT YOU WANT.

BUFFINGTON TOLD THE COUNCIL THAT WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT, IT PUTS THE COMMUNITY IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION REGARDING ZONING. YOU DONT HAVE THE TOOLS IN PLACE (WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT) TO HAVE ZONING, PERIOD, BUFFINGTON TOLD THE COUNCIL AT ITS PREVIOUS MEETING. YOU DONT HAVE A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT SO THERE IS NO DUE PROCESS. IF YOU HAVE CHALLENGES (TO ZONING ORDINANCES), IT COULD BE A MESS BECAUSE YOU LOST YOUR ABILITY TO ZONE WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. IN ORDER TO HAVE ZONING, YOU MUST HAVE A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. THE CITY, BUFFINGTON SAID, COULD HAVE THE SAME CITIZENS ON BOTH THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT AND PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION. A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT IS COMPRISED OF FIVE MEMBERS AND HANDLES ZONING AND VARIANCE MATTERS. WALTER, WHO SERVED AS CITY CLERK FOR THREE DECADES SAID THE COMMUNITY HASNT HAD A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT FOR AT LEAST A DECADE. SHE SAID THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE LACK OF A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT WAS FINDING PEOPLE WILLING TO SERVE ON THE BOARD. IN THE ONLY OTHER AGENDA MATTER, THE COUNCIL SET A 4 P.M. HEARING MONDAY, OCT. 12, FOR THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT TO CONSIDER A VARIANCE FOR THE WINFIELD HEALTH CARE AND RETIREMENT CENTER. THE COUNCILS NEXT MEETING WILL ALSO BE ON MONDAY, OCT. 12, AT 7 P.M. IN CITY HALL.

8	BLOG FALL CHALLENGE REVIEW LETS START BY THROWING OUT A HUGE THANK YOU TO DAVE, CHRIS AND JESSE THE OWNERS OF THE WEST COAST TRIPLE CROWN FOR HOSTING ANOTHER FANTASTIC EVENT. AS ALWAYS IT WAS RIGHT ON SCHEDULE WITH NO LONG BREAKS AND THE PROGRAMMING WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND BATTLE TESTED. MY GUESS IS EVERY WORKOUT WENT EXACTLY HOW THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL THE VOLUNTEERS WHO GAVE UP THEIR TIME TO JUDGE AND HELP SETUP FOR THIS EVENT. I PERSONALLY DONT DO ENOUGH VOLUNTEERING AT LOCAL EVENTS AND I PLAN ON CHANGING THAT IN THE FUTURE AND I HOPE SOME OF YOU WILL AS WELL. EVENT LIKE THESE CANT GO OFF WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE COMMUNITY. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THEY DONT MAKE ENOUGH DOING THESE TO PAY EVERYONE. IT WAS SO AWESOME THAT SO MANY OF YOU LIONS FAITHFUL CAME UP TO SQUAMISH ON A HORRIBLE RAINY WEEKEND TO SUPPORT OUR ATHLETES. VANESSA (AKA MIKE TYSON), KARINA, ANNIE, SCOTT, KATHRYN,JEFF, PAULINE, MRS HARRISON, MY MOM, JOHN ON SATURDAY, CHRISTI ON SATURDAY, OWEN ON SUNDAY. IT REALLY MEANT A TON TO EVERYONE TO HAVE YOU GUYS CHEERING. PERSONALLY I HEARD EVERY CHEER WHILE ON THE FLOOR. SATURDAY THE INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION RECAP: TEAM LIONS FOR SATURDAY WAS GILL FOR THE LADIES AND THEN MYSELF, BRETT, OWEN, SHAYAN AND MIKE. GILL: FINISHED ON THE PODIUM FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WITH A 3RD PLACE OVERALL FINISH. HER WEEKEND WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A DOMINATING FIRST PLACE PERFORMANCE IN THE 5K RUN AND A 4TH PLACE FINISH IN THE CROSSFITTY CROSSFIT WOD.

ALL THE INDIVIDUAL ATHLETES DID THE GYM PROUD AND I THINK WE ALL LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE OUR FITNESS IS AT AND WHAT WE NEED TO WORK ON. TEAM COMPETITION ON SUNDAY: TEAMS WERE MADE UP OF 1 MALE AND 1 FEMALE. THE WORKOUTS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THE INDIVIDUAL EVENT HELD ON SATURDAY AND 4 OF US DID BOTH DAYS. HICKS AND HARRISON: GILL AND I FINISHED 4TH OUT OF THE 40 TEAMS COMPETING. IT INCLUDED A FIRST PLACE ON THE RUN EVENT AND A 3RD PLACE ON THE MUSCLE UPS. IT ALSO MUST BE SAID THAT IF I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO PUT TWO FEET ON THE FINISH MAT AFTER MY LAST KEG CARRY WE WOULD HAVE FINISHED THE WEEKEND IN 3RD PLACE. WOOPS. JAME AND ODLUND: COACH JOHN AND HIS LOVELY GIRLFRIEND CAMILA PARTNERED UP AND DID AWESOME WITH AN 11TH PLACE FINISH OVERALL.

A COUPLE HICKUPS ALL AROUND (INCLUDING SOME OUT OF OUR CONTROL) BUT OVERALL A VERY ENJOYABLE TIME NO DOUBT. THE CASCADE CLASSIC, THE LARGEST EVENT IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, IS NEXT UP FOR CROSSFIT LIONS. ITS ON THANKSGIVING WEEKEND AND SCOTT AND ANNIE HAVE BOTH QUALIFIED TO COMPETE. THERE WILL BE A CREW OF US HEADING DOWN FOR THE WEEKEND AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US LET ME KNOW. TONS OF TOP CROSSFIT GAMES ATHLETES WILL BE THROWING DOWN.

10	INNOV8TIV INNOV8TIV - BLACKS IN TECHNOLOGY IN USA, UK, CARIBBEAN ISLANDS & AFRICA NIGERIA HAS A COLLECTIVE BANDWIDTH CAPACITY OF MORE THAN 19 TERABYTES, WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, THE SUBMARINE CABLES BROUGHT IN BY THE MAINONE, WACS, AND GLO 1 AMONG OTHER INTERNET PLAYERS. ALL THESE BROADBAND INVESTMENTS WERE MADE IN ANTICIPATION THAT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT WILL ENCOURAGE THE PENETRATION OF BROADBAND USAGE TO ABOUT 30% BY THE YEAR 2017. HOWEVER, THE PENETRATION RATE HAS BEEN QUITE LOW, AND STAKEHOLDERS ARE ALREADY CONCERNED. THE CURRENT BROADBAND PENETRATION IN NIGERIA STANDS AT 10%, DESPITE THE COUNTRYS GREAT CAPABILITY. OVER THE LAST WEEKEND, TWO FORUMS WERE HELD WHERE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF GOVERNMENT PUSH TO FAST-TRACK THE ADOPTION OF BROADBAND ACROSS NIGERIA WERE DISCUSSED. THE TWO FORUMS WERE THE NIGERIA INTERNET GROUP (NIG) UNDER THE THEME: INTERNET PENETRATION: THE WAY FORWARD AND THE NIGERIA INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY REPORTERS ASSOCIATION (NITRA) WHICH HELD ITS QUARTERLY SEMINAR UNDER THE THEME: FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AN IMPETUS TO ACHIEVING UBIQUITOUS BROADBAND PENETRATION . ALL THESE FORUMS CENTERED ON THE DISCUSSIONS LOOKING AT VARIOUS WAYS TO REMOVE OBSTACLES PREVENTING HIGHER RATE OF BROADBAND PENETRATION. THE STAKEHOLDERS DESCRIBED THE RATE AS SNAIL SPEED DEVELOPMENT FROWNING AT THE AWKWARD RATE OF PENETRATION REGISTERED IN THE FEW PAST MONTHS. THEY SAY THAT THE MULTIPLE TAXATIONS, DEGRADATION OF THE NAIRA AND THE STATES GOVERNMENT MOVE TO INSTALL FIBER OPTIC CABLES THROUGH THE FEDERATION TO BE CAUSING THE SNAIL-PACED BROADBAND PENETRATION RATE. THEY URGED THE STATE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO LINK UP THE FIBRE OPTIC. ACCORDING TO THEM, THIS MOVE WILL HELP THEM GENERATE MORE REVENUE, AND THE ECONOMYS GDP WILL INCREASE. EMMANUEL EKWUEM, THE CEO AT TELEDOM GROUP AND THE CHAIRMAN AT THE OCCASION SAID: OUR CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION SHOULD BE PUT TO WORK IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE CONTENT ALSO NEEDS TO BE SCRUTINIZED. ACCORDING TO EKWUEM, NIGERIA NEEDS TO CHECK ON THE TYPE OF CONTENT THAT WILL BE PRODUCED AND THE IMPACT THEY WILL HAVE ON THE DAILY LIVES OF THE USERS. GBENGA ADEBAYO THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF LICENSED TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATORS OF NIGERIA (ALTON) THROUGH REPRESENTATION SHARED HIS SKEPTICISM ON BROADBAND PENETRATION GOING FAR GIVEN THE CURRENT CHALLENGES BEDEVILING THE SECTOR. WITHOUT THE REMOVAL OF MULTIPLE TAXATION AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE POWER SECTOR, NIGERIA CANNOT ACHIEVE 30% BROADBAND PENETRATION LAMENTED ADEBAYO. TO READ MORE ON THIS, FOLLOW THIS LINK .

11	SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- (MARKETWIRED) -- 09/08/15 -- " EARLOBE REPAIR IS A POPULAR PROCEDURE AMONG BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AT MY PRACTICE," STATES SAN FRANCISCO PLASTIC SURGEON KAREN HORTON, MD . "WOMEN USUALLY WISH TO ADDRESS STRETCHED OUT EAR PIERCINGS OR TORN EARLOBES, AND MEN OFTEN WANT TO CORRECT SIZEABLE HOLES RESULTING FROM LARGE DISCS -- KNOWN AS GAUGES -- INSERTED IN THEIR EARLOBES THAT WERE ONCE DESIRED BUT NO LONGER FIT WITH THEIR CURRENT LOOK. IN ADDITION TO THESE CONCERNS, MANY MEN AND WOMEN ALSO SEE ME FOR KELOID SCARS IN THE EARS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED FROM PAST PIERCINGS, INFECTIONS, OR TRAUMA." FOR INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN EARLOBE REPAIR, DR. HORTON SAYS SHE FIRST OBTAINS A COMPLETE MEDICAL HISTORY AND CONDUCTS A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE TARGETED AREA DURING AN INITIAL CONSULTATION. SHOULD SHE DETERMINE THAT EARLOBE CORRECTION SURGERY WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OPTION FOR THE PATIENT'S UNIQUE NEEDS -- AS OPPOSED TO NONSURGICAL EARLOBE REJUVENATION VIA FILLERS -- THE PROCEDURE IS DISCUSSED IN EXTENSIVE DETAIL, AND A SURGICAL DATE IS SCHEDULED IF THE PATIENT WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED. ON THE DAY OF SURGERY, THE SAN FRANCISCO PLASTIC SURGEON NOTES THAT THE TREATMENT AREA IS MARKED, AND THE PATIENT VISUALLY CONFIRMS WHAT IS TO BE PERFORMED. NEXT, LOCAL ANESTHESIA IS ADMINISTERED, AND THE PROCEDURE IS CONDUCTED UNDER MAGNIFICATION TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF ACCURACY AND PRECISION. "DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION," DR. HORTON WRITES IN A RECENT BLOG POST OVERVIEWING EARLOBE REPAIR , "EXCESS SCARRING, SKIN, OR TISSUE IS REMOVED, AND THE REMAINING EARLOBE TISSUE IS 'LOCALLY REARRANGED' TO CREATE A MORE NORMAL APPEARING EARLOBE." IF A PIERCING IS STILL DESIRED AFTER THE OPERATION, THE EARLOBE CAN ALSO BE RE-PIERCED AT THE TIME OF SURGERY. IN REGARD TO RECOVERY FROM EARLOBE REPAIR , DR. HORTON EXPLAINS THAT SOME TEMPORARY SWELLING AND/OR BRUISING CAN BE EXPECTED INITIALLY, BUT THESE SIDE EFFECTS SHOULD DIMINISH RELATIVELY QUICKLY. "DOWNTIME IS TYPICALLY MINIMAL, WITH MOST INDIVIDUALS RETURNING TO WORK AND/OR NORMAL DAILY ROUTINES THE DAY AFTER THEIR PROCEDURE. THAT SAID, PATIENTS ARE ADVISED TO AVOID STRENUOUS ACTIVITIES AND RIGOROUS EXERCISE FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE TO TWO WEEKS IN ORDER TO HELP ENSURE PROPER HEALING." ULTIMATELY, WHEN PERFORMED BY AN EXPERIENCED BOARD CERTIFIED PLASTIC SURGEON, DR. HORTON STATES THAT EARLOBE REPAIR CAN BE AN EXCEPTIONALLY GRATIFYING PROCEDURE FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS, ENABLING THEM TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR EARLOBES. ABOUT KAREN HORTON, MD CERTIFIED BY THE AMERICAN BOARD OF PLASTIC SURGERY, DR. HORTON OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF COSMETIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE PROCEDURES FOR THE BREASTS, FACE, AND BODY, AS WELL AS SEVERAL NONSURGICAL SKIN CARE AND MED-SPA TREATMENTS. SHE IS A FELLOW OF BOTH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS AND THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS OF CANADA, AND SHE REMAINS ACTIVE IN THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS, THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS, AND VARIOUS OTHER PRESTIGIOUS MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS. ABOVE ALL, DR. HORTON IS DEVOTED TO ENSURING EVERY PATIENT RECEIVES THE SAFEST, MOST EFFECTIVE CARE POSSIBLE FOR THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS AND DESIRES.

12	YOU MAY NOTICE A FEW THINGS LOOK DIFFERENT AROUND HERE . THATS BECAUSE WE HAVE REVAMPED ISSUUS COLOR PALETTE, AS PART OF A CONTINUING EFFORT TO UNIFY OUR BRAND PRESENTATION AND EXPERIENCE ACROSS PLATFORMS. WE CALL THIS OUR LIGHT THEME. IF YOU USE OUR AWARD-WINNING IOS APP (AND IF YOU HAVENT YET, YOURE IN FOR A TREAT), ISSUUS NEW COLOR PALETTE IS AN INVERSION OF THE DARK THEME FOUND IN THAT APP. THE SHIFT IN OUR DESIGN THINKING BEGAN LAST FALL WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE IOS APP, AND I WANTED TO SHARE WHAT WE LEARNED FROM A BRAND AND UX PERSPECTIVE. THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO ROLL OUT BRAND SHIFTS AND EXPERIENCE UPDATES. ONE APPROACH IS THE BIG BANG, WHERE ALL THE GUIDELINES GET RESPECIFIED; NEW ASSETS ARE CREATED; AND PRODUCTS ARE BUILT, TESTED AND LAUNCHED ON ALL THE PLATFORMS AT ONCE. BANG! THIS PROCESS CAN WORK FOR NEW COMPANIES THAT ARE ABLE TO DESIGN FROM SCRATCH, OR FOR LARGE ENTERPRISES THAT CAN DEDICATE TEAMS OVER THE COURSE OF MONTHS, AND SOMETIMES YEARS TO THE ENDEAVOR. THE SECOND WAY IS INCREMENTAL. THIS IS BEST FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE GROWING FAST AND FOCUSING RESOURCES ACROSS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PROJECTS. AT ISSUU, OUR PRIORITY IS ON BRINGING AS MANY FEATURES TO PUBLISHERS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO HELP THEM GROW THEIR BUSINESS AND EXPAND THEIR AUDIENCE. STARTING FRESH ON IOS, WE HAD THE FREEDOM TO EXPERIMENT, SINCE THERE WASNT ANY RISK OF IMPINGING ON EXISTING USERS. WE WENT AHEAD AND REGARDED THE NATIVE APP AS A GUIDEPOST, A NORTH STAR INDICATING WHERE WE WANTED TO GO WITH THE BRAND AND EXPERIENCE. WE RECEIVED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK ON THE IOS APPS FUNCTIONALITY AND LOOK AND FEEL, AND WERE USING THIS TO INFORM OUR EVOLVING WEB AND ANDROID PLATFORMS. KEEPING IT LIGHT IN DEVELOPING THE IOS APP, WE SPECIFIED A FAMILY OF COLORS, BUTTON STYLES, TYPOGRAPHY AND PERSONAS TO BE APPLIED ACROSS ISSUU. THERE WAS SOME TECHNICAL WORK TO DO BEFORE WE COULD PUSH THESE CHANGES TO THE ENTIRE WEBSITE. WE REDESIGNED AND RELAUNCHED THE ISSUU HELP CENTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AS AN INCREMENTAL TEST TO SEE HOW IT WOULD AFFECT PERFORMANCE. ALTHOUGH THAT UPDATE DID INDEED CHANGE FUNCTIONALITY, BASED ON OUR CUSTOMER RESPONSES AND USER DATA WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT WE MADE THE RIGHT MOVES. THE TAN HUES IN THE NEW LIGHT THEME OF ISSUU.COM ARE MEANT TO WARM UP THE EXPERIENCE MAKING THE SITE A MORE INVITING AND FRIENDLY PLACE COMPARED WITH THE COLD WHITE, BLUE AND GREEN TONES FOUND BEFORE. SOME OF THE CHANGES ARE MORE SUBTLE: THE NEUTRAL GRAY USED IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE READER IS MEANT TO SHOWCASE OUR PUBLISHERS CONTENT MORE ACCURATELY THAN THE HEAVY BLUE BACKGROUND USED EARLIER, WHICH APPLIED SOMETHING OF A BLUE CAST TO THE CONTENT. TO BE CLEAR, WE HAVE NOT ALTERED FUNCTIONALITY; THIS IS SIMPLY A COLOR SHIFT. ALL THE MENU ITEMS, STACKS AND CONTROLS ARE EXACTLY IN THE SAME PLACE AND WORK THE SAME WAY. WHAT WE SEEK IS A CLEARER HIERARCHY OF EXISTING ELEMENTS, SUCH AS THE SEARCH BOX STANDING OUT IN WHITE, SCREAMING TYPE IN ME! FROM THIS POINT WE ARE MONITORING REACTIONS AND RESPONSES, ISOLATING AND ADDRESSING ANY PROBLEMS THAT ARISE. TYPE THE NEXT CHAPTER ONE ELEMENT THAT IS QUITE CHALLENGING TO CHANGE AT OUR SCALE IS TYPOGRAPHY. AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR MOBILE OFFERINGS, WE NEED TO EMPLOY A TYPE SPEC THAT ADJUSTS TO THE VARIOUS SIZES OF SCREENS FAVORED BY OUR USERS. WE HAVE ADAPTED OUR CURRENT TYPE SPEC OF 4 TO A FAMILY OF TYPE SPECS OF 28. THERE ISNT A DEFINITIVE DATE ON THIS RELEASE, BUT I PLEDGE TO KEEP YOU POSTED. BRAND GUIDELINES WILL BE CHANGING AS WELL WITH OUR NEW BRAND PAGES SHOWING UP SOON, ALONG WITH CLEARER MESSAGES ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT MAKE ISSUU GREAT. WERE ALWAYS DRIVING ADVANCES IN THE ISSUU EXPERIENCE. YET WE MAKE THESE MOVES AS THOUGHTFULLY AS POSSIBLE, AND HOPE YOU FIND THEM TO YOUR LIKING. OUR MISSION IS TO ENABLE PUBLISHERS TO THRIVE AND TO CONNECT READERS WITH THE CONTENT THEY LOVE. HAVE COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS? TWEET AT US @ISSUU . WERE EAGER TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK. JEREMY LACROIX IS ISSUUS VP OF DESIGN UX AND BRAND. FOLLOW HIM AT @J_LACROIX ON TWITTER.
13	FINALLY, THE CONFESSION WE HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. DIFFICULT THOUGH IT IS TO IGNORE THE STRETCHING OF CREDIBILITY IN THESE EPISODES, ILL DO MY BEST. ROBERT URGES TRACY TO TELL THE TRUTH - TO CONFESS TO CARLA THAT IT WAS HER WHO STARTED THE FIRE. ITS NOT EASY WATCHING HER TORTURE HERSELF OVER SOMETHING YOU DID. THIS OF COURSE BEGS THE QUESTION, WHY IS HE SO BOTHERED? IS IT BECAUSE HE IS JUST ON THE SIDE OF JUSTICE OR IS IT BECAUSE HE THINKS TRACY WILL FEEL BETTER FOR CONFESSING? HE TELLS TRACY THAT SHE SHOULD CONFESS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, OR ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE TO. ROY SPOTS CARLA DRINKING AND LOOKING AT MADDIES MEMORIAL. ROY ASKS, DO YOU THINK DRINKING IS A GOOD IDEA? HER REPLY ALWAYS. CARLA IS DRINKING, AGAIN, THIS TIME IN HER CAR, AND TRACY GETS IN AND SITS BESIDE HER. ALL THIS MOPING ABOUT, THIS WEIRD CRAWLING AROUND LIKE SOME MESSENGER OF DOOM. ITS BORDERLINE SELF INDULGENT, ITS NOT A GOOD LOOK. TRACY PLEADS WITH CARLA, TELLING HER TO STOP BLAMING HERSELF FOR THE DEATHS OF KAL AND MADDIE. SHE TELLS HER THE FIRE WAS AN ACCIDENT. WITH NO WARNING, CARLA HEADS OFF IN HER CAR WITH TRACY AS HER PASSENGER. BUCKLE UP BARLOW, WERE IN FOR A GOOD RIDE. GOODNESS ONLY KNOWS WHAT THE ALCOHOL LEVEL IN CARLS BLOOD MUST BE BY NOW. IT SEEMS SHE HAS BEEN DRINKING NON-STOP FOR WEEKS. TRACY IS CONCERNED THAT CARLAS DRIVING HEAVILY UNDER THE INFLUENCE, BUT CARLA YELLS AT HER, CHILL OUT TRACY, WERE NOT GOING TO CRASH. IVE KILLED ENOUGH PEOPLE FOR ONE LIFETIME. THE 2 WOMEN ARRIVE AT A QUARRY AND CLAMBER UP TO THE EDGE. THIS IS THE PLACE, SHE REVEALS WHERE SHE USED TO PLAY WITH HER BROTHER ROB AND THEIR MATES. SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS ARE CLEARLY AT THE FOREFRONT OF CARLAS MIND. TRACY TELLS HER IT WONT CHANGE ANYTHING IF SHE JUMPS. ITS JUST FATE, SHE SAYS. CARLA CARRIES THE FATE IDEA ON. FATE, YES, RED OR BLACK, HEADS OR TAILS, ITS JUST THE WAY THINGS FALL. HEADS I STAND, TAILS I FALL, SAYS CARLA. IT SEEMS AS IF CARLA IS JUST ABOUT TO GO OVER THE EDGE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE IS A SCREAM OF CARLA! WAIT! I DID IT! CARLA ASKS TRACY WHY SHE BOTHERED TO SAVE HER LIFE WHEN THE BUS CRASHED. SHE ADDS THAT IF TRACY HADNT SAVED HER, KAL AND MADDIE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE. TRACY REVEALS ALL. UNDERSTANDABLY CARLA IS VERY SHOCKED. THE 2 WOMEN ENGAGE IN A TUSSLE. EVENTUALLY THEY ARRIVE BACK ON THE COBBLES AND TRACY HAS TOLD EVERYTHING. HOW SHE STOLE MICHELLES KEYS TO GET INTO CARLAS FLAT AND HOW SHE WANTED CARLAS LIFE TO END, SEEING HER AS THE CAUSE OF ALL HER MISERY, INCLUDING ROBS GOING TO PRISON AND CARLA BUYING THE SHARE OF THE PUB THAT SHE, TRACY, HAD WANTED WITH TONY. TRACY CONFESSES THAT SHE WANTED TO MAKE CARLA PAY. IT SEEMED THAT CARLA HAD EVERYTHING AND THAT SHE, TRACY HAD NOTHING LEFT. AN EXTREMELY (UNDERSTANDABLY) UNFORGIVING CARLA TELLS TRACY, MY STAFF DESPISE ME, MY FRIENDS FEEL SORRY FOR ME, MY BUSINESS IS ON ITS KNEES. IVE THROWN IT ALL AWAY -ALL FOR TAKING THE RAP FOR YOU! ZEEDAN IS PLAYING A BLINDER! WHAT A RESPONSIBLE, THOUGHTFUL AND CONCERNED YOUNG MAN HE HAS BECOME. THE RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN LEANNE AND ZEEDAN IS THOROUGHLY PLAUSIBLE AND A JOY TO SEE. STILL GRIEVING FOR HIS DAD OF COURSE, HE DOES WHAT HIS DAD WOULD HAVE WANTED HIM TO DO AND THAT IS TO LOOK OUT FOR LEANNE. PRAISE TOO TO THE SHARIF FAMILY, AS A WHOLE, FOR WELCOMING LEANNE INTO THEIR FAMILY. LEANNE HAS ALREADY CONFESSED THAT SHE IS FRIGHTENED OF SIMON AND THAT HER STAY IN HOSPITAL IS DUE TO SIMONS VIOLENCE TOWARDS HER. LEANNE, STILL NOT FULLY RECOVERED, ASKS ZEEDAN TO HELP HER FIND SIMON. THIS PLAYS WELL. IT IS FULLY CREDIBLE THAT YOU CAN LOVE SOMEONE DEEPLY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING AFRAID OF THEM AND ALSO BEING ANXIOUS AS TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE AGGRESSOR. AN EXTREMELY UPSET AND WORRIED LEANNE IS ON THE POINT OF REPORTING SIMONS DISAPPEARANCE TO THE POLICE, ON KENS ADVICE WHEN, AMY TELLS THEM THAT HES UPSTAIRS IN HER BEDROOM. LEANNE RUSHES UPSTAIRS TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAS BEEN HIDING IN AMYS WARDROBE, BUT WHEN AMY WAS ASKED IF SHE HAD SEEN HIM OR KNEW WHERE HE WAS, SHE LIED. WE NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOUNG AMY SIMON IS DISTRAUGHT THAT LEANNE HAS TOLD ZEEDAN, WHO SIMON LOOKS UP TO, THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HES DONE. BUT ZEEDAN COVERS FOR LEANNE AND TELLS SIMON THAT HE GUESSED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT HE IS GUTTED. YOURE NOT THE LAD I THOUGHT YOU WERE. MAYBE THAT WILL OPEN SIMONS EYES AND HE WILL REALISE HOW LUCKY HE IS TO HAVE LEANNE AS HIS MUM. ZEEDAN TELLS SIMON THAT HE HAS LOST HIS MUM AND HIS DAD AND THAT SOME DAYS HE WANTS TO PUNCH BRICK WALLS, OTHERS, HE STRUGGLES TO GET OUT OF BED. HE SAYS HE WOULD NEVER LIFT A HAND TO HIS FAMILY. YOURE A GOOD KID SI, DEEP DOWN, I KNOW YOU ARE. ZEEDANS CONCERN FOR HIS FATHERS INTENDED, EVEN EXPANDS TO HIS TURNING UP WITH HIS SLEEPING BAG AND INSISTING HE IS STAYING THE NIGHT AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT SIMON IS NO LONGER A DANGER TO LEANNE. SIMON TELLS HIM, SHE DOESNT NEED A BODY GUARD. ZEEDAN REPLIES, AND YOURE GOING TO PROVE THAT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. ADMIRABLE. UNADMIRABLE IS THE WAY IN WHICH DAVID AND KYLIE ARE PLOTTING TO GET SHUT OF GAIL. THEY REASON THAT IF LILY COULD HAVE HER OWN ROOM THEN THEIR NIGHTS MIGHT BE BETTER. GAIL TELLS SALLY THAT THEY WANT HER OUT. ON SALLYS ADVICE GAIL DECIDES TO CONSULT TONY TO SEE IF IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO CONVERT THE GARAGE INTO A GRANNY FLAT FOR HER TO LIVE IN. SALLY, AU FAIT IN ALL MATTERS MODERN, OR AT LEAST SHE THINKS SHE IS, SAYS ITS NOT FRENCH DOORS, ITS BI-FOLDS AND ALSO THAT THEY ARE THE NEW BLACK. SHE ADDS THAT AN EN SUITE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. GAIL SPEAKS OF ASSISTED LIVING AS THE DEATH OF HOPE. ANNA AND TIM DO SEEM TO BE GETTING ON VERY WELL. THEY ARE BOTH DELIGHTED THAT THEYLL SEE MILEY SOON AND LOOK AT PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER. FAYE IS ASKED TO LOOK AT THE PHOTOGRAPHS BUT JUST SAYS CUTE. SHE IS SINGING THE LONELY GOAT HERD SONG, FROM THE SOUND OF MUSIC IN WHICH SHE WILL PLAY MARIA AND IN WHICH SHE IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED.

15	MADISON, WIS. STRUGGLING TO GENERATE FUNDRAISING AND ENTHUSIASM, REPUBLICAN SCOTT WALKER ABANDONED HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID ON MONDAY, EXITING A TURBULENT RACE THAT SAW HIM RISE TO FRONT-RUNNER AND FALL TO AFTERTHOUGHT IN A MATTER OF MONTHS. THE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR, WHO CAST HIMSELF AS A FIGHTER AND A WINNER, PLANNED TO ANNOUNCE HIS DECISION AT A NEWS CONFERENCE MONDAY EVENING IN MADISON, BECOMING THE SECOND MAJOR GOP CANDIDATE TO QUIT THE RACE. "IT HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED TO ME THAT HE IS GETTING OUT OF THE RACE," SAID IOWA STATE SEN. BRAD ZAUN, WHO ENDORSED WALKER EARLIER THIS YEAR. "I'M PROUD OF OUR EFFORTS IN IOWA. AND I THINK HE'S AN INCREDIBLE CANDIDATE. IT'S UNFORTUNATE." ONE OF THE LAST REPUBLICANS TO ENTER THE RACE, WALKER WILL JOIN FORMER TEXAS GOV. RICK PERRY AS ONE OF THE FIRST TO LEAVE IT, HAVING BEEN UNABLE TO ADJUST TO THE POPULARITY OF BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN DONALD TRUMP OR BREAK OUT IN EITHER OF GOP'S FIRST TWO DEBATES. YET COMPARED TO PERRY, WALKER'S FALL WAS DRAMATIC. HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE A TOP-TIER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR AND BUILT A MASSIVE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION, WITH PAID STAFF SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THAT DWARFED MANY OF HIS RIVALS IN SCALE AND SCOPE. "I'M NOT SURE WHAT WENT WRONG," SAID IOWA STATE SEN. MARK COSTELLO, WHO ENDORSED WALKER EARLIER THIS YEAR. "I DON'T THINK HE MADE ANY REALLY BIG MISTAKES, BUT PEOPLE LOST ENTHUSIASM." HE WILL RETURN TO HIS JOB IN WISCONSIN AS GOVERNOR, WHERE HIS TERM RUNS THROUGH 2018. WALKER, 47, TRIED TO APPEAL TO RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES, TEA PARTY CONSERVATIVES AND THE MORE TRADITIONAL GOP BASE. HE TRIED TO CAST HIMSELF AS AN UNINTIMIDATED CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER WHO HAD A RECORD OF VICTORIES IN A STATE THAT HASN'T VOTED REPUBLICAN FOR PRESIDENT SINCE 1984. HE CAME TO THE RACE HAVING WON ELECTION IN WISCONSIN THREE TIMES IN FOUR YEARS, AND HAVING GAINED A NATIONAL FOLLOWING AMONG DONORS AND CONSERVATIVES BY SUCCESSFULLY PUSHING HIS STATE TO STRIP UNION BARGAINING RIGHTS FROM ITS PUBLIC WORKERS. WALKER POINTED TO THOSE WISCONSIN WINS, IN A STATE THAT TWICE VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA AS PRESIDENT, AS SIGNS THAT HE COULD SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE A CONSERVATIVE AGENDA AS THE GOP'S WHITE HOUSE NOMINEE. HE CALLED HIMSELF "AGGRESSIVELY NORMAL" AND CAMPAIGNED ON A HARLEY-DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE, AND MADE A SPLASH IN JANUARY WITH A WELL-RECEIVED SPEECH BEFORE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES IN IOWA. GROUPS BACKING WALKER WENT ON TO RAISE $26 MILLION, TAPPING WEALTHY DONORS WHOM WALKER HAD CULTIVATED IN HIS YEARS AS GOVERNOR AND DURING HIS SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO WIN A RECALL ELECTION IN 2012. WALKER'S PRIMARY SUPER PAC, CALLED UNINTIMIDATED, HAD JUST BEGUN SPENDING, MAKING A MAJOR PUSH IN IOWA REFLECTING THE GOVERNOR'S LAST-DITCH STRATEGY TO PLACE ALL OF HIS CHIPS ON THAT FIRST-TO-VOTE STATE. THE SUPER PAC TOLD FEDERAL REGULATORS IN A FILING FRIDAY THAT IT HAD SPENT MORE THAN $1.6 MILLION BOOSTING WALKER THIS YEAR, MOST RECENTLY ON A $50,000 MAILING TO IOWA VOTERS. BUT WALKER WAS UNABLE TO ADJUST TO TRUMP'S RISE AND REPEATEDLY HAD TROUBLE CLEARLY STATING HIS POSITION ON SEVERAL ISSUES. HE TOOK DAYS TO CLARIFY WHETHER HE SUPPORTED ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP. HE INITIALLY SHOWED INTEREST IN BUILDING A WALL BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CANADA, ONLY TO LATER LAUGH IT OFF AS RIDICULOUS. WALKER ALSO DECLARED HE WASN'T A CAREER POLITICIAN, DESPITE HAVING HELD PUBLIC OFFICE FOR 22 STRAIGHT YEARS. AFTER TRUMP, BEN CARSON AND CARLY FIORINA DISPLACED WALKER AT THE TOP OF THE POLLS, WALKER TOOK A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH, PROMISING TO "WREAK HAVOC" ON WASHINGTON. HE VOWED TO TAKE ON UNIONS AS PRESIDENT, JUST AS HE DID AS WISCONSIN GOVERNOR, OUTLAWING THEM FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS AND MAKING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY RIGHT-TO-WORK. BUT THE ANTI-UNION POLICY PROPOSAL FELL FLAT; ANNOUNCED IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE SECOND GOP DEBATE, IT WASN'T MENTIONED AT ALL BY WALKER OR ANYONE ELSE ON STAGE. WHILE ONLY TEXAS SEN. TED CRUZ AND FORMER FLORIDA GOV. JEB BUSH HAD MORE SUPER PAC MONEY AVAILABLE TO BOOST THEIR CHANCES IN THE ORIGINAL 17-PERSON 2016 REPUBLICAN FIELD, WALKER STRUGGLED TO GENERATE MONEY FOR HIS OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN. HE HAS YET TO REPORT FUNDRAISING TOTALS TO FEDERAL REGULATORS, BUT TOP FUNDRAISERS AND DONORS HAVE SAID HIS PLUMMETING POLL NUMBERS LEFT THEM STRUGGLING TO GENERATE CASH. WALKER CALLED HIS SENIOR STAFF TO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION IN MADISON ON MONDAY TO REVIEW RECENT POLLING, IN WHICH HE WAS MIRED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GOP FIELD, AND HIS CAMPAIGN'S FINANCES. "I'M DISAPPOINTED," SAID STANLEY HUBBARD, A BILLIONAIRE MEDIA MOGUL FROM MINNEAPOLIS WHO HAD BACKED WALKER'S CAMPAIGN. "HE'S A GOOD MAN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD PRESIDENT." AS WORD SPREAD OF HIS DECISION TO EXIT THE RACE, REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES IN IOWA WORKING FOR OTHER CAMPAIGNS WERE ALREADY MAKING PLANS TO CONTACT STATE LAWMAKERS WHO HAD COMMITTED TO SUPPORT WALKER. THE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR HAD ASSEMBLED A CAMPAIGN ORGANIZATION IN EVERY ONE OF IOWA'S 99 COUNTIES AND HAD A NUMBER OF STATE LAWMAKERS COMMITTED TO HIM. CLIFF HURST, ONE OF WALKER'S NEW HAMPSHIRE CO-CHAIRS, WAS ALREADY PLANNING TO SHIFT TO FLORIDA SEN. MARCO RUBIO'S CAMPAIGN. HE SAID HE KNEW ABOUT THREE DAYS AGO THAT "IT WAS OVER" AND HAD BEEN DISCUSSING AN ENDORSEMENT OF RUBIO AS OF MONDAY MORNING, BEFORE WALKER'S ANNOUNCEMENT BECAME OFFICIAL. "IT WAS PERSONALLY HARD, BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S OVER. I KNEW WHEN IT WAS OVER," HURST SAID. "I'M SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ARE @ LESS THAN 1 PERCENT THAT YOU'VE NOT GOING TO GET ANY MONEY." WALKER, ONE OF THE MOST DIVISIVE POLITICAL FIGURES IN WISCONSIN HISTORY, WILL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO REPAIRING HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH VOTERS IN HIS HOME STATE. HIS JOB APPROVAL RATINGS FELL DRAMATICALLY DURING HIS PRESIDENTIAL RUN, HITTING THEIR LOWEST MARK EVER OF 39 PERCENT IN AN AUGUST POLL CONDUCTED BY MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY. WISCONSIN STATE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER ROBIN VOS, A REPUBLICAN AND CLOSE ALLY OF WALKER'S, SAID HE "HAS AN AMAZING STORY TO TELL ABOUT WISCONSIN AND THE REFORMS WE PUT INTO PLACE." BUT VOS SAID HE SUSPECTS WALKER REALIZED HE WOULD HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME TAKING ATTENTION AWAY FROM OTHER CANDIDATES, LIKE TRUMP, WHO ARE "SUCKING UP A LOT OF THE OXYGEN."
16	NORTH CARROLL HIGH SCHOOL HONORED ED POWELSON SIX YEARS AGO BY NAMING ITS STADIUM FIELD AFTER THE MAN WHO DEVOTED ALMOST ALL OF HIS ADULT LIFE TO HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS IN HAMPSTEAD, AND SEVERAL COUNTY SPORTS FIGURES ATTENDED THE CEREMONY. ONE OF THEM WAS GEORGE WUNDER, A 1992 NORTH CARROLL GRAD AND LONGTIME BASKETBALL COACH AT CENTURY HIGH. HE WANTED THE PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE TO KNOW HOW MUCH POWELSON IMPACTED HIS LIFE, AND MANY OTHERS, AS A COACH, ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, AND ROLE MODEL. "NO ONE EVER CARED ABOUT NORTH CARROLL MORE," WUNDER SAID THAT DAY, "THAN MR. POWELSON." LRELATED WESTMINSTERASCENSION EPISCOPAL CHURCH HOLDS BLESSING OF THE ANIMALSSEE ALL RELATED 8 POWELSON, ONE OF CARROLL COUNTY'S MORE RECOGNIZABLE SPORTS FIGURES, DIED SUNDAY AFTER A LONG BATTLE WITH CANCER. HE WAS 77. POWELSON COACHED BOYS SOCCER AT NORTH CARROLL FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS AND FINISHED HIS COACHING CAREER WITH 274 WINS THE MOST IN STATE HISTORY FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL COACH WHEN HE RETIRED IN 1995 TO GO WITH 46 COMBINED COUNTY, CONFERENCE AND REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS. HE WAS INDUCTED INTO THE CARROLL COUNTY SPORTS HALL OF FAME IN 2001, AND LATER THIS WEEK NORTH CARROLL WILL BEGIN ITS SEVENTH FALL SPORTS SEASON WITH GAMES PLAYED ON POWELSON FIELD. CCOMMENTS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY? START THE CONVERSATION AND BE THE FIRST TO COMMENT. ADD A COMMENT 0 TROY WAREHIME, NORTH CARROLL'S ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, SPOKE DURING A CEREMONY IN 2006 WHEN POWELSON BECAME THE FIRST MEMBER OF NC'S SPORTS HALL OF FAME. THREE YEARS LATER, HE SPOKE AGAIN AT THE POWELSON FIELD DEDICATION CEREMONY. WAREHIME IS PLANNING TO SAY SOME WORDS ABOUT POWELSON LATER THIS WEEK AT ONE OF POWELSON'S MEMORIAL SERVICES. "THIS TIME WON'T BE SO EASY," WAREHIME SAID. "HE WAS MY HERO." POWELSON HAILED FROM RIDGELEY, WEST VIRGINIA, GRADUATED FROM FAIRMONT STATE COLLEGE IN 1959, AND CAME TO CARROLL COUNTY IN 1961, WHEN HE TOOK A JOB TEACHING PHYSICAL EDUCATION AT HAMPSTEAD ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS. HE DECLINED AN OFFER TO BECOME A PE TEACHER AT NORTH CARROLL HIGH THE FOLLOWING YEAR. WHEN IT WAS OFFERED AGAIN THE NEXT YEAR, HE ACCEPTED. "I FIGURED THEY WOULDN'T ASK THREE TIMES," POWELSON SAID IN A 1997 TIMES ARTICLE. POWELSON COACHED TRACK AND FIELD, BASKETBALL, AND SOCCER TO START, THEN ADDED GYMNASTICS TO HIS RESUME. HE ALSO INHERITED ATHLETIC DIRECTOR DUTIES, EVEN THOUGH SUCH A POSITION DIDN'T REALLY EXIST BACK THEN. "I WAS THE ONLY COACH," POWELSON SAID IN THE 1997 ARTICLE. "AND YOU DID ALL THE SCHEDULING, YOU DID EVERYTHING, EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T CALLED ATHLETIC DIRECTORS AND WE DIDN'T GET PAID A CENT FOR ANY OF IT, WHICH WAS FINE. "THAT WASN'T A PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT WASN'T WHY YOU GET IN TEACHING OR COACHING. YOU WERE IN IT FOR THE LOVE OF IT." POWELSON'S BOYS SOCCER TEAMS WON 20 COUNTY TITLES BETWEEN 1961 AND 1988 AND ENJOYED A 46-GAME WINNING STREAK. HE STEPPED AWAY FROM COACHING IN 1995, AND LEFT HIS POST AS ATHLETIC DIRECTOR IN 1997, WRAPPING UP A TEACHING AND COACHING CAREER THAT SPANNED FOUR DECADES. "HE TAUGHT KIDS, HE TAUGHT THEIR PARENTS, AND HE MIGHT HAVE TAUGHT A FEW OF THEIR GRANDPARENTS," WAREHIME SAID. POWELSON HELPED INTRODUCE THE ATHLETIC TRAINER PROGRAM TO CARROLL IN THE 1980S; HE HELPED FORM THE MONOCACY VALLEY ATHLETIC LEAGUE IN 1972 AND THE CENTRAL MARYLAND CONFERENCE IN THE '80S; AND HE WAS INDUCTED INTO THE MARYLAND STATE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR HALL OF FAME IN 1998. "THEY SORT OF BROKE THE MOLD WITH ED," SAID JIM RODRIGUEZ, CARROLL'S SUPERVISOR OF ATHLETICS, AT THE 2009 FIELD-NAMING CEREMONY. "IT'S ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE HE TOUCHED AND THE LIFE LESSONS HE GAVE THEM BEYOND THE FIELD." WHEN NORTH CARROLL'S FOOTBALL TEAM HAD THE FIRST HOME PLAYOFF CONTEST IN ITS HISTORY LAST FALL, POWELSON WAS ON HAND TO TAKE PART IN THE PRE-GAME COIN FLIP. HE WAS ALREADY INTO HIS FIGHT AGAINST PROSTATE CANCER AT THE TIME, BUT POWELSON RARELY MISSED A SPORTING EVENT AT EITHER NORTH CARROLL OR MANCHESTER VALLEY. HIS DAUGHTER, DENEAN KOONTZ, IS NORTH CARROLL'S FIELD HOCKEY COACH. HIS SON-IN-LAW, BERNIE KOONTZ, COACHES BASKETBALL AT MANCHESTER VALLEY. DENEAN KOONTZ SAID IT SERVED HER FATHER WELL DURING A DIFFICULT TIME BEING ABLE TO WATCH THE PANTHERS' FIELD HOCKEY TEAM WIN THE LAST TWO CLASS 1A STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS, WITH HIS GRANDDAUGHTER JENSYN KOONTZ AS A STANDOUT. "HE DOESN'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY," DENEAN KOONTZ SAID. "HE KEPT FIGHTING UNTIL THE DAY HE PASSED AWAY. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO MY FATHER ... WAS HIS FAMILY. FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THE PAST [FEW] YEARS WITH THEM, AND TO SEE ALL OF THOSE THINGS, WAS VERY, VERY SPECIAL." PAT.STOETZER@CARROLLCOUNTYTIMES.COM 410-857-7894 TWITTER.COM/CARROLLVARSITY FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS VISITATION FOR ED POWELSON IS SCHEDULED FOR 2-5 AND 7-9 P.M. WEDNESDAY AT ELINE FUNERAL HOME, 934 S.

17	ROB HALFORD LOOKS BACK ON PMRC: 'WE GOT ATTACKED FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER' SEPTEMBER 27, 2015 0 COMMENTS BACK IN THE MID-'80S, THE PMRC (PARENTS' MUSIC RESOURCE CENTER) PUBLISHED A LIST CALLED "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN" WHICH CONSISTED OF THE TOP FIFTEEN SONGS THEY WANTED BANNED DUE TO OBJECTIONABLE LYRICS SUGGESTING VIOLENCE, SEX, DRUGS, ALCOHOL OR THE OCCULT. THEY PETITIONED FOR LYRICS TO BE PRINTED ON THE ALBUM JACKETS AND NO ONE WAS SAFE HEAVY METAL ACTS WERE RIGHT THERE ALONGSIDE THE POP STARS. AC/DC, MADONNA, MTLEY CRE, JUDAS PRIEST, PRINCE, W.A.S.P., MERCYFUL FATE, VANITY, DEF LEPPARD, CYNDI LAUPER AND TWISTED SISTER ALL MADE "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN" LIST. IN NOVEMBER 1985, THE RIAA (RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA) AGREED TO PUT "PARENTAL ADVISORY: EXPLICIT LYRICS" LABELS ON SELECTED RELEASES AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION. ASKED WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO HAVE THE JUDAS PRIEST TRACK "EAT ME ALIVE" INCLUDED IN "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN," THE BAND'S LEAD SINGER, ROB HALFORD, TOLD CANADA'S C103 RADIO STATION: "IT WAS KIND OF TOUGH, BECAUSE WE GOT ATTACKED FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER. NONE OF US THAT ARE ON THAT LIST SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE, BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME SEE A BAND LIKE PRIEST OR MY MATE DEE [SNIDER] FROM TWISTED SISTER, WE WANNA GIVE YOU A GOOD TIME, WE WANNA HELP YOU FORGET ALL THE TROUBLES AND THE WORRIES IN THE WORLD. WE WANT YOU TO COME AND ENJOY YOURSELF, HAVE A FEW DRINKS, MEET YOUR MATES, HAVE A GREAT METAL EXPERIENCE, ROCK AND ROLL EXPERIENCE. SO, TO BE ACCUSED OF THAT WAS PRETTY LOW, BUT WE GOT THROUGH IT AND WE BATTLED ON, AND I THINK WE HAD A WIN FOR EVERYBODY IN THAT RESPECT." HALFORD ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE WAY SOCIETY HAS BECOME, IN HIS VIEW, TOO POLITICALLY CORRECT. HE SAID: "WELL, AGAIN, I COULD TALK FOREVER ON THAT SUBJECT. YOU KNOW, YEAH, I THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF GIVE EACH OTHER A BREAK AND KIND OF TAKE A LONG, DEEP BREATH AND LET IT OUT VERY SLOWLY, BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE CAN GET ATTENTION IN THESE TIMES IS TO SCREAM AS LOUD AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND TO SAY THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. SO IT'S A PITY, REALLY. IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD FROM WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AS A KID. BUT, HEY, THAT'S THE WAY HUMANITY IS EVOLVING, UNFORTUNATELY. AND IT'S NOT JUST IN THE STATES; IT'S EVERYWHERE. THERE'S THIS CRAZY CACOPHONY GOING ON. BUT LEAVE ALL THAT STUFF TO THE POLITICIANS AND TO ALL THE THE KIND OF NOISE THAT WE MAKE IN METAL IS THE BEST NOISE YOU CAN GET PLAIN AND SIMPLE." JUDAS PRIEST IS CONTINUING TO TOUR IN SUPPORT OF ITS LATEST ALBUM, "REDEEMER OF SOULS", WHICH WAS RELEASED IN JULY 2014. THE FOLLOW-UP TO 2008'S DOUBLE-DISC CONCEPT ALBUM "NOSTRADAMUS" WAS BILLED AS A RETURN TO JUDAS PRIEST'S HEAVY-METAL ROOTS. "REDEEMER OF SOULS" SOLD AROUND 32,000 COPIES IN THE UNITED STATES IN ITS FIRST WEEK OF RELEASE TO LAND AT POSITION NO. 6 ON THE BILLBOARD 200 CHART.

18	PEYTON MANNING'S SUMMER WAS BOTH DAZZLING AND PERPLEXING. PRACTICES CONSISTED OF SPRINT-OUTS, ROLL-OUTS AND BOOTLEGS FROM UNDER CENTER, PLAY-ACTION PASSES FROM THE PISTOL FORMATION AND SCRAMBLES FOR FIRST DOWNS IN DEFIANCE OF HIS 39-YEAR-OLD LEGS. PRESEASON GAMES WERE FILLED WITH EMPTY BACKFIELDS AND SHOTGUN FORMATIONS THAT PRODUCED A PAUCITY OF POINTS AND PLENTY OF ANGST AMONG BRONCOS FANS AND FANTASY FOOTBALL OWNERS ALIKE. WHICH MANNING SHOWS UP SUNDAY IS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE. "THE LAST THREE YEARS HE'S BEEN HERE, THERE WERE (PRESEASON) GAMES WE DIDN'T SCORE POINTS AND WE'D COME OUT AND SCORE 35, 42 POINTS" IN THE OPENER, WIDE RECEIVER DEMARYIUS THOMAS SAID. "SO, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BY DESIGN OR NOT, BUT IT HAPPENS." IF MANNING IS CONCERNED THAT HE DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN AUGUST, HE DIDN'T SHOW IT WEDNESDAY. "HEY, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SUNDAY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM," MANNING SAID. "WE'VE GOT SOME NEW GUYS PLAYING AND WE'VE GOT SOME NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO. I'VE SAID ALL ALONG THE KEY FOR US IS TO IMPROVE THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF A GAME. "BALTIMORE'S AN EXCELLENT DEFENSE. ARE YOU GOING TO DOMINATE ALL FOUR QUARTERS? I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S EVER DONE THAT AGAINST BALTIMORE, BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WIN ENOUGH PLAYS AND BE EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO WIN THE FOOTBALL GAME." RAVENS COACH JOHN HARBAUGH SAID ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES HE'S FACING THIS WEEK AS HE PREPARES FOR THE OPENER WAS FIGURING OUT HOW BRONCOS COACH GARY KUBIAK, HIS FORMER OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WAS ADAPTING HIS SCHEME TO FIT MANNING'S SKILLS. "THE TEAMS THAT PLAY HIM IN WEEK 3 AND 4 AND 5 AND 6 AND DOWN THE ROAD WILL HAVE A BETTER FEEL FOR THAT THAN WE WILL," HARBAUGH SAID. "I'M SURE THAT THEY DIDN'T SHOW IN THE PRESEASON EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE PLANNING ON DOING." THE BRONCOS SHOWED ALMOST NOTHING IN THE PRESEASON, IN PART BECAUSE MANNING NEVER HAD PRO BOWL RECEIVERS THOMAS AND EMMANUEL SANDERS TOGETHER WITH HIM ON THE FIELD. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO USE TRAINING CAMP TO GET A FEEL FOR THE FUTURE. GENERAL MANAGER JOHN ELWAY SAID HE LIKED WHAT HE SAW IN BROCK OSWEILER, WHO'S ENTERING HIS FOURTH SEASON AS MANNING'S BACKUP. HE ALSO LIKED ROOKIE TREVOR SIEMIAN, SO MUCH SO THAT HE HAD TO KEEP THE FORMER NORTHWESTERN QB ON THE 53-MAN ROSTER RATHER THAN RISK TRYING TO SLIP HIM THROUGH TO THE PRACTICE SQUAD. MANNING MADE CAMEOS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD EXHIBITION GAMES AND DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN NINE FULL POSSESSIONS. HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PLAYED MORE AND BETTER BUT WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS PREPARATION FOR HIS 18TH NFL SEASON. HARBAUGH MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO EXPECT SUNDAY, BUT HE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF KUBIAK AND HIS TOP LIEUTENANT, RICK DENNISON, LAST YEAR, RAVENS QUARTERBACK JOE FLACCO HAD THE BEST SEASON OF HIS SEVEN-YEAR CAREER. "I'M SURE THAT PEYTON IS HAVING A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM," FLACCO SAID. "... THEY JUST HELPED ME PLAY FAST, PLAY WITH A QUIET MIND, BE CONFIDENT AND MAKE QUICK DECISIONS. I THINK THAT OUR LINE PLAYED REALLY WELL LAST YEAR UNDER THEIR PROTECTION SCHEME AND I THINK THAT HELPED OUT A TON." THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR MANNING, WHO HAS FOUR NEW O-LINEMEN, INCLUDING TWO NOVICES IN LEFT TACKLE TY SAMBRAILO AND CENTER MATT PARADIS. RAVENS RUNNING BACK JUSTIN FORSETT WENT FROM JOURNEYMAN TO PRO BOWLER IN KUBIAK'S ZONE BLOCKING SCHEME LAST YEAR, AND HARBAUGH SAID DENVER PRO BOWLER C.J. ANDERSON SHOULD BE IN FOR A SIMILARLY SPECTACULAR SEASON. "HE'S A DOWNHILL, ONE-CUT, VERY PHYSICAL GUY," HARBAUGH SAID. "DIFFERENT KINDS OF BACKS ARE GOOD IN THIS SCHEME, BUT THEY'VE GOT TWO OF THEM. RONNIE HILLMAN DOES IT DIFFERENTLY THAN C.J. DOES IT. I THINK THEY'VE GOT TWO GUYS WITH DIFFERENT STYLES THAT RUN THE SCHEME VERY WELL." NOTES: PLAYERS VOTED MANNING, DE DEMARCUS WARE AND S DAVID BRUTON JR. AS TEAM CAPTAINS. ... DE KENNY ANUNIKE (KNEE) WAS THE ONLY PLAYER TO SIT OUT PRACTICE. --- AP NFL WEBSITE: WWW.PRO32.AP.ORG AND WWW.TWITTER.COM/AP-NFL
19	NINETEEN COMMONWEALTH BANK CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCEPTED COMPENSATION FROM A BANK SCHEME FOR VICTIMS OF BAD FINANCIAL ADVICE SINCE ITS LAUNCH LAST YEAR, NEW FIGURES SHOW. AN UPDATE ON THURSDAY SAID CBA'S OPEN ADVICE REVIEW, WHICH WAS CLOSED TO NEW APPLICANTS IN JULY, HAD PROMPTED 8835 CUSTOMERS TO REGISTER FOR A FREE FILE REVIEW INTO WHETHER THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION. HOWEVER, IN A SIGN OF THE PAINSTAKING REVIEW PROCESS, A MINORITY OF FILES HAVE BEEN ASSESSED SO FAR, AND THE NUMBER OF SETTLED CASES IS EVEN LOWER. THE REPORT, BY EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS PROMONTORY FINANCIAL GROUP, SAID THAT AT THE END OF AUGUST, 686 CASES HAD BEEN ASSESSED BY THE BANK. OF THIS GROUP, THE BANK HAD OFFERED COMPENSATION IN 53 CASES, OR 8 PER CENT OF ALL CASES ASSESSED. THE COMPENSATION SO FAR OFFERED BY THE BANK IS WORTH $950,252 IN TOTAL. AMONG THE 53 CUSTOMERS OFFERED A PAYOUT, 19 PEOPLE HAD ACCEPTED THE COMPENSATION, 11 HAD REJECTED THE OFFER AND 23 WERE STILL REVIEWING THE BANK'S PROPOSAL. THE BANK HAS PAID OUT $488,815 IN COMPENSATION UNDER THE SCHEME, UP FROM $79,702 AT THE END OF APRIL. CBA LAST YEAR OPENED UP THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM. IT ALLOWS ANY CUSTOMER OF COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL PLANNING AND FINANCIAL WISDOM BETWEEN 2003 AND 2012 TO HAVE THEIR FILES REVIEWED. IT FOLLOWED A DAMNING SENATE INQUIRY THAT FOUND THE BANK HAD UNDERPAID VICTIMS OF A SCANDAL, SOUGHT TO AVOID SCRUTINY, AND COVERED UP THE MISCONDUCT. "THE PROGRAM'S PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE CUSTOMERS WHO RECEIVED POOR ADVICE ARE PUT BACK IN THE POSITION THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY RECEIVED APPROPRIATE ADVICE, AND TO GIVE REASSURANCE TO OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT THE ADVICE THEY RECEIVED WAS APPROPRIATE," CBA SAID. IN APRIL, CBA CHIEF EXECUTIVE IAN NAREV SAID THE "PAINSTAKING" INVESTIGATION INTO PAST FILES WOULD TAKE UP TO MOST OF 2016. CBA SAID IT HAD INCREASED THE NUMBER OF STAFF WORKING ON THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM BY 100 SINCE MAY TO 613, ALLOWING IT TO SORT THROUGH MORE CUSTOMER FILES. WHILE IT CATALOGUED MORE THAN 900,000 CUSTOMER FILES IN THE FOUR MONTHS TO AUGUST, IT SAID THAT RETRIEVING FILES FOR FINANCIAL WISDOM CUSTOMERS WAS A "CHALLENGE" AND IT WAS STILL RELYING ON HARD COPY FILES IN SOME CASES. SEPARATELY FROM THIS COMPENSATION SCHEME, CBA HAD PAID OUT ABOUT $52 MILLION TO 1100 CUSTOMERS OF SPECIFIC ADVISERS WHO WERE IDENTIFIED FOR HAVING PROVIDED SHODDY ADVICE, MAINLY BETWEEN 2008 AND 2

21	U.S. SPACE AGENCY NASA ANNOUNCED ON MONDAY IT HAS FOUND "STRONG" EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS LIQUID WATER INTERMITTENTLY FLOWING ON PRESENT-DAY MARS. IMAGES TAKEN FROM THE MARS ORBIT SHOWED DARK, FINGER-LIKE MARKINGS THAT, TYPICALLY LESS THAN FIVE METERS IN WIDTH, APPEAR ON SLOPES DURING WARM SEASONS, LENGTHEN AND THEN FADE DURING COOLER SEASONS ON THE RED PLANET. THESE SURFACE FEATURES, KNOWN AS RECURRING SLOPE LINEAE (RSL), HAVE BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO FORM BY THE ACTIVITY OF BRINES, BUT DIRECT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN LACKING. NOW, USING AN IMAGING SPECTROMETER FROM NASA'S MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO), RESEARCHERS DETECTED SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED MINERALS ON SLOPES WHERE THE MYSTERIOUS STREAKS ARE SEEN ON MARS. "OUR QUEST ON MARS HAS BEEN TO 'FOLLOW THE WATER,' IN OUR SEARCH FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, AND NOW WE HAVE CONVINCING SCIENCE THAT VALIDATES WHAT WE'VE LONG SUSPECTED," SAID JOHN GRUNSFELD, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR OF NASA'S SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE IN WASHINGTON. "THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT, AS IT APPEARS TO CONFIRM THAT WATER -- ALBEIT BRINY -- IS FLOWING TODAY ON THE SURFACE OF MARS." THESE PUZZLING SURFACE FEATURES WERE FIRST NOTICED IN 2010 BY LUJENDRA OJHA, THEN A UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT, USING IMAGES FROM THE MRO'S HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING SCIENCE EXPERIMENT. IN THE NEW STUDY, OJHA, NOW A GRADUATE STUDENT AT GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, AND HIS COLLEAGUES ANALYZED SPECTRA DATA FROM THE COMPACT RECONNAISSANCE IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM) ABOARD THE MRO FROM FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHERE THE RSL FEATURES WERE PRESENT. THEY REPORTED IN THE BRITISH JOURNAL NATURE GEOSCIENCE THAT SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED SALTS AT THESE RSL LOCATIONS EXISTED ONLY WHEN THE DARK FEATURES WERE RELATIVELY WIDE. "WE FOUND THE HYDRATED SALTS ONLY WHEN THE SEASONAL FEATURES WERE WIDEST, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT EITHER THE DARK STREAKS THEMSELVES OR A PROCESS THAT FORMS THEM IS THE SOURCE OF THE HYDRATION," OJHA SAID. "IN EITHER CASE, THE DETECTION OF HYDRATED SALTS ON THESE SLOPES MEANS THAT WATER PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THESE STREAKS." THE RESEARCHERS INTERPRETED THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES AS CAUSED BY HYDRATED MINERALS CALLED PERCHLORATES, WHICH ARE LIKELY A MIXTURE OF MAGNESIUM PERCHLORATE, MAGNESIUM CHLORATE AND SODIUM PERCHLORATE. SOME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO KEEP LIQUIDS FROM FREEZING EVEN WHEN CONDITIONS ARE AS COLD AS MINUS 94 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT (MINUS 70 CELSIUS), NASA SAID. ON EARTH, NATURALLY PRODUCED PERCHLORATES ARE CONCENTRATED IN DESERTS, AND SOME TYPES OF PERCHLORATES CAN BE USED AS ROCKET PROPELLANT. PERCHLORATES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN ON MARS. FOR EXAMPLE, NASA'S PHOENIX LANDER AND CURIOSITY ROVER BOTH FOUND THEM IN THE PLANET'S SOIL, AND SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THAT THE VIKING MISSIONS IN THE 1970S MEASURED SIGNATURES OF THESE SALTS. "HOWEVER, THIS STUDY OF RSL DETECTED PERCHLORATES, NOW IN HYDRATED FORM, IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAN THOSE EXPLORED BY THE LANDERS," NASA SAID. "THIS ALSO IS THE FIRST TIME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM ORBIT." FOR OJHA, THE NEW FINDINGS ARE MORE PROOF THAT THE MYSTERIOUS LINES HE FIRST SAW DARKENING MARTIAN SLOPES FIVE YEARS AGO ARE, INDEED, PRESENT-DAY WATER. "WHEN MOST PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WATER ON MARS, THEY'RE USUALLY TALKING ABOUT ANCIENT WATER OR FROZEN WATER," HE SAID. "NOW WE KNOW THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY. THIS IS THE FIRST SPECTRAL DETECTION THAT UNAMBIGUOUSLY SUPPORTS OUR LIQUID WATER-FORMATION HYPOTHESES FOR RSL."
22	EACH DAY WE SEE THE EFFORT OF UNIONS TO FORCE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY FARM WORKERS TO PAY BRIBES TO WORK. THEN YOU HAVE THE EFFORT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES ARE FORCING WORKERS TO SPEND MORE ON WORKING CONDITIONS. THEN YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR FARMS, ESPECIALLY IF A NEW PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. THE SOLUTION IS ROBOTS AND MACHINES TO DO THE PICKING AND HARVESTING OF CROPS. WHILE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE NEW MACHINES, THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SO. YEARS AGO UC DAVIS DEVELOPED A TOMATO PICKING MACHINEBUT THE UNIONS STOPPED ITS DEVELOPMENT. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. AGAIN, AMERICA CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN AGRICULTURE INTERNATIONALLY. WE CAN INNOVATE AND FEED THE HUNGRY MASSES BY MAKING FOOD AVAILABILITY MORE RELIABLE AND LOW COST. 4 LABOR-INTENSIVE CROPS FARMERS WISH THEY HAD ROBOTS TO HARVEST ELIZA BARCLAY, KPBS, 9/7/15 THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION SAYS MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO PICK HOT AND BELL PEPPERS COULD HELP SOLVE LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEMS. IF YOURE ENJOYING A LATE-SUMMER FRUIT PIE THIS LABOR DAY, CONSIDER WHAT WENT INTO GROWING AND HARVESTING THAT FRUIT. CHANCES ARE, IT TOOK A LOT OF HUMAN HANDS TO ENSURE ITS SKIN WOULD BE PERFECT AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. WHILE MACHINES HAVE REPLACED HUMAN HANDS FOR A LOT OF FARM JOBS THE HARVESTING OF TOMATOES FOR PROCESSING, THE CUTTING OF LETTUCE AND SPINACH, THE SHAKING OF ALMOND TREES TO MAKE THE NUTS FALL TO THE GROUND MANY FRUIT, VEGETABLE AND NUT FARMERS STILL RELY HEAVILY ON PEOPLE TO PLANT, MAINTAIN AND HARVEST THEIR CROPS. MACHINES DONT YET EXIST FOR THESE CROPS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN AMPLE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK, AND BECAUSE ITS HARD TO DESIGN MACHINES THAT CAN CUT OR PICK THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLES WITHOUT SQUISHING OR DAMAGING THEM TOO MUCH. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. ALL THATS CREATED A NEW PUSH FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO MECHANIZATION TO REPLACE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME FILLING. THERES AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF FRESH-MARKET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS, MATTHEW WHITING , AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND EXTENSION SPECIALIST AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEET CHERRY INDUSTRY, TELLS THE SALT. THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED HARVEST LABOR IS ON EVERY GROWERS MIND. FOR LABOR DAY, WE THOUGHT WED ROUND UP SOME OF THE CROPS THAT CANT YET BE HARVESTED BY A MACHINE, BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE FUTURE. TO BE CLEAR, THE ISSUE OF FARM LABOR IS COMPLICATED. AND MACHINES THAT COULD HARVEST THESE CROPS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE. SWEET CHERRIES THESE ARE THE SOFT, SWEET CHERRIES WE GET IN BAGS WITH THE STEM ATTACHED. AND WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND PLUMP? BECAUSE A HUMAN HAND CAREFULLY PICKED THEM. BUT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER WILLING HANDS TO DO THAT WORK. AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTICED. OF ALL THE PRODUCERS THAT DREAM OF MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO EASE THEIR LABOR WOES, THE SWEET CHERRY GROWERS MIGHT BE THE CLOSEST TO GETTING ONE THANKS TO RESEARCH FUNDING. MATT WHITING SAYS HE AND OTHERS AT WSU ARE CLOSE TO FINDING A COMMERCIAL PARTNER FOR A PROTOTYPE HARVESTER THAT CAN PICK 50 TIMES AS MANY CHERRIES AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD IN THE SAME TIME. STILL, THERES ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS NEW MODEL IS VIABLE: NEW VARIETIES OF CHERRIES SUITED TO THE MECHANICAL HARVESTER WILL NEED TO BE BRED. WHITING SAYS RESEARCH IS HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT IN 10 TO 12 YEARS, SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER GROWERS A SUITE OF NEW VARIETIES. ASPARAGUS AS THE HUFFINGTON POST HAS REPORTED , ASPARAGUS IS UNIQUELY LABOR INTENSIVE BECAUSE THE QUICK-GROWING PLANT MUST BE HARVESTED EVERY DAY OF ITS THREE-MONTH GROWING SEASON. EACH PLANT SPROUTS MULTIPLE SPEARS (THE PART OF THE PLANT WE EAT) A DAY, WHICH HAVE TO BE HAND-CUT EVERY DAY. SO THAT MEANS WORKERS ARE CUTTING 14 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FROM ROUGHLY FEBRUARY TO MAY. BUT VARIOUS MECHANICAL ASPARAGUS HARVESTERS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING THEM. ACCORDING TO A 2009 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT , IF THE U.S. ASPARAGUS INDUSTRY IS TO INSURE A COMPETITIVE POSITION, IT MUST SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGY FOR LABOR TO LOWER PER UNIT COSTS AND SHIFT THE WORKFORCE TO VALUE-ADDED EMPLOYMENT. INSTITUTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW. APPLES COMMERCIAL APPLE PICKING TODAY REQUIRES BRAWN WORKERS HAVE TO FILL BUCKETS ALL DAY LONG WITH HEAVY APPLES AND THEN DUMP THEM INTO BINS. AND ACCORDING TO A FRUIT INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION , THE ERA OF FULLY AUTOMATED ROBOTIC HARVESTERS NAVIGATING [APPLE] ORCHARD ROWS IS STILL YEARS AWAY. WHITING SAYS THATS BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS DEDICATED LITTLE FUNDING DEDICATED TO RESEARCH. THATS CHANGING, THOUGH. THE WASHINGTON STATE TREE FRUIT RESEARCH COMMISSION IS NOW PURSUING MORE RESEARCH ON MECHANICAL HARVESTING. AND THIS YEAR, SOME COMMERCIAL APPLE FARMERS MAY BE USING A VACUUM HARVESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME. ITS DESIGNERS SAY IT SAVES TIME, REDUCES PICKER FATIGUE AND BOOST THE HARVEST YIELD. PEPPERS CALIFORNIA GROWS ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE PEPPERS IN THE U.S., AND LATELY THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION HAS BEEN TALKING MORE DEVELOPING MECHANICAL HARVESTING AND VARIETIES BRED TO BE PICKED BY MACHINES. ACCORDING TO A 2015 REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION, WITH INCREASING COST AND DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF LABOR NEEDED TO PICK PEPPERS, INNOVATION [SIMILAR TO THE PROCESSED TOMATO INDUSTRY] COULD GIVE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. FARMERS SIGNIFICANT RETURNS AND POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PEPPER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA, THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO HAVE FRESH MARKET QUALITY AND MECHANICAL HARVESTING IN BOTH BLOCKY [BELL PEPPERS] AND HOT TYPES.

23	BLOG FALL CHALLENGE REVIEW LETS START BY THROWING OUT A HUGE THANK YOU TO DAVE, CHRIS AND JESSE THE OWNERS OF THE WEST COAST TRIPLE CROWN FOR HOSTING ANOTHER FANTASTIC EVENT. AS ALWAYS IT WAS RIGHT ON SCHEDULE WITH NO LONG BREAKS AND THE PROGRAMMING WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND BATTLE TESTED. MY GUESS IS EVERY WORKOUT WENT EXACTLY HOW THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL THE VOLUNTEERS WHO GAVE UP THEIR TIME TO JUDGE AND HELP SETUP FOR THIS EVENT. I PERSONALLY DONT DO ENOUGH VOLUNTEERING AT LOCAL EVENTS AND I PLAN ON CHANGING THAT IN THE FUTURE AND I HOPE SOME OF YOU WILL AS WELL. EVENT LIKE THESE CANT GO OFF WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE COMMUNITY. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THEY DONT MAKE ENOUGH DOING THESE TO PAY EVERYONE. IT WAS SO AWESOME THAT SO MANY OF YOU LIONS FAITHFUL CAME UP TO SQUAMISH ON A HORRIBLE RAINY WEEKEND TO SUPPORT OUR ATHLETES. VANESSA (AKA MIKE TYSON), KARINA, ANNIE, SCOTT, KATHRYN,JEFF, PAULINE, MRS HARRISON, MY MOM, JOHN ON SATURDAY, CHRISTI ON SATURDAY, OWEN ON SUNDAY. IT REALLY MEANT A TON TO EVERYONE TO HAVE YOU GUYS CHEERING. PERSONALLY I HEARD EVERY CHEER WHILE ON THE FLOOR. SATURDAY THE INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION RECAP: TEAM LIONS FOR SATURDAY WAS GILL FOR THE LADIES AND THEN MYSELF, BRETT, OWEN, SHAYAN AND MIKE. GILL: FINISHED ON THE PODIUM FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WITH A 3RD PLACE OVERALL FINISH. HER WEEKEND WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A DOMINATING FIRST PLACE PERFORMANCE IN THE 5K RUN AND A 4TH PLACE FINISH IN THE CROSSFITTY CROSSFIT WOD. COACH CHRIS: FIRST INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION FOR ME IN THE LAST 5 YEARS (NOT INCLUDING THE OPEN). I FINISHED 7TH OVERALL. MY DAY WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A 3RD PLACE IN CROSSFITTY CROSSFIT WOD AND A 5TH PLACE IN THE 5K RUN. MIKE SWANSON: FIRST TIME COMPETING WITH A CROSSFIT LIONS SHIRT ON HIS BACK. MIKE FINISHED 16TH OVERALL. HIS DAY WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A 9TH PLACE FINISH IN THE KEG CARRY AND A 16TH PLACE FINISH ON THE 5K RUN. OWEN RAY: ALSO FIRST TIME COMPETING AS AN INDIVIDUAL AT A CROSSFIT EVENT. OWEN FINISHED 18TH OVERALL. HE CLAIMED A 4TH PLACE FINISH ON THE KEG CARRY AND A 12TH PLACE FINISH ON SANDBAG WORKOUT. COACH SHAYAN: FINISHED 24TH OVERALL. SHAYAN FINISHED 17TH IN THE MUSCLE UPS EVENT AND 19TH IN THE RUN. BRETT THORNBURN: BRETTS FIRST INDIVIDUAL COMPETIITION. HE FINISHED 19TH ON THE KEG CARRY AND 22ND ON THE RUN. ALL THE INDIVIDUAL ATHLETES DID THE GYM PROUD AND I THINK WE ALL LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE OUR FITNESS IS AT AND WHAT WE NEED TO WORK ON. TEAM COMPETITION ON SUNDAY: TEAMS WERE MADE UP OF 1 MALE AND 1 FEMALE. THE WORKOUTS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THE INDIVIDUAL EVENT HELD ON SATURDAY AND 4 OF US DID BOTH DAYS. HICKS AND HARRISON: GILL AND I FINISHED 4TH OUT OF THE 40 TEAMS COMPETING. IT INCLUDED A FIRST PLACE ON THE RUN EVENT AND A 3RD PLACE ON THE MUSCLE UPS. IT ALSO MUST BE SAID THAT IF I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO PUT TWO FEET ON THE FINISH MAT AFTER MY LAST KEG CARRY WE WOULD HAVE FINISHED THE WEEKEND IN 3RD PLACE. WOOPS. JAME AND ODLUND: COACH JOHN AND HIS LOVELY GIRLFRIEND CAMILA PARTNERED UP AND DID AWESOME WITH AN 11TH PLACE FINISH OVERALL. IT WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A 3RD PLACE FINISH IN THE KEG CARRY AND 11TH PLACE ON THE MUSCLE UPS. CROSS AND SWANSON: STEPH AND MIKE CAME IN IN 18TH PLACE OVERALL. THEIR BEST FINISH WAS A 4TH PLACE ON THE RUN AND 15TH ON THE MUSCLE UP. CHAMBERS AND VAGHAYENEGAR: SHAYAN AND CHRISTI FINISHED 23RD OVERALL. 6TH PLACE ON THE 7K RUN WAS THEIR BEST EVENT AND 15TH ON THE MUSCLE UPS. REALLY PROUD OF ALL OUR TEAMS FROM THIS PAST WEEKEND. IT WAS REALLY FUN HAVING SO MANY OF US IN SUCH A GREAT EVENT. I THINK ITS SAFE TO SAY WE ALL ENJOYED OURSELVES THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE DAY. A COUPLE HICKUPS ALL AROUND (INCLUDING SOME OUT OF OUR CONTROL) BUT OVERALL A VERY ENJOYABLE TIME NO DOUBT. THE CASCADE CLASSIC, THE LARGEST EVENT IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, IS NEXT UP FOR CROSSFIT LIONS. ITS ON THANKSGIVING WEEKEND AND SCOTT AND ANNIE HAVE BOTH QUALIFIED TO COMPETE. THERE WILL BE A CREW OF US HEADING DOWN FOR THE WEEKEND AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US LET ME KNOW. TONS OF TOP CROSSFIT GAMES ATHLETES WILL BE THROWING DOWN.
24	SINGERS NICKI MINAJ AND MILEY CYRUS HAD A PUBLIC SPAT AT THE 2015 VMAS, HOSTED BY MILEY. DURING THE LIVE BROADCAST ON SUNDAY, NICKI CALLED MILEY A "BITCH" FOR TALKING ABOUT HER IN THE PRESS. ACCORDING TO AN INSIDER, "NICKI WAS LIVID WITH MILEY AND DECIDED TO AIR HER FEELINGS ONSTAGE." IN FACT, IT WAS REPORTED THAT MTV STAFFERS HAD TO KEEP NICKI AND MILEY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER FOR THE NIGHT TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION. IT IS HARD TO KNOW IF THEIR FIGHTING WAS STAGED OR AUTHENTIC. EITHER WAY, IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SHOUTING ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS IN PUBLIC WHEN YOU'RE UPSET IS THE BEST WAY TO GET YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS. IN NICKI'S CASE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A STRONG DESIRE TO REACH HER FAN BASE AND SHARE HER RAGE TOWARD MILEY. MAYBE SHE THOUGHT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE FACE. BUT IT REALLY ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING WITH A PARTNER IN FRONT OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS AT A HOLIDAY MEAL. SO WHEN YOU'RE IRKED AT SOMEONE, WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO LET THEM KNOW - TALK TO THEM IN PRIVATE ABOUT IT, OR LET THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW' VERY OFTEN WHEN WE ARE MAD AT SOMEONE WHO HAS HURT OUR FEELINGS OUR INCLINATION IS TO GET BACK AT THEM BY LETTING OTHERS KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO MAKE US FEEL MISTREATED AND WRONGED. IN FACT, THAT DYNAMIC IS THE HOOK OF REALITY TELEVISION. DOING THAT, THOUGH, AND BEING VOCAL ABOUT THE BAD ENERGY BETWEEN YOU MAY UNWITTINGLY PUT THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BY MAKING THEM FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE SIDES. SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET SO CAUGHT UP IN THE ANGER OF THE MOMENT THAT IT CAN SPILLOVER BEYOND THEIR PRIVATE WORLD, AS WE SAW WITH NICKI AND MILEY. BEFORE YOU LET THAT HAPPEN, ASK YOURSELF IF THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP WORTH SAVING. IF YOU DECIDE IT IS, THEN THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO GO RIGHT TO THE SOURCE AND ADDRESS THE CAUSE OF YOUR DISTRESS DIRECTLY WITH THE PERSON WHO UPSET YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE. TELL THEM WHAT THEY SAID AND DID TO SET YOU OFF, AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE AND EXPLAIN. IT WILL ALSO GIVE THE PERSON THE CHANCE TO CLEAR UP ANY MISCOMMUNICATION OR MISUNDERSTANDING THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN YOU. FIGHTING OUT IN THE OPEN JUST SERVES TO FAN THE FLAMES OF THE FURY, BUT A STRAIGHT CONVERSATION MIGHT CLEAR THE AIR AND EVEN HELP TO SALVAGE YOUR RELATIONSHIP. THIS YEAR'S VMAS WERE ALSO WITNESS TO A NUMBER OF BAD FEELINGS BEING SOOTHED, SUCH AS BETWEEN KANYE WEST AND TAYLOR SWIFT. THAT IS TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT NO MATTER HOW ANGRY SOMEONE MIGHT BE AT ONE TIME, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET OVER IT AND MOVE BEYOND IT. THE RAGE CAN DIMINISH AND YOU CAN LET IT GO. WHO KNOWS' MAYBE AT NEXT YEAR'S AWARDS SHOW WE WILL SEE A DIFFERENT EXCHANGE BETWEEN NICKI AND MILEY.PLEASE TUNE IN TO THE DOCTOR ON CALL RADIO HOUR ON HEALTHYLIFE.NET EVERY TUESDAY AT 2 PM EST, 11 AM PST.

25	AT THE UNVEILING OF HIS TAX PLAN MONDAY, DONALD TRUMP DEPLOYED A THOROUGHLY DEBUNKED STATISTIC ABOUT THE AMERICAN JOBS MARKET. THE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, HE CLAIMED, IS SOMEWHERE NEAR 42 PERCENT. WHAT ABOUT THE THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SAID WAS 5.1 PERCENT FOR LAST MONTH ? THAT NUMBER, TRUMP SAID, IS THE BIGGEST JOKE THERE IS IN THIS COUNTRY. IN AUGUST, TRUMP MADE THE SAME STATEMENT TO TIME MAGAZINE . I SAW A CHART THE OTHER DAY, OUR REAL UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NINETY MILLION PEOPLE THAT ARENT WORKING. NINETY-THREE MILLION TO BE EXACT," HE SAID. WHATEVER CHART THAT WAS, TRUMP WAS READING ITWRONG. AND HES BEEN CALLED ON HIS ERROR REPEATEDLY . MY COLLEAGUE GLENN KESSLER WROTE A THOROUGH TAKEDOWN AT THE TIME, POINTING OUT THAT TRUMP WAS LUMPING TOGETHER RETIREES, STUDENTS, STAY-AT-HOME MOMS, AND ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARENT FIGURED INTO THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BECAUSE THEY ARENT AVAILABLE TO WORK. IT DOESNT SEEM THAT TRUMP WAS PAYING ATTENTION, SO WERE GOING TO TRY AGAIN WITH CHARTS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE LAST YEAR WAS, ON AVERAGE, 6.2 PERCENT, WHICH REFLECTS ABOUT 9.6 MILLION UNEMPLOYED OUT OF 156 MILLION IN THE CIVILIAN LABOR FORCE (PEOPLE READY AND ABLETO WORK, OR ACTIVELY LOOKING). TO BE OFFICIALLY UNEMPLOYED IN AMERICA, YOU HAVE TO HAVE LOOKED FOR WORK WITHIN THE PAST MONTH. NOW, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE STOPPED LOOKING FOR WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO DISCOURAGED BY THE CRAPPY ECONOMY. BUT MOST PEOPLE WHO AREN'T SEEKING EMPLOYMENT ARE BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS: LEARNING TO WALK, GOING TO SCHOOL, STAYING AT HOME TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN, TAKING A BREATHER FROM WORK, RETIRING TO THE GOOD LIFE. THIS CHART BREAKS IT DOWN: TRUMP MAY HAVE SEEN THAT 92 MILLIONFIGURE ON A CHART SOMEWHERE. AND ITS TRUE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARENT LOOKING FOR WORK. BUT THATS NOT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND WORK THEY WANT. AS NOTED ABOVE, MOST OF THEM HAVE A PRETTY GOOD REASON NOT TO WORK. OF THOSE 92 MILLION PEOPLE OVER 16 WHO WEREN'T LOOKING FOR WORK IN 2014, 86 MILLION (93 PERCENT) DID NOT WANT A JOB RIGHT THEN, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT SURVEYS. HERE ARE A FEW MORE DETAILS ON HOW THAT GROUP OF AMERICANS BREAKS DOWN: WITHOUT IDENTIFYING ANY ONE IN PARTICULAR, TRUMP SAID MONDAY THAT SOME GREAT ECONOMISTS HAVE PUT THE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 30 PERCENT, 32 PERCENT. HE THEN SAID THE NUMBER MIGHT EVEN BE 42 PERCENT, SAYING THAT'S "THE HIGHEST I'VE HEARD." THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO A 42 PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD BE TO COUNT EVERYONE'S GRANDMAS AND STAY-AT-HOME SPOUSES AS UNEMPLOYED. TO TAKE THIS KIND OF THINKING TO ITS LOGICAL EXTREME, CONSIDER THAT ONLY 146 MILLION OF AMERICA'S 319 MILLION WERE EMPLOYED IN 2014. MORE THAN HALF OF AMERICANS DID NOT HAVE JOBS (IN PART BECAUSE THEY WERE TEETHING). MAYBE THE REAL REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SHOULD BE54 PERCENT? OF COURSE NOT. BUT TRUMP IS CORRECT IN HIS SUSPICION THAT THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBER DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY. OF THE 92 MILLION AMERICANS WHO DIDN'T HAVE JOBS IN 2014, 6 MILLION WANTED A JOB BUT HADN'T BEEN LOOKING RECENTLY. THEY WEREN'T COUNTED IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, SINCE, WELL, THEY WEREN'T LOOKING. THE REASONS VARIED: SOME WENT BACK TOSCHOOL OR BECAME OCCUPIED WITH FAMILY MATTERS. SOME SIMPLY GAVE UP ON FINDING A JOB. THAT LAST CATEGORY DISCOURAGED WORKERS MAY BE WHAT TRUMP WAS REFERRING IN HIS SPEECH MONDAY. HE SAID, WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AND LOOK AND LOOK AND THEN THEY GIVE UP LOOKING FOR A JOB, THEY'RE TAKEN OFF THE ROLLS. THE SCALE OF THE DISCOURAGED-WORKER PROBLEM, THOUGH, IS MUCH SMALLER THAN TRUMP APPEARS TO BELIEVE. IN AUGUST, THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES THAT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 624,000 DISCOURAGED WORKERS FAR FROM 92 MILLION. THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS REPORTS AN ALTERNATIVE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT INCLUDES DISCOURAGED WORKERS. THAT NUMBER WAS 5.5 PERCENT IN AUGUST, COMPARED WITH THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH WAS 5.1. THERES ANOTHER , BROADER MEASURE OF UNEMPLOYMENT THAT THROWS IN THE MARGINALLY ATTACHED ANYONE WHO LOOKED FOR A JOB IN THE PAST YEAR, BUT NOT WITHIN THE PAST FOUR WEEKS. THERE WERE ABOUT 1.8 MILLION OF THOSE IN AUGUST. ADDING THEM TO THE MIX BUMPS UP THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO 6.2 PERCENT. FINALLY, THE MOST EXPANSIVE WAY THE GOVERNMENT MEASURES UNEMPLOYMENT ALSO FIGURES IN PART-TIME WORKERS WHO CANT FIND FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT. THERE WERE 6.3 MILLION OF THOSE IN AUGUST, AND THEY BRING THE RATE UP TO 10.3 PERCENT. ALL OF THESE NUMBERS PRESENT A USEFUL WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THOSE WHO WANT TO WORK IN AMERICA. THE NUMBER 42 PERCENT? THATS NOT THE ANSWER TO ANYTHING. JEFF GUO IS A STAFF WRITER FOR STORYLINE. HE'S FROM MARYLAND (BUT OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY). FOLLOW HIM ON TWITTER: @_JEFFGUO .
26	ONE OF THE FEW POSITIONAL UNITS THAT PLAYED WITH MIDSEASON POLISH DURING MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL S SLOPPY LATE GAME BETWEEN THE VIKINGS AND 49ERS WAS THE SAN FRANCISCOOFFENSIVE LINE THAT PAVED THE WAY FOR CARLOS HYDE S 168 YARD, TWO-TOUCHDOWN BREAKOUT PERFORMANCE. LIKE MOST GROUPS ON THE 49ERS ROSTER, THE OFFENSIVE LINE UNDERWENT A WORLD OF CHANGE THIS OFF-SEASON. AFTER A POOR PRESEASON, MANY QUESTIONED WHETHER THIS NEW-LOOK GROUP WOULD EVER COME CLOSE TO MATCHING THE DOMINANT OFFENSIVE LINES THE 49ERS FIELDED FOR SO MUCH OF THE PAST FOUR OR FIVE SEASONS. FOR ONE WEEK, ANYHOW, THEY DID. ONE OF THE FEW CONSTANTS OF THE 49ERS' OFFENSIVE LINE, AND THE ROSTER AS A WHOLE, IS LEFT TACKLE JOE STALEY , WHO IS AMONG THE LEAGUES BEST AT HIS POSITION. STALEY, A FIRST-ROUND PICK BY SAN FRANCISCO IN 2007, HAS BEEN NAMED TO THE PRO BOWL IN EACH OF THE PAST FOUR SEASONS. HES ALSO A STALWART IN THE LOCKER ROOM, KNOWN FOR HIS UNIQUE BRAND OF LEADERSHIP AND LEVITY. NFL WEEK 2 POWER RANKINGS | FARRAR: MARIOTA'S RAPID NFL TRANSITION I CHATTED WITH STALEY THIS WEEK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF HIS NEW STARTING RUNNING BACK, THE SPECIAL QUALITIES OF JIM TOMSULAAND WHAT HE REALLY THINKS ABOUT HIS TEAMS NEW BLACK UNIFORMS. MELISSA JACOBS: CARLOS HYDE LARGELY CREDITED YOU FOR HIS MONSTER GAME . HOW GOOD IS THIS KID? JOE STALEY: HES AWESOME. HE COULD BE ONE OF THE BEST IN THE NFL. HE HAS SO MUCH TALENT AND GREAT VISION AND WHAT WERE DOING SCHEMATICALLY REALLY FITS HIS STRENGTHS. HE SAID HE FELT LIKE HE WAS BACK OUT THERE AT OHIO STATE, AND WHAT HE DID THERE IS WHY WE DRAFTED HIM. YOU ALL GOT A GLIMPSE OF WHAT WE SAW THE WHOLE OFF-SEASON. IT WASNT TOO SURPRISING FOR US BUT FOR EVERYONE ELSE, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT. MJ: YOU MENTIONED SCHEMATICS. WHAT IN [OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR] GEEP CHRYSTS PLAYBOOK IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL, AND DO YOU FORESEE MORE OF A COMMITMENT TO THE GROUND GAME THIS YEAR? JS: EVERY GAME IS ITS OWN THING. ITS NOTHING WELL DO EVERY WEEK. BUT MONDAY WAS A REAL CREDIT TO OUR DEFENSE AND GAVE US THE PATIENCE TO STICK WITH OUR GAME PLAN, WHICH WAS REALLY TO ESTABLISH THE RUN. YOU SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE GET IN TROUBLE WITH THAT DEFENSIVE FRONT. WE WERE ABLE TO STICK WITH THE RUN AND THE TEMPO SO WE DEFINITELY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE. MJ: HOW DIFFICULT WAS THE OFF-SEASON IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH VIRTUALLY EVERY MEDIA MEMBER DECIDING YOU WOULD BE TERRIBLE AND MOCKING YOUR CHOICE OF A NEW HEAD COACH? JS: I HONESTLY DONT PAY MUCH ATTENTION. BUT THATS KIND OF EXPECTED. YOU HAVE A LOT OF TURNOVER, A NEW HEAD COACH. AUTOMATICALLY EVERYONE THINKS THE SKY IS FALLING. WHAT WE WORRY ABOUT AS A TEAM ARE THE PEOPLE HERE EVERY DAY PUTTING IN THE WORK AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE HERE AND WIN GAMES. THATS THE FOCUS. MJ: OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUR OLD COACH AND YOU NEW ONE, DIFFERENCES THAT PROBABLY SPAN SEVERAL CATEGORIES. TO YOU, WHATS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JIM HARBAUGH AND JIM TOMSULA? JS: THEY BOTH HAVE A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE, AND THEYRE BOTH GREAT HEAD COACHES. I DONT WANT TO GET INTO THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF EITHER, BUT IM PLAYING FOR COACH TOMSULA RIGHT NOW. HES DONE A GREAT JOB MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE FRESH GOING INTO WEEK 1. IF YOU LOOKED AT OUR INJURY REPORT GOING INTO WEEK 1 WE ONLY HAD ONE GUY LISTED, AND HE DRESSED AND PLAYED. THATS A TRIBUTE TO HOW COACH TOMSULA APPROACHED THE OFF-SEASON, TAKING CARE OF GUYS' BODIES AND MAKING SURE THEY GOT ENOUGH REPS TO WHERE THEY WERE READY BUT GOING INTO THE SEASON FRESH.TOMSULA DOES A GREAT JOB COMMUNICATING WITH THE GUYS AND LEANING ON THE VETERANS. HES REALLY RECEPTIVE TO THE VETERAN DUDES AND TAKES A LOT OF FEEDBACK, TOO, WHICH IS NICE. NOT TO SAY THAT HARBAUGH DIDNT DO THAT ALL, BECAUSE HE DID, BUT ITS ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF JIMMY. HES A PLAYERS GUY AND HAS A LOT OF GUYS HE TRUSTS. BUT YOU HAVE TO EARN THAT TRUST. MJ: LEADING INTO THE PRESEASON THEMMQB RAN A GREAT, IN-DEPTH TOMSULA STORY THAT COVERED A LOT OF BASES. STILL, TELL US ONE THING ABOUT JIMMY T WE DONT ALREADY KNOW. JS: HIS FIRST YEAR WAS MY FIRST YEAR. HE WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST LOVED COACHES FOR THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS HERE. HE ALREADY HAS THAT RESPECT, THE ADMIRATION. HES ONE OF THE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE GUYS, ONE OF THE MOST PASSIONATE AND HE DOESNT THINK ABOUT FOOTBALL THE WAY A TYPICAL COACH DOES. HE THINKS ABOUT IT MORE AS A PLAYER. HE UNDERSTANDS THE PASSION AND EMOTION. AND HE UNDERSTANDS THE MENTAL ASPECT. MJ : IN JULY, YOU MADE AN EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE JOE SHOW , THE INTERNET SMASH WHERE YOU ASK TEAMMATES STUPID QUESTIONS IS RETURNING AFTER A TWO-YEAR HIATUS. JS: MAYBE. MJ: MAYBE? JS: I HAD TOYED WITH IT COMING BACK BUT I MAY KEEP IT ON THE SHELF FOR A WHILE. CONSIDER THIS A TEASER. I WANT TO KEEP EVERYONE ON THEIR TOES. MJ: BE HONEST. ARE YOU SHELVING YOUR SHOW BECAUSE JARRYD HAYNE IS SUCH A HARD GET THESE DAYS? JS: IM PRETTY SURE IF I HAD MY SHOW I COULD GET JARRYD. [LAUGHS.] MJ: DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO CHECK OUT THE GUARDIANS LIVE BLOG OF YOUR GAME? JS: I DID AND IT WAS HILARIOUS. I LOVED HOW HE DIDNT UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE SO MANY COMMERCIALS. MJ: OK, JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK-HIT QUESTIONS. WHO ARE THE TOP THREE LEFT TACKLES IN THE NFL? JS: JOE THOMAS AND JASON PETERS ARE THE TWO GUYS WHO REALLY COME TO MIND. ID LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS ONE OF THE TOP BUT I ALSO THINK THATS KIND OF VAIN TO TALK ABOUT YOURSELF THAT WAY. I REALLY ADMIRE THOSE GUYS AND ONE OF THE YOUNG GUYS THINK WILL BE GOOD FOR A REALLY LONG TIME IS TAYLOR LEWAN , THE LEFT TACKLE FOR THE TITANS . I LOVE WATCHING HIM ON FILM. MJ: IF YOU WERE NFL COMMISSIONER FOR A DAY, WHATS YOUR FIRST CHANGE? JS: I WOULD HIRE AN OUTSIDE DISCIPLINARY COUNCIL. MJ: ON A SCALE OF 110, HOW MUCH DO YOU MISS CANDLESTICK PARK? JS: THATS A LOADED QUESTION. ILL PASS ON THAT ONE. [LAUGHS.] MJ: THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO ANSWER MY LAST QUESTION, WHICH IS HOW WOULD YOU RANK YOUR ALTERNATIVE BLACK UNIFORMS ON A SCALE OF HIDEOUS TO RIDICULOUSLY HIDEOUS? JS: I LOVED THEM. I THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT. I DONT KNOW WHY EVERYONE WAS HATING ON THEM.

27	DR. HUXTABLE TO THE ER, STAT! WE'VE GOT A CLASSIC CASE OF BLOCKED POLICIES ON OUR HANDS! BY NOW, MANY OF US ASSUMED THAT THE DISTURBING SEXUAL ABUSE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST COMEDIAN BILL COSBY -- WHO PLAYED DR. HEATHCLIFF "CLIFF" HUXTABLE ON TV'S LONG-RUNNING SITCOM, "THE COSBY SHOW" -- WOULD EVENTUALLY BE PLAYED OUT IN A COURT OF LAW. WE DIDN'T EXPECT THIS SCANDAL TO TAKE A DETOUR THROUGH INSURANCE COURT, MUCH LESS INVOLVE A HOME INSURANCE POLICY. COSBY WANTS AIG'S SUIT TOSSED OR DELAYED LAST WEEK, THE 78-YEAR-OLD ACTOR, WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY AT LEAST 40 WOMEN OF HAVING DRUGGED AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THEM OVER SEVERAL DECADES, ASKED A FEDERAL JUDGE IN SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, TO DISMISS OR PUT ON HOLD A LAWSUIT FILED BY HIS HOME INSURER, AIG. IN JUNE, AIG SUED COSBY IN CALIFORNIA AND MASSACHUSETTS OVER HOME INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO HIM IN THOSE STATES. THE INSURER MAINTAINS THE POLICIES IN QUESTION COVER PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, WHICH INCLUDE DEFAMATION, EXCEPT WHEN THOSE CLAIMS ARISE FROM "SEXUAL, PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ABUSE." DEFAMATION LAWSUITS HAVE ALREADY BEEN FILED AGAINST COSBY BY TAMARA GREEN, THERESE SERIGNESE AND LINDA TRAITZ IN MASSACHUSETTS, AND BY MODEL JANICE DICKINSON IN CALIFORNIA. THE WOMEN CLAIM THEY WERE DEFAMED BY THE DENIALS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY COSBY OR HIS REPRESENTATIVES. RISK OF 'SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE' SEEN COSBY'S COUNSEL MAINTAINS THE ACTOR WOULD FACE "SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE" IF HE WERE TO HAVE TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THE WOMEN'S LAWSUITS AND AIG'S POLICY ACTION SIMULTANEOUSLY. "FORCING MR. COSBY TO FIGHT A FOUR-FRONT BATTLE WOULD DEMONSTRATE AIG'S COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF MR. COSBY," HIS LAWYERS WROTE IN A COURT FILING. "NOT ONLY DOES AIG'S ACTION BOLSTER THE UNDERLYING PLAINTIFFS, WHO WILL PERCEIVE MR. COSBY AS UNDER ATTACK EVEN FROM HIS SUPPOSED BACKERS, BUT IT SPLITS MR. COSBY'S FOCUS AND DRAINS HIS RESOURCES." AN AIG SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT, WHEN ASKED BY REUTERS. THE INSURANCE COMPANY NAMED THE 4 WOMEN AS CODEFENDANTS IN ITS ACTION, STATING THAT IT WAS SEEKING RELIEF THAT COULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THEIR DEFAMATION SUITS. THOUGH FEW OF US TAKE NOTE OF IT, DEFAMATION AND LIABILITY RISK IS GROWING WITH THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, TO THE POINT WHERE SOME INSURERS ADVOCATE SPECIAL COVERAGE FOR BLOGGERS .

28	LET ME SAY FIRST OFF: NOBODY KNOWS WHETHER WYOMINGS PLAN TO CONSERVE SAGE GROUSE IS GOING TO WORK. IF SOMEBODY DOES CLAIM TO KNOW WITH CERTAINTY, THEN YOU HAVE GOOD REASON TO BE SKEPTICAL. THATS BECAUSE SAGE GROUSE CONSERVATION IS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM WITHIN AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX NATURAL SYSTEM. WYOMINGS UPDATED PLAN, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE SPECIES MOST IMPORTANT HABITATS -- THEIR CORE AREAS -- MIGHT BE THE BIRDS BEST BET. BUT LIKE ANY PLAN, THE SUCCESS OF WYOMINGS CONSERVATION STRATEGY, AND SIMILAR STRATEGIES IN OTHER WESTERN STATES, WILL ULTIMATELY COME DOWN TO HOW WELL THE PLANS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY WE CAN ADAPT TO NEW INFORMATION AND EMERGING SCIENCE. WHATS NOTABLE IS THAT THIS EFFORT MIGHT WELL BE A MODEL FOR A NEW KIND OF APPROACH: A HOMEGROWN, STAKEHOLDER-INCLUSIVE, COLLABORATIVE MEANS TO CONSERVATION WHERE IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. RANCHERS, BIOLOGISTS, INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES, CONSERVATIONISTS, AGENCY AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND OTHERS ARE INVOLVED IN CRAFTING THE PLAN AND THUS HAVE STRONG BUY-IN FOR ASSURING ITS IMPLEMENTATION. FOR READERS WHO DONT KNOW, WYOMINGS PLAN IS THE PRODUCT OF AN UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATIVE EFFORT IN RECENT YEARS TO CONSERVE THE GREATER SAGE-GROUSE, WHICH IS ONE OF WYOMINGS AND THE WESTS MOST ICONIC, BEAUTIFUL -- AND IMPERILED -- SPECIES. GOVS. DAVE FREUDENTHAL AND MATT MEAD BOTH UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS AT STAKE: IF THE SAGE GROUSE WERE LISTED AS A THREATENED OR ENDANGERED SPECIES, ENERGY EXTRACTION AND OTHER TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT WOULD LIKELY BE CURTAILED THROUGHOUT THE BIRDS RANGE, AND NOT ONLY IN CORE HABITAT AREAS. IN A STATE THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON REVENUES FROM MINERAL EXTRACTION, SUCH A POSSIBILITY GETS FOLKS ATTENTION. IF WYOMING HADNT STEPPED UP WHEN IT DID, ITS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROTECTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN BOTH NECESSARY AND UNAVOIDABLE. SOMETIMES JUST THE THREAT OF THIS KIND OF FEDERAL ACTION CAN BE THE IMPETUS FOR BETTER WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES. OUR GOVERNORS APPROACH HAS BEEN TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE IN WYOMING, WHERE AN ESTIMATED 40 PERCENT OF THE REMAINING SAGE-GROUSE LIVE. FREUDENTHAL LED THE EFFORT TO CREATE WHAT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE STATES CORE AREA STRATEGY. MEAD HAS FURTHERED THAT EFFORT, REFINING THIS STRATEGY TWICE ALREADY, AS NEW INFORMATION AND NEW SCIENCE HAS EMERGED. THEY EMPOWERED A BROAD GROUP OF CITIZENS, EXPERTS AND SCIENTISTS TO WORK ON THE PROBLEM YEAR AFTER YEAR, DRAWING UPON UPON LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND STAKEHOLDER EXPERTISE, WITH THE COMMON GOAL OF MAKING SURE MEASURES ARE TAKEN SO THAT AN ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING DECISION IS NOT NECESSARY. THAT GOAL HAS BEEN, AND REMAINS, A TALL ORDER. SAGE GROUSE AND SAGE GROUSE HABITAT ARE IN TROUBLE. THE SPECIES HAS BEEN IN STEADY DECLINE FOR A LONG TIME NOW, AND ITS ESTIMATED THAT TODAY THERE ARE ABOUT 80 PERCENT TO 90 PERCENT FEWER SAGE GROUSE RANGE-WIDE THAN THERE WERE 150-200 YEARS AGO. WYOMINGS ACTIONS WILL LIKELY PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DETERMINING WHETHER OVERALL SAGE GROUSE POPULATIONS BEGIN TO STABILIZE OR CONTINUE TO DECLINE. MY OPINION: THE STATES PLAN CAN WORK IF ITS FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED. AND WHILE I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE, I ALSO KNOW THAT A GOOD PLAN CAN JUST AS QUICKLY BECOME AN EMPTY PROMISE IF COMMITMENT WAVERS. WYOMING WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN FOR DECADES, LONG AFTER THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE MAKES ITS LISTING DECISION THIS MONTH. STATE REGULATORS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL BE FACED WITH TOUGH DECISIONS AND BEFORE LONG THEY WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ALLOWING DEVELOPMENT OR PROTECTING IMPORTANT HABITAT -- THAT WILL BE THE TEST. AND YEARS FROM NOW I HOPE THIS ADMINISTRATIONS LEGACY IS NOT THAT IT KEPT THE BIRD OFF THE LIST IN 2015 BUT THAT IT KEPT IT FROM EXTINCTION. CRAFTING THE PLAN WAS THE EASY PART. LIVING UP TO ITS PROMISE? NOW THAT WILL TAKE SOME WORK.
