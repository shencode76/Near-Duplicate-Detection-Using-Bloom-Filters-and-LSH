1	ARCHIVE: FIRST DEMONSTRATION OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE VIEW 0 COMMENTS EMERGING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE ARXIV SEPTEMBER 10, 2015 FIRST DEMONSTRATION OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE NEXT TIME YOU NEED TO CHOOSE, WHY NOT LET A PHOTON MAKE THE DECISION INSTEAD? IMAGINE WALKING INTO A CASINO TO PLAY THE ONE-ARMED BANDITS.YOUVE HEARD THAT ONE OF THEM PAYS OUT MORE THAN THE OTHERS, SO YOUR GOAL IS TO FIND OUT WHICH. BUT HOW MUCH OF YOUR RESOURCES SHOULD YOU POUR INTO EXPLORING THE MACHINES BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO EXPLOIT ONE OF THEM? THIS PROBLEM IS KNOWN AS THE EXPLORATION-EXPLOITATION DILEMMA, AND IT CROPS UP IN ALL KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES, FROM OIL EXPLORATION TO GAMBLING TO BUSINESS PLANNING. THE DIFFICULTY, OF COURSE, IS THAT THE MACHINES ARE PROBABILISTIC, SO IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO BE TRICKED INTO PLAYING A POORLY PAYING MACHINE BY A GOOD RUN THAT OCCURS BY CHANCE. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF ALGORITHMS THAT CAN HELP. THESE ARE COMPUTER PROGRAMS OF VARYING DEGREES OF COMPLEXITY THAT SIMULATE WHAT IS GOING ON AND USE PROBABILITY THEORY TO CALCULATE THE BEST NEXT MOVE. BUT NOW THERE IS ANOTHER WAY.  I GET IT, SHES TRYING TO EAT FATTY FOODS TO GAIN WEIGHT, BUT MAN, POEHLER IS FUNNY; JUST GET OUT OF HER WAY AND LET HER BE FUNNY! TODAY, MAKOTO NARUSE AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY IN TOKYO, JAPAN, AND PALS POINT OUT THAT THE LAWS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS ARE PROBABILISTIC, AND SO PROVIDE A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT FOR DECISION THEORY. AND THATS ALLOWED THEM TO BUILD AN EXTRAORDINARY DECISION-MAKING DEVICE. THEIR NEW TOY IS A PHOTON GUN AND A SINGLE PHOTON DETECTOR THAT USES THE LAWS OF PHYSICS TO MAKE DECISIONS, RATHER THAN COMPLEX ALGORITHMS. THE DEVICE RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS KIND OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE COULD HELP MAKE COMPLEX DECISIONS.  WHICH MANNING SHOWS UP SUNDAY IS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE. THE THEORY IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. ONE STRATEGY TO FIND THE BEST PAYING ONE-ARMED BANDIT IS TO START FEEDING THE MACHINES AND COUNT HOW MUCH THEY PAY OUT EACH TIME. THEN, AS YOU LEARN, FEED MORE INTO THE MACHINES THAT PAY BETTER UNTIL YOU FIND THE BEST. THE SINGLE PHOTON DECISION MAKER DOES ALL THIS AUTOMATICALLY.  NAURU OFFICIALS DENY ALLEGATIONS GREENS SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG HAS ALSO BEEN LOOKING INTO THE FAMILY'S STORY. IT CONSISTS OF A GUN THAT FIRES PHOTONS THROUGH A POLARIZING FILTER. THIS FILTER CAN BE ADJUSTED TO POLARIZE THE PHOTONS HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY. WHEN IT IS AT 45 DEGREES, HOWEVER, EACH PHOTON HAS AN EQUAL CHANCE OF BEING HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY POLARIZED. SO THIS SET UP PRODUCES A STEADY STREAM OF PHOTONS POLARIZED EITHER HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY WITH A 50 PERCENT CHANCE OF EACH. ROTATING THE FILTER CHANGES THESE ODDS. MOVING THE FILTER TOWARD THE VERTICAL INCREASES THE CHANCES OF VERTICAL POLARIZATION WHILE REDUCING THE CHANCES OF HORIZONTAL POLARIZATION. SO IN THIS SETUP, MORE PHOTONS WILL BE VERTICALLY POLARIZED. NEXT, NARUSE AND CO USE THE POLARIZATION OF THE PHOTONS TO CHOOSE WHICH OF TWO SLOT MACHINES TO PLAY. FOR EXAMPLE, A VERTICAL PHOTON MEANS A PLAY ON THE FIRST BANDIT WHILE A HORIZONTAL PHOTON MEANS A PLAY ON THE SECOND BANDIT. THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS COMES BY CREATING A FEEDBACK LOOP THAT CHANGES THE ORIENTATION OF THE POLARIZING FILTER AFTER EACH PLAY. SO IF THE FIRST BANDIT PAYS OUT, THE FILTER MOVES TO THE VERTICAL MAKING IT MORE LIKELY TO BE PLAYED IN FUTURE. BUT IF A HORIZONTAL PHOTON TRIGGERS A PAYOUT, THE FILTER MOVES TO THE HORIZONTAL.  WHATS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS SETUP IS THAT IT REQUIRES NO STANDARD COMPUTING, NO SIMULATION OF THE SYSTEM, AND NO NUMBER CRUNCHING OF PROBABILITIES. INSTEAD, THE LAWS OF PHYSICS MAKE THE DECISION VIA A SIMPLE FEEDBACK MECHANISM.  SUPPORT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES AND MEDICINES FOR THECOMMUNICABLE AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES THAT PRIMARILY AFFECT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, PROVIDE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE ESSENTIAL MEDICINESAND VACCINES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOHA DECLARATION WHICH AFFIRMS THE RIGHT OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO USE TO THE FULL THE PROVISIONS INTHE TRIPS AGREEMENT REGARDING FLEXIBILITIES TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTHAND, IN PARTICULAR, PROVIDE ACCESS TO MEDICINES FOR ALL 4.1. THIS IS NOT JUST THEORETICAL WORK. NARUSE AND CO HAVE BUILT THEIR OWN PHOTON DECISION-MAKER USING A PHOTON GUN MADE FROM A NITROGEN VACANCY INNANODIAMAOND. THE PHOTONS FROM THIS DEVICE DETERMINE WHICH OF TWO SLOT MACHINES TO PLAY WITH THE RESULTS FED BACK TO CHANGE THE ORIENTATION OF A POLARIZATION FILTER. THE RESULTS ARE IMPRESSIVE. THE SINGLE PHOTON DECISION-MAKER QUICKLY FINDS THE BEST PAYING BANDIT AND EVEN CHANGES ITS MIND WHEN NARUSE AND CO CHANGE THE PAYOUT ODDS OF THE MACHINES. WE EXPERIMENTALLY DEMONSTRATE ACCURATE AND ADAPTIVE DECISION MAKING, THEY SAY. THATS INTERESTING WORK THAT HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR INTELLIGENT MACHINES. ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS NEW MACHINE IS ITS SIMPLICITYIT REQUIRES NO STANDARD COMPUTING MACHINERY AT ALL. IT CAN ALSO BE TINY, OPERATING ON A SCALE OF NANOMETERS WHILE USING VERY LITTLE POWER. BUT IT IS CONCEPTUALLY WHERE THE NEW DEVICE MIGHT HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT. THERE IS A CLEAR FEELING THAT INTELLIGENT MACHINES MUST RELY ON ELECTRONIC COMPUTATION TO MAKE DECISIONS. NARUSE AND CO SHOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  DURING THE LIVE BROADCAST ON SUNDAY, NICKI CALLED MILEY A "BITCH" FOR TALKING ABOUT HER IN THE PRESS. INSTEAD, A NEW KIND OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE USES THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AND CLEVER DESIGN SEEM TO DECIDE FOR ITSELF.  INSTEAD, WE HAVE TO USE A SPECIAL TYPE OF MICROSCOPE." THIS MICROSCOPE - A SCATTERING-TYPE SCANNING NEAR-FIELD INFRARED MICROSCOPE - IS CAPABLE OF SEEING DETAILS 1000 TIMES SMALLER THAN A STANDARD INFRARED MICROSCOPE, VISUALIZING "OBJECTS" OF JUST 10 NANOMETERS.

5	JEPKEMOI LAUNCHED AN INNOVATIVE MARKETING AND PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM IN 2009. SHE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO CLIENT NEEDS AND QUICKLY GAINED A SOLID FOOTHOLD IN THE NAIROBI, AND LATER MOMBASA, MARKET. HER TOP LINE REVENUES TRIPLED EACH YEAR BETWEEN 2010 AND 2012 AND DOUBLED AFTERWARDS UNTIL SALES TOOK A NOSEDIVE IN 2014.  WEDNESDAY AT ELINE FUNERAL HOME, 934 S. HALFWAY THROUGH 2015, JEPKEMOI DECIDED TO SEND OUT ONLINE SURVEYS TO HER EXISTING, FORMER AND PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS. MUCH TO HER DISMAY, QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS INDICATED A MARKET PERCEPTION THAT HER FIRMS ONCE COVETED CREATIVITY HAD DISSIPATED AND WOULD-BE CLIENTS VIEWED THE COMPANY AS DECIDEDLY NOT INNOVATIVE. PUZZLED, JEPKEMOI ATTEMPTED TO THINK THROUGH WHAT UNDERPINNED THE DISMAL FEEDBACK. INITIALLY TEMPTED TO BLAME INCREASED COMPETITION, SHE DECIDED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. THE ONLY MAJOR CHANGE IN HER BUSINESS INVOLVED HIRING OF A NEW CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER (CMO) IN FEBRUARY 2014. HOWEVER, JEPKEMOI THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY THAT THE CMO CHANGE COULD HAVE LED TO THE DEMISE OF THE FIRMS INNOVATION. SHE VIEWED THE CMO AS A GO-GETTER, ORGANISED AND MUCH IN CONTROL OF ALL EXTERNAL ASPECTS OF THE MARKETING AND PUBLIC RELATIONS BUSINESS. JEPKEMOI DECIDED TO SET UP A BREAKFAST MEETING WITH A FORMER MBA COLLEAGUE WHO ALWAYS SEEMED TO KNOW STRATEGY AND ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENT MATTERS. BETWEEN SIPS OF COFFEE, HER FRIEND EXPLAINED THE DELICATE BALANCE OF MAINTAINING CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION IN A COMPANY. SHE RECOMMENDED THAT JEPKEMOI USE AN INTERNAL SURVEY OF HER STAFF TO GAUGE THEIR CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS TOWARDS INNOVATION. THE FRIEND POINTED OUT HOW RESEARCHERS LIKE SCOTT HELM AND FREDRIK ANDERSSON EMPLVOY THE INNOVATION TOOL IN SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS BUSINESSES LIKE HERS. EAGER TO DIAGNOSE ANY ISSUES AND SAVE HER FIRM, JEPKEMOI QUICKLY DOWNLOADED THE SURVEY TOOL AND OBTAINED RESPONSES FROM HER ENTIRE TEAM.  JEPKEMOI, LIKE MOST EXECUTIVES, DID NOT GRASP THE ROOT AINTERNAL ANTECEDENTS THAT FOSTER EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION. RESEARCH BY ROBERT DEVELLIS SHOWS THAT MANAGERS CAN PREDICT FUTURE INNOVATION SUCCESS BY THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEIR EMPLOYEES PERCEIVE THE FOLLOWING THREE CREATIVE DRIVERS: PROACTIVENESS, RISK TAKING AND INNOVATION ORIENTATION. EXECUTIVES MUST FOSTER THESE THREE CAUSES OF INNOVATION TO BENEFIT FROM GREATER CREATIVITY. FIRST, DO EMPLOYEES FEEL THAT PROACTIVENESS IS VALUED OR FROWNED UPON? MOST EXECUTIVES PREFER PROACTIVE EMPLOYEES. HOWEVER, THE RIGIDITY, JEALOUSY AND COMPETITIVE NATURE WITHIN OFFICES OFTEN OVERRULES THE EXECUTIVES DESIRE FOR A PROACTIVE WORKFORCE. SO ONE MUST EXAMINE HOW EMPLOYEES TRULY FEEL.  IM SURE OFFENSIVELY I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF GUYS THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO PLAY BETTER. FURTHER, THE EXECUTIVE MUST LOOK AT HIS OR HER PAST PERFORMANCE WITH REGARDS TO PROACTIVENESS. IS YOUR FIRM SELDOM OR OFTEN THE FIRST ORGANISATION TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES, ADMINISTRATIVE TECHNIQUES OR OPERATING PROCESSES? DOES YOUR COMPANY EXPLOIT OR LAG CHANGES IN THE FIELD? ALSO, DO YOU PROVIDE THE LEAD FOR SIMILAR SERVICE PROVIDERS OR YOU FOLLOW OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS? THE TOUGH INTROSPECTIVE QUESTIONS CONTINUE WHEN ASSESSING YOUR EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISATIONS TOLERANCE AND HISTORY OF RISK TAKING. IF YOU HARSHLY PUNISH ERRANT OUTCOMES DESPITE CAREFUL PRE-PLANNING, THEN YOU SQUASH RISK TAKING. EMPLOYEES WHO FEEL EXPOSED TO CASTIGATION FOR TAKING CHANCES BECOME DRASTICALLY LESS CREATIVE IN THEIR WORKPLACE. ADDITIONALLY, DOES YOUR COMPANY SPECIFICALLY CONDUCT ITSELF IN LINE WITH THE BEHAVIOURAL NORMS OF YOUR INDUSTRY OR DO YOU BREAK OUTSIDE THE BOX OF NORMAL WORKPLACE REPORTING TIMES, MANNERS OF DRESS, EMPLOYEE TEAM REPORTING OR STAFF REWARDS? DO YOU STAY IN SAFE TERRITORY BY ACQUIRING NEW PROJECTS THAT FIT WITH YOUR PUBLIC IMAGE OR ALLOW YOUR FIRM TO TAKE ON NEW PROJECTS THAT WILL ALTER ITS PUBLIC IMAGE? NEXT, DO YOUR DECISIONS MAINTAIN OR CREATE CHANGES IN STAFF STABILITY? THE ANSWER TO THESE QUESTIONS POINT TO THE AMOUNT OF ORGANISATIONAL RISK YOU TAKE. FINALLY, LOOK INTO INNOVATION ORIENTATION ITSELF. DO YOU REWARD NEW WAYS OF ACCOMPLISHING TASKS? DO YOU HOLD INTERNAL COMPETITIONS FOR THE MOST CREATIVE SOLUTIONS? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HELD AN INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY WORKSHOP FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES? ORGANISATIONAGLLY, DOES YOUR FIRM RETAIN A HISTORY OF STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR MAINTAIN TRIED-AND-TRUE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES? CAN YOUR FIRM BOAST A RECORD OF SOLID DEVELOPMENT OF NEW INTERNAL PROCESSES OR THE USE OF ESTABLISHED METHODS? HAVE YOU INTRODUCED MULTIPLE NEW PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND POLICIES IN THE PAST OR INTRODUCED FEW OR NONE? WERE MOST MODIFICATIONS IN INTERNAL PROCESSES, SERVICES, PRODUCTS AND POLICIES MAJOR CHANGES OR MINOR CHANGES? THESE WILL REVEAL YOUR APTITUDE FOR COMPANY-WIDE CREATIVITY. IN SUMMARY, JEPKEMOI MUST REMOVE OR COACH HER CMO TO FOSTER PROACTIVENESS, RISK TAKING AND INNOVATION ORIENTATION IN ORDER TO REAP THE PROFITABLE REWARDS THAT GREATER INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY BRINGS TO AN ORGANISATION. HOW DOES YOUR COMPANY FALL WITHIN THE ABOVE MEASURES? SHARE YOUR IDEAS ON HOW TO FOSTER THE ANTECEDENTS OF INNOVATION IN YOUR FIRM WITH OTHER BUSINESS DAILY READERS THROUGH #INNOVATIONFORUM ON TWITTER.

7	NORTH CARROLL HIGH SCHOOL HONORED ED POWELSON SIX YEARS AGO BY NAMING ITS STADIUM FIELD AFTER THE MAN WHO DEVOTED ALMOST ALL OF HIS ADULT LIFE TO HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS IN HAMPSTEAD, AND SEVERAL COUNTY SPORTS FIGURES ATTENDED THE CEREMONY. ONE OF THEM WAS GEORGE WUNDER, A 1992 NORTH CARROLL GRAD AND LONGTIME BASKETBALL COACH AT CENTURY HIGH. HE WANTED THE PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE TO KNOW HOW MUCH POWELSON IMPACTED HIS LIFE, AND MANY OTHERS, AS A COACH, ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, AND ROLE MODEL. "NO ONE EVER CARED ABOUT NORTH CARROLL MORE," WUNDER SAID THAT DAY, "THAN MR. POWELSON." LRELATED WESTMINSTERASCENSION EPISCOPAL CHURCH HOLDS BLESSING OF THE ANIMALSSEE ALL RELATED 8 POWELSON, ONE OF CARROLL COUNTY'S MORE RECOGNIZABLE SPORTS FIGURES, DIED SUNDAY AFTER A LONG BATTLE WITH CANCER. HE WAS 77. POWELSON COACHED BOYS SOCCER AT NORTH CARROLL FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS AND FINISHED HIS COACHING CAREER WITH 274 WINS THE MOST IN STATE HISTORY FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL COACH WHEN HE RETIRED IN 1995 TO GO WITH 46 COMBINED COUNTY, CONFERENCE AND REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS. HE WAS INDUCTED INTO THE CARROLL COUNTY SPORTS HALL OF FAME IN 2001, AND LATER THIS WEEK NORTH CARROLL WILL BEGIN ITS SEVENTH FALL SPORTS SEASON WITH GAMES PLAYED ON POWELSON FIELD. CCOMMENTS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY? START THE CONVERSATION AND BE THE FIRST TO COMMENT. ADD A COMMENT 0 TROY WAREHIME, NORTH CARROLL'S ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, SPOKE DURING A CEREMONY IN 2006 WHEN POWELSON BECAME THE FIRST MEMBER OF NC'S SPORTS HALL OF FAME. THREE YEARS LATER, HE SPOKE AGAIN AT THE POWELSON FIELD DEDICATION CEREMONY. WAREHIME IS PLANNING TO SAY SOME WORDS ABOUT POWELSON LATER THIS WEEK AT ONE OF POWELSON'S MEMORIAL SERVICES. "THIS TIME WON'T BE SO EASY," WAREHIME SAID. "HE WAS MY HERO." POWELSON HAILED FROM RIDGELEY, WEST VIRGINIA, GRADUATED FROM FAIRMONT STATE COLLEGE IN 1959, AND CAME TO CARROLL COUNTY IN 1961, WHEN HE TOOK A JOB TEACHING PHYSICAL EDUCATION AT HAMPSTEAD ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS. HE DECLINED AN OFFER TO BECOME A PE TEACHER AT NORTH CARROLL HIGH THE FOLLOWING YEAR. WHEN IT WAS OFFERED AGAIN THE NEXT YEAR, HE ACCEPTED. "I FIGURED THEY WOULDN'T ASK THREE TIMES," POWELSON SAID IN A 1997 TIMES ARTICLE. POWELSON COACHED TRACK AND FIELD, BASKETBALL, AND SOCCER TO START, THEN ADDED GYMNASTICS TO HIS RESUME. HE ALSO INHERITED ATHLETIC DIRECTOR DUTIES, EVEN THOUGH SUCH A POSITION DIDN'T REALLY EXIST BACK THEN. "I WAS THE ONLY COACH," POWELSON SAID IN THE 1997 ARTICLE. "AND YOU DID ALL THE SCHEDULING, YOU DID EVERYTHING, EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T CALLED ATHLETIC DIRECTORS AND WE DIDN'T GET PAID A CENT FOR ANY OF IT, WHICH WAS FINE. "THAT WASN'T A PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT WASN'T WHY YOU GET IN TEACHING OR COACHING. YOU WERE IN IT FOR THE LOVE OF IT." POWELSON'S BOYS SOCCER TEAMS WON 20 COUNTY TITLES BETWEEN 1961 AND 1988 AND ENJOYED A 46-GAME WINNING STREAK. HE STEPPED AWAY FROM COACHING IN 1995, AND LEFT HIS POST AS ATHLETIC DIRECTOR IN 1997, WRAPPING UP A TEACHING AND COACHING CAREER THAT SPANNED FOUR DECADES. "HE TAUGHT KIDS, HE TAUGHT THEIR PARENTS, AND HE MIGHT HAVE TAUGHT A FEW OF THEIR GRANDPARENTS," WAREHIME SAID. POWELSON HELPED INTRODUCE THE ATHLETIC TRAINER PROGRAM TO CARROLL IN THE 1980S; HE HELPED FORM THE MONOCACY VALLEY ATHLETIC LEAGUE IN 1972 AND THE CENTRAL MARYLAND CONFERENCE IN THE '80S; AND HE WAS INDUCTED INTO THE MARYLAND STATE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR HALL OF FAME IN 1998. "THEY SORT OF BROKE THE MOLD WITH ED," SAID JIM RODRIGUEZ, CARROLL'S SUPERVISOR OF ATHLETICS, AT THE 2009 FIELD-NAMING CEREMONY. "IT'S ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE HE TOUCHED AND THE LIFE LESSONS HE GAVE THEM BEYOND THE FIELD." WHEN NORTH CARROLL'S FOOTBALL TEAM HAD THE FIRST HOME PLAYOFF CONTEST IN ITS HISTORY LAST FALL, POWELSON WAS ON HAND TO TAKE PART IN THE PRE-GAME COIN FLIP. HE WAS ALREADY INTO HIS FIGHT AGAINST PROSTATE CANCER AT THE TIME, BUT POWELSON RARELY MISSED A SPORTING EVENT AT EITHER NORTH CARROLL OR MANCHESTER VALLEY. HIS DAUGHTER, DENEAN KOONTZ, IS NORTH CARROLL'S FIELD HOCKEY COACH. HIS SON-IN-LAW, BERNIE KOONTZ, COACHES BASKETBALL AT MANCHESTER VALLEY. DENEAN KOONTZ SAID IT SERVED HER FATHER WELL DURING A DIFFICULT TIME BEING ABLE TO WATCH THE PANTHERS' FIELD HOCKEY TEAM WIN THE LAST TWO CLASS 1A STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS, WITH HIS GRANDDAUGHTER JENSYN KOONTZ AS A STANDOUT. "HE DOESN'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY," DENEAN KOONTZ SAID. "HE KEPT FIGHTING UNTIL THE DAY HE PASSED AWAY. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO MY FATHER ... WAS HIS FAMILY. FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THE PAST [FEW] YEARS WITH THEM, AND TO SEE ALL OF THOSE THINGS, WAS VERY, VERY SPECIAL."

8	LONDON: TROUBLESOME CHELSEA STRIKER DIEGO COSTA WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A PETTY CRIMINAL RATHER THAN A MASTER VILLAIN IN THE 1950S AND 1960S, ACCORDING TO BRAZIL GREAT PELE. COSTA, WHO WAS BORN IN BRAZIL BUT OPTED TO REPRESENT SPAIN AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, HAS BEEN BANNED FOR THREE GAMES FOR TWICE HITTING LAURENT KOSCIELNY DURING CHELSEA'S 2-0 DEFEAT OF ARSENAL LAST WEEKEND. IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE SNARLING CENTRE-FORWARD HAS FALLEN FOUL OF THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES, BUT PELE, FAMOUSLY KICKED OUT OF THE 1966 WORLD CUP BY PORTUGAL'S JOAO MORAIS, SAID COSTA'S CRIMES WERE NOTHING COMPARED TO THE PUNISHMENTS METED OUT TO HIM DURING HIS EXTRAORDINARY CAREER. "LISTEN, THIS TO ME WAS SO COMMON," A SMILING PELE TOLD AFP. "I SUFFERED ALL MY LIFE WITH GOOD MARKING. HE'S A VERY GOOD PLAYER, EVERYBODY KNOWS. "THIS WAS ONE MOMENT. THE STRIKER WHO BIT SOMEONE, LUIS SUAREZ, WAS WORSE THAN THIS." PELE, A LEADING CONTENDER FOR THE TITLE OF GREATEST FOOTBALLER OF ALL-TIME, WAS SPEAKING AT THE LAUNCH OF AN EXHIBITION TO MARK HIS 75TH BIRTHDAY, WHICH FALLS ON OCTOBER 23. CALLED 'ART, LIFE, FOOTBALL', THE EXHIBITION AT LONDON'S HALCYON GALLERY FEATURES ARTWORKS DEPICTING MEMORABLE MOMENTS FROM PELE'S CAREER, INCLUDING A 1977 PORTRAIT BY POP ART PIONEER ANDY WARHOL. UNLIKE TODAY'S STARS, THERE IS NOT A SURFEIT OF FOOTAGE OF PELE IN ACTION, BUT SOME OF HIS GOALS WERE SO FAMOUS THEY ACQUIRED THEIR OWN EPITHETS. THERE WAS 'O MILESIMO', A PENALTY FOR SANTOS -- HIS ONLY BRAZILIAN CLUB -- AGAINST VASCO DA GAMA THAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE HIS 1,000TH GOAL. A PITCH-LONG DRIBBLE AND SHOT AGAINST FLUMINENSE IN 1961 WAS DEEMED WORTHY OF A PLAQUE AT RIO DE JANEIRO'S ICONIC MARACANA, THE GROUND WHERE IT WAS SCORED, EARNING IT THE NICKNAME 'GOL DE PLACA'. MEANWHILE, THE GOAL PELE CONSIDERED HIS BEST, IN WHICH HE REPUTEDLY FLICKED THE BALL OVER THREE DEFENDERS AND THE GOALKEEPER BEFORE HEADING IN DURING A MATCH AGAINST THE BRAZILIAN JUVENTUS IN 1959, WAS RECREATED USING CGI IN 2014. "PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEM UNTIL NOW BECAUSE THEY WERE SO GOOD," SAYS PELE -- FULL NAME EDSON ARANTES DO NASCIMENTO -- OF THE FLUMINENSE AND JUVENTUS GOALS, NEITHER OF WHICH WAS CAUGHT ON FILM. "OF COURSE I HAD OTHER GOALS THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO ME, IN A WORLD CUP TOO. BUT THESE TWO GOALS WERE THE ONES PEOPLE MENTIONED MORE. "THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL GOALS, BUT THERE WERE OTHER IMPORTANT GOALS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 1,000TH GOAL. "IT WAS A PENALTY KICK. EVERYBODY SAID, 'OH, IT'S EASY TO SCORE A GOAL WITH A PENALTY KICK.' "BUT TO ME, IN THE MARACANA, I WAS SHAKING, I WAS SO NERVOUS. I SAID TO MYSELF, 'MY GOD, I CANNOT MISS THIS MOMENT.' THIS 1,000TH GOAL WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME TOO." PELE, WHO UNDERWENT SPINAL SURGERY IN JULY, CONSIDERS LIONEL MESSI TO BE THE WORLD'S BEST CURRENT PLAYER AND CITES ENGLAND'S 1966 WORLD CUP-WINNING MIDFIELDER BOBBY CHARLTON AS HIS "MOST DIFFICULT OPPONENT". CHARLTON WAS RECENTLY SURPASSED BY WAYNE ROONEY AS ENGLAND'S RECORD GOAL-SCORER AND THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT NEYMAR WILL ONE DAY CLAIM PELE'S RECORD FOR BRAZIL. THE BARCELONA FORWARD, 23, HAS ALREADY SCORED 46 INTERNATIONAL GOALS AND HAS PELE'S MARK OF 77 IN HIS SIGHTS. BUT WITH NEYMAR HAVING STARTED OUT, LIKE PELE, AT SANTOS, THE THREE-TIME WORLD CUP-WINNER IS RELAXED ABOUT THE PROSPECT. "COINCIDENTALLY, NEYMAR IS FROM SANTOS. HE STARTED THERE," SAID PELE, WHO ALSO SPENT TWO YEARS AT NEW YORK COSMOS. "MY SON, EDINHO (SENTENCED LAST YEAR TO A 33-YEAR JAIL TERM FOR MONEY LAUNDERING), WHO WAS A GOALKEEPER, WAS HIS COACH IN THE UNDER-20S. IF NEYMAR BREAKS THIS RECORD, FANTASTIC. ONE MORE FOR SANTOS!" AS MUCH AS HE ENJOYS WATCHING NEYMAR AND MESSI STRUT THEIR STUFF, HOWEVER, PELE RESORTS TO AN OLD REFRAIN WHEN ASKED IF ANYONE IN THE MODERN GAME REMINDS HIM OF HIMSELF. "I USED TO SAY: 'LISTEN, EVERYBODY WANTS TO FIND A NEW PELE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE,'" HE SAYS. "MY MOTHER AND MY FATHER CLOSED THE MACHINE. NO MORE!" FOLLOW TOI SPORTS ON TWITTER @TOISPORTSNEWS

15	WAIT OF THE WORLD POSTED ONSEPTEMBER 25, 2015BYBY KEVIN BOYLEINBOYLEING POINTS BY KEVIN BOYLE WHEN I WAS MY SONS AGE WERE COMING TO HIM IN A SECOND I RANG A DOORBELL AND NOBODY ANSWERED. I WAITED A FEW BEATS AND HIT THE BELL AGAIN. WHEN THE DOOR OPENED, SOME ZEN-SOAKED GUY SAID, PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE. THAT LITTLE NUGGET STAYED WITH ME. AT LEAST THE WORDS DID. DECADES LATER, IM STILL NOT VIRTUOUS. I WAS REMINDED OF THIS SHORTCOMING BY MY SON. NOW, IT WASNT THE MOST PROFOUND THING MY SON HAS EVER SAID. COME TO THINK OF IT, PROFOUND HASNT HAPPENED YET. HES STILL A TEENAGER, SO THE PROFOUND STUFF IS A WAYS OFF. AT LEAST UNTIL HE DOES WHAT JEB BUSH DID 40 YEARS AGO (FOR THOSE WHO MISSED THE LAST CANDIDATES DEBATE: JEB SMOKED THE DEVILS LETTUCE IN A COLLEGE DORM ROOM). ANYWAY, MY SON SAID THE EQUIVALENT OF THE SKY IS BLUE. HE SAID, DAD, YOU HATE TO WAIT. NO SHITSKI, SHERLOCK, I SAID. INTRODUCE ME TO SOMEONE WHO DOES. NO, BUT YOUREALLYHATE IT. IM SURE THIS EXCHANGE CAME AFTER I LEFT A DOCTORS OFFICE BEFORE ACTUALLY SEEING THE DOCTOR OR GOT OFF THE LINE AT THE POST OFFICE. MY SON WOULD RATHER ENDURE A LONG WAIT THAN FEEL THE EYES OF OTHERS AS THEY FALL UPON US ON OUR WAY OUT. FOR HIM, ITS REAL SIMPLE. THOSE OTHER PEOPLE WAITING ARE GONNA THINK WERE JERKS IF WE JUST LEAVE. I TRY TO TELL HIM THE PEOPLE BEHIND US WONT THINK WERE JERKS. THEYLL THINK WE DID THEM A FAVOR. I KNOW OTHERWISE THOUGH. JUST BECAUSE THE LINE GOT SHORTER, DOESNT MEAN THE WAIT DID. SEE, THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE: THOSE WHO SHIFT LANES IN CLOGGED TRAFFIC TO GET IN THE FASTEST MOVING LANE AND THOSE WHO WAIT PATIENTLY IN THE LANE THEYRE ALREADY IN. I SHIFT LANES. IM NOT SAYING SHIFTING IS THE SURE FIRE WAY TO GO. PLENTY OF TIMES IVE SWUNG INTO A LANE ONLY TO SEE THE LANE I JUST MOVED FROM OPEN UP. IN THOSE CASES, I USUALLY BLAME MYSELF FOR MISREADING THE TRAFFIC FLOW OR JUST MY BAD LUCK PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE. FORGET VIRTUE. I JUST WANT TO RIP THE STEERING WHEEL OFF. SOMETIMES YOURE FORCED INTO A DEAD END, LIKE WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN SEARS. IS THERE A WORSE PLACE TO GET ON LINE? YOU JUST NEED A SHIRT OR BELT AND YOU SEE THE DREADED LINE. I START THINKING MAYBE I DONT NEED A SHIRT; MAYBE I COULD USE THE CARS JUMPER CABLES FOR A BELT. OF COURSE, SOME DOCTORS ARE NO BETTER THAN SEARS. THEYVE GOT WAITING ROOMS THAT LOOK LIKE THE VAN WYCK ON FRIDAY RUSH HOUR. WE HAD SOME EMERGENCIES; A LOT OF PEOPLE CAME IN SICK, THEYLL TELL ME AT THE DESK. THEN I WAIT AND STEW AND RESENT THE DOCTOR. WHEN I GET IN THE ROOM I CANT DECIDE IF I WANT TO ASK FIFTY QUESTIONS AND GET MY FAIR SHARE OF TIME OR HURRY IT UP AND DO RIGHT BY THE PEOPLE WAITING. ITS NOT JUST THE WAIT AT THE DOCTORS. I KNOW WHEN I LEAVE ILL BE GETTING CAUGHT AT EVERY RED LIGHT. FULL RED LIGHTS. THE KIND JUST TURNING RED AS YOU GET THERE SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT OUT THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE. I HATE MAYOR DE BLASIO FOR THIS. HE HIRED THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONER WHO IS IN CHARGE OF TRAFFIC LIGHTS. SHES EITHER DOING A LOUSY JOB OR IS DOING WHAT THE MAYOR WANTS. I HATE DE BLASIO IN EITHER CASE. OF COURSE, BECAUSE I LACK THE PATIENCE VIRTUE I LOOK TOO HAPPY AND DOWNRIGHT GOOFY SOMETIMES. RECENTLY I WALKED INTO THE POST OFFICE AND THERE WAS NOBODY ON LINE, I MEAN NOBODY. I LOOKED AROUND FOR A HIDDEN CAMERA. THERES A PRANK COMING AND THEYRE FILMING IT. THIS JUST CANT BE TRUE. I WALKED, I GLIDED, UP TO THE WINDOW. SORRY, OUR COMPUTERS ARE DOWN. YOURE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT. NOW I WISH THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE THERE SO I COULD ROLL MY EYES AND SHAKE MY HEAD AND SHARE THE PAIN. SO, THE QUESTION IS, WHATS THE RUSH? I HAVE NO IDEA AND IM IN NO HURRY TO FIND OUT.
16	IN 1851 A RADICAL LOOKING SCHOONER GHOSTED OUT OF THE AFTERNOON MIST AND SWIFTLY SAILED PAST THE ROYAL YACHT STATIONED IN THE SOLENT, BETWEEN THE ISLE OF WIGHT AND THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND, ON AN AFTERNOON WHEN QUEEN VICTORIA WAS WATCHING A SAILING RACE. AS THE SCHOONER, NAMED AMERICA, PASSED THE ROYAL YACHT IN FIRST POSITION, AND SALUTED BY DIPPING ITS ENSIGN THREE TIMES, QUEEN VICTORIA ASKED ONE OF HER ATTENDANTS TO TELL HER WHO WAS IN SECOND PLACE.YOUR MAJESTY, THERE IS NO SECOND, CAME THE REPLY. THAT PHRASE, JUST FOUR WORDS, IS STILL THE BEST DESCRIPTION OF THE AMERICAS CUP, AND HOW IT REPRESENTS THE SINGULAR PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE. THAT DAY IN AUGUST, 1851, THE YACHT AMERICA, REPRESENTING THE YOUNG NEW YORK YACHT CLUB, WOULD GO ON TO BEAT THE BEST THE BRITISH COULD OFFER AND WIN THE ROYAL YACHT SQUADRONS 100 POUND CUP. THIS WAS MORE THAN A SIMPLE BOAT RACE HOWEVER, AS IT SYMBOLISED A GREAT VICTORY FOR THE NEW WORLD OVER THE OLD, A TRIUMPH THAT UNSEATED GREAT BRITAIN AS THE WORLDS UNDISPUTED MARITIME POWER. THE TROPHY WOULD GO TO THE YOUNG DEMOCRACY OF THE UNITED STATES AND IT WOULD BE WELL OVER 100 YEARS BEFORE IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM NEW YORK. SHORTLY AFTER AMERICA WON THE 100 GUINEA CUP IN 1851, NEW YORK YACHT CLUB COMMODORE JOHN COX STEVENS AND THE REST OF HIS OWNERSHIP SYNDICATE SOLD THE CELEBRATED SCHOONER AND RETURNED HOME TO NEW YORK AS HEROES. THEY DONATED THE TROPHY TO THE NEW YORK YACHT CLUB UNDER A DEED OF GIFT, WHICH STATED THAT THE TROPHY WAS TO BE A PERPETUAL CHALLENGE CUP FOR FRIENDLY COMPETITION BETWEEN NATIONS. THUS WAS BORN THE AMERICAS CUP, NAMED AFTER THE WINNING SCHOONER AMERICA, AS OPPOSED TO THE COUNTRY. THE AMERICAS CUP IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST DIFFICULT TROPHY IN SPORT TO WIN. IN THE MORE THAN 150 YEARS SINCE THAT FIRST RACE OFF ENGLAND, ONLY FOUR NATIONS HAVE WON WHAT IS OFTEN CALLED THE OLDEST TROPHY IN INTERNATIONAL SPORT. FOR SOME PERSPECTIVE, CONSIDER THAT THERE HAD BEEN NINE CONTESTS FOR THE AMERICAS CUP BEFORE THE FIRST MODERN OLYMPIC GAMES WERE HELD IN ATHENS IN 1896.
17	FIRST DEMONSTRATION OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE VIEW 0 COMMENTS EMERGING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE ARXIV SEPTEMBER 10, 2015 FIRST DEMONSTRATION OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE NEXT TIME YOU NEED TO CHOOSE, WHY NOT LET A PHOTON MAKE THE DECISION INSTEAD? IMAGINE WALKING INTO A CASINO TO PLAY THE ONE-ARMED BANDITS.YOUVE HEARD THAT ONE OF THEM PAYS OUT MORE THAN THE OTHERS, SO YOUR GOAL IS TO FIND OUT WHICH. BUT HOW MUCH OF YOUR RESOURCES SHOULD YOU POUR INTO EXPLORING THE MACHINES BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO EXPLOIT ONE OF THEM? THIS PROBLEM IS KNOWN AS THE EXPLORATION-EXPLOITATION DILEMMA, AND IT CROPS UP IN ALL KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES, FROM OIL EXPLORATION TO GAMBLING TO BUSINESS PLANNING. THE DIFFICULTY, OF COURSE, IS THAT THE MACHINES ARE PROBABILISTIC, SO IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO BE TRICKED INTO PLAYING A POORLY PAYING MACHINE BY A GOOD RUN THAT OCCURS BY CHANCE. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF ALGORITHMS THAT CAN HELP. THESE ARE COMPUTER PROGRAMS OF VARYING DEGREES OF COMPLEXITY THAT SIMULATE WHAT IS GOING ON AND USE PROBABILITY THEORY TO CALCULATE THE BEST NEXT MOVE. BUT NOW THERE IS ANOTHER WAY. TODAY, MAKOTO NARUSE AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY IN TOKYO, JAPAN, AND PALS POINT OUT THAT THE LAWS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS ARE PROBABILISTIC, AND SO PROVIDE A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT FOR DECISION THEORY. AND THATS ALLOWED THEM TO BUILD AN EXTRAORDINARY DECISION-MAKING DEVICE. THEIR NEW TOY IS A PHOTON GUN AND A SINGLE PHOTON DETECTOR THAT USES THE LAWS OF PHYSICS TO MAKE DECISIONS, RATHER THAN COMPLEX ALGORITHMS. THE DEVICE RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS KIND OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE COULD HELP MAKE COMPLEX DECISIONS. THE THEORY IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. ONE STRATEGY TO FIND THE BEST PAYING ONE-ARMED BANDIT IS TO START FEEDING THE MACHINES AND COUNT HOW MUCH THEY PAY OUT EACH TIME. THEN, AS YOU LEARN, FEED MORE INTO THE MACHINES THAT PAY BETTER UNTIL YOU FIND THE BEST. THE SINGLE PHOTON DECISION MAKER DOES ALL THIS AUTOMATICALLY. IT CONSISTS OF A GUN THAT FIRES PHOTONS THROUGH A POLARIZING FILTER. THIS FILTER CAN BE ADJUSTED TO POLARIZE THE PHOTONS HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY. WHEN IT IS AT 45 DEGREES, HOWEVER, EACH PHOTON HAS AN EQUAL CHANCE OF BEING HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY POLARIZED. SO THIS SET UP PRODUCES A STEADY STREAM OF PHOTONS POLARIZED EITHER HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY WITH A 50 PERCENT CHANCE OF EACH. ROTATING THE FILTER CHANGES THESE ODDS. MOVING THE FILTER TOWARD THE VERTICAL INCREASES THE CHANCES OF VERTICAL POLARIZATION WHILE REDUCING THE CHANCES OF HORIZONTAL POLARIZATION. SO IN THIS SETUP, MORE PHOTONS WILL BE VERTICALLY POLARIZED. NEXT, NARUSE AND CO USE THE POLARIZATION OF THE PHOTONS TO CHOOSE WHICH OF TWO SLOT MACHINES TO PLAY. FOR EXAMPLE, A VERTICAL PHOTON MEANS A PLAY ON THE FIRST BANDIT WHILE A HORIZONTAL PHOTON MEANS A PLAY ON THE SECOND BANDIT. THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS COMES BY CREATING A FEEDBACK LOOP THAT CHANGES THE ORIENTATION OF THE POLARIZING FILTER AFTER EACH PLAY. SO IF THE FIRST BANDIT PAYS OUT, THE FILTER MOVES TO THE VERTICAL MAKING IT MORE LIKELY TO BE PLAYED IN FUTURE. BUT IF A HORIZONTAL PHOTON TRIGGERS A PAYOUT, THE FILTER MOVES TO THE HORIZONTAL. IN THIS WAY, THE PHOTON MACHINE LEARNS WHICH MACHINE PAYS OUT MORE OFTEN. WHATS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS SETUP IS THAT IT REQUIRES NO STANDARD COMPUTING, NO SIMULATION OF THE SYSTEM, AND NO NUMBER CRUNCHING OF PROBABILITIES. INSTEAD, THE LAWS OF PHYSICS MAKE THE DECISION VIA A SIMPLE FEEDBACK MECHANISM. THIS IS NOT JUST THEORETICAL WORK. NARUSE AND CO HAVE BUILT THEIR OWN PHOTON DECISION-MAKER USING A PHOTON GUN MADE FROM A NITROGEN VACANCY IN NANODIAMAOND. THE PHOTONS FROM THIS DEVICE DETERMINE WHICH OF TWO SLOT MACHINES TO PLAY WITH THE RESULTS FED BACK TO CHANGE THE ORIENTATION OF A POLARIZATION FILTER. THE RESULTS ARE IMPRESSIVE. THE SINGLE PHOTON DECISION-MAKER QUICKLY FINDS THE BEST PAYING BANDIT AND EVEN CHANGES ITS MIND WHEN NARUSE AND CO CHANGE THE PAYOUT ODDS OF THE MACHINES. WE EXPERIMENTALLY DEMONSTRATE ACCURATE AND ADAPTIVE DECISION MAKING, THEY SAY. THATS INTERESTING WORK THAT HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR INTELLIGENT MACHINES. ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS NEW MACHINE IS ITS SIMPLICITYIT REQUIRES NO STANDARD COMPUTING MACHINERY AT ALL. IT CAN ALSO BE TINY, OPERATING ON A SCALE OF NANOMETERS WHILE USING VERY LITTLE POWER. BUT IT IS CONCEPTUALLY WHERE THE NEW DEVICE MIGHT HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT. THERE IS A CLEAR FEELING THAT INTELLIGENT MACHINES MUST RELY ON ELECTRONIC COMPUTATION TO MAKE DECISIONS. NARUSE AND CO SHOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. INSTEAD, A NEW KIND OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE USES THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AND CLEVER DESIGN SEEM TO DECIDE FOR ITSELF.

18	MISTAKES ARE A NORMAL PHENOMENON IN LIFE. ALL HAVE, AT ONE TIME OR THE OTHER, COMMITTED A MISTAKE. SOME ARE DUE TO IGNORANCE, WHILE OTHERS ARE DUE TO SHEER FOOLHARDINESS. GENERALLY, WE TEND TO LEARN LESSONS FROM OUR MISTAKES, WHICH IN TURN HELP TO IMPROVE UPON OUR SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS IN LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR. WHILE SOME CONTINUALLY MAKE MISTAKES AND GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE LEARNING FROM THEM, LIFE DOES NOT AFFORD OTHERS THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY. A SINGLE MISTAKE FROM SUCH PERSONS IS ENOUGH TO LEAD TO YEARS OF SUFFERING. SOMETIMES A SINGLE MISTAKE IS ENOUGH TO LEAD THEM TO ETERNAL DAMNATION. THERE IS THIS TRAGIC STORY THAT I NEVER CEASE TO TELL MY STUDENTS. IT WAS ABOUT A BLOKE CALLED ELVIS. HE CAME FROM A POOR FAMILY BUT WAS SUCH A BRILLIANT, RESPECTFUL AND HARDWORKING STUDENT. HIS AMBITION WAS TO BECOME EITHER A DOCTOR OR AN ENGINEER. HE HAD HIS BASIC EDUCATION IN ONE OF THE REMOTEST PARTS OF THE VOLTA REGION BUT MANAGED TO MAKE SIX ONES. HIS AMBITION SEEMED TO BE ON COURSE WHEN HE GAINED ADMISSION INTO ONE OF THE BEST SCIENCE SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY. HE WON MANY ACADEMIC AWARDS IN THE SCHOOL DUE TO HIS DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK. IT WAS WHILE HE WAS AWAITING HIS SECONDARY SCHOOL RESULTS THAT A SINGLE MISTAKE LED TO HIS TRAGIC END. HE HAD A COUSIN WHO WAS A BICYCLE REPAIRER. BEING A VERY HARDWORKING BLOKE, HE DECIDED TO USE HIS HOLIDAYS TO LEARN BICYCLE REPAIRS FROM THE COUSIN. THE COUSIN WAS HOWEVER A BELIEVER IN THE EFFICACY OF THE GANJA HERB, POPULARLY KNOWN AS INDIAN HEMP. ONE DAY IN HIS BID TO CONVINCE THE COUSIN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO GAIN FROM GANJA , HE FOOLISHLY ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE TO SMOKE A ROLL OF THE HERB TO DISPROVE THE BELIEF THAT IT WAS EFFICACIOUS. AND THAT WAS HIS DOOM! SOON AFTER HE FINISHED SMOKING, HIS MIND STARTED PLAYING GAMES WITH HIM AND HE STARTED ACTING IN A FUNNY WAY. THAT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE, CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT HE HAD HITHERTO NOT EVEN SMOKED A CIGARETTE. IN THAT SCHIZOPHRENIC STATE, HE RUSHED HOME. HE MISTOOK A BOTTLE OF ACID GIVEN TO HIM FOR SAFEKEEPING FOR A MINERAL AND GULPED THE CONTENT. THE RESULT WAS A HUGE TRAGEDY. THE CORROSIVE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE DID NOT GIVE HIM ANY CHANCE OF SURVIVAL. HE JOINED HIS ANCESTORS IN SAMANFOLAND BEFORE THEY COULD REACH A MEDICAL FACILITY. BUT THAT WAS AFTER HE HAD HAD TO ENDURE SEVERE PAIN AND SUFFERING. MY POINT IS THAT A SINGLE MISTAKE COULD LEAD TO A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT MAY LEAD TO ONES DOOM. AS THE HEADING MAY HAVE HINTED, MY FOCUS IS ON THOSE RIDING ON THE GREAT ELEPHANT. BEING A HUMAN INSTITUTION, THE OSONO MAY HAVE MADE SOME MISTAKES IN THE PAST AND LEARNT LESSONS FROM THEM. BUT TRUST ME; ITS LATEST MISTAKE IS A VERY GRAVE ONE AND COULD GRADUALLY LEAD TO ITS UNDOING. THE CHOICE OF PAUL AFOKO AND KWABENA AGYAPONG AS CHAIRMAN AND GENERAL SECRETARY RESPECTIVELY IS WHAT I REFER TO. I DID SUPPORT KWABENAS BID DURING THE PARTY CONTEST, BUT HINDSIGHT HAS MADE ME WISER. AS FOR AFOKO, I SUSPECTED HE WOULD BE A DISASTER SO I THREW MY WEIGHT BEHIND A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE. AS WE ALL KNOW, AFOKO DID WIN THE CONTEST; AND IM SAD TO SAY HE HAS SO FAR PROVED ME RIGHT. MY RELIGIOUS UPBRINGING DOES NOT PERMIT ME TO ACCUSE OTHERS OF ILL-MOTIVE WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE, SO I WOULD NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THE AGENDA 2020 OPERATION THE DUO IS BEING ACCUSED OF. BUT THEIR ACTIONS SINCE ASSUMING OFFICE HAVE LEFT NO DOUBT IN MANY MINDS THAT THEIR SELECTION WAS A GRAVE MISTAKE. THE BELLIGERENT ATTITUDE OF THE DUO TOWARDS THE OTHER PARTY OFFICIALS HAS CONTINUALLY HEIGHTENED TENSIONS AMONG THE RANK AND FILE. SOME UNILATERAL ACTIONS OF THEIRS WHICH READILY COME TO MIND ARE THE ABORTIVE DISMISSAL OF MARTIN ADJEI KORSAH AND THE CHANGING OF SECURITY GUARDS AT THE PARTYS HEADQUARTERS, WHICH LED TO ARMED ALTERCATIONS AMONG PARTY FOLKS IN FULL GLARE OF THE MEDIA. THE HEIGHTENED TENSIONS THAT LED TO THE UNFORTUNATE ACID-POURING SAGA WERE AVOIDABLE. THE I-AM-EATING-FUFU EPISODE BY KWABENA HAS DONE THE PARTY MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THE RECENT ORCHESTRATION TO TARNISH THE IMAGE OF SOME PARTY OFFICIALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING INTERNAL CORRUPTION HAS ALSO GIVEN RISE TO MANY QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. WHY IS THE DUO SILENT ON THE ALLEGATION OF A SECRET ECOBANK ACCOUNT, WHEN THEY KNOW TOO WELL THAT THE ACCOUNT HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR CLOSE TO SEVEN YEARS? WHY DID THEY REFUSE TO SIGN THE ECOBANK SIGNATURE FORM, ONLY TO TURNAROUND TO ISSUE PRESS STATEMENTS PURPORTING TO FIGHT CORRUPTION? AND WHAT WAS THE REAL MOTIVE FOR THE PRESS RELEASE? FOR SURE, THE SECRET ACCOUNT ALLEGATION AND THE ILL-TIMED PRESS STATEMENT HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR PURPOSE. THEY HAVE INDEED TAKEN THE SHINE OFF NANA ADDOS ARISE AND BUILD TOUR AND BROUGHT NEGATIVE STORIES ABOUT THE PARTY BACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT. DID I HEAR YOU SAY SABOTAGE? I DONT KNOW WHAT NANA ADDO IS THINKING. BUT IF I WERE HIM, I WOULD BE THINKING OF HOW TO CORRECT THE GRAVE MISTAKE THE PARTY MADE IN TAMALE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM, THIS IS ONE OF THE RARE MISTAKES THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO RECTIFY. HMM, COULD THIS BE THE MISTAKE TO LEAD THE PARTY TO ETERNAL DAMNATION? MASSA, WITH SUCH HIGH LEVELS OF INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION BEING DISPLAYED BY THE SO-CALLED RESURRECTED GOAT AND HIS CRONIES, I SHUDDER TO IMAGINE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF MISRULE UNDER SUCH CONFUSED GOATS.

22	ONCE CHARLIE PARKER, DIZZY GILLESPIE, THELONIOUS MONK, BUD POWELL, CURLEY RUSSELL, MAX ROACH AND OTHER BLACK JAZZ MUSICIANS PIONEERED BEBOP AND BEGAN RECORDING THE REVOLUTIONARY STYLE IN 1945, OTHER GIFTED JAZZ ARTISTS OF THE PERIOD QUICKLY FIGURED OUT THE NEW LANGUAGE. AMONG THE MOST EXCITING AND PROFICIENT BOP GROUPS OF 1947 WAS THE SHORT-LIVED SERGE CHALOFF SEXTETTE. THE GROUP RECORDED FOUR SONGS (ENOUGH FOR TWO 78S) AND FEATURED RED RODNEY (TP), EARL SWOPE (TB), SERGE CHALOFF (BAR), GEORGE WALLINGTON (P), CURLY RUSSELL (B) AND TINY KAHN (D). FIVE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP WERE IN THE GEORGE AULD SEXTET, WHICH GIGGED IN NEW YORK BUT, SADLY, DID NOT RECORD. SWOPE WAS ADDED IN PLACE OF AULD. [PICTURED FROM LEFT, THE GEORGE CHALOFF SEXTETTE: GEORGE WALLINGTON, CURLEY RUSSELL, RED RODNEY, TINY KAHN, EARL SWOPE, TEDDY REIG (PARTIALLY HIDDEN) AND SERGE CHALOFF, COURTESY OF THE INSTITUTE OF JAZZ STUDIES] EARLIER IN '47, IN JANUARY, RODNEY HAD LED A BOP SEXTET SESSION FOR KEYNOTE, WITH CHALOFF, ALLEN EAGER (TS), AL HAIG (P), CHUBBY JACKSON (B) AND KAHN. TWO MONTHS LATER, CHALOFF PUT HIS SEXTET TOGETHER FOR SAVOY. THE RODNEY DATE IS STRONG BUT NOT NEARLY AS HAIR-RAISING, SINCE THE BAND RELIED ON AL COHN AND GERRY MULLIGAN ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH HAD A CERTAIN CIVILITY. [PHOTO OF SERGE CHALOFF ABOVE IN 1948 BY POPSIE RANDOLPH, COURTESY OF THE FRANK DRIGGS COLLECTION] ON THE SERGE CHALOFF SEXTETTE DATE, THREE OF THE FOUR SONGS RECORDED PUMPERNICKEL, SERGE'S URGE AND BAR A SECOND WERE WRITTEN AND ARRANGED BY CHALOFF WHILE THE FOURTH, GABARDINE AND SERGE, WAS BY KAHN. ALL FOUR TUNES ARE DAREDEVIL CUTE AND BLISTERINGLY FAST. THEY SHOWCASE TIGHT UNISON LINES AND STANDOUT SOLOS BY FOUR OF THE SIX MUSICIANS, WHO ARE IN SUPERB FORM. PUMPERNICKEL, FOR EXAMPLE, STARTS WITH AN IMPECCABLE PACE-SETTER BY PIANIST WALLINGTON. AFTER A BREATHLESS 16 BARS BY THE GROUP, CHALOFF SHOWS OFF HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND LEONINE APPROACH TO THE BARITONE SAX. HE'S FOLLOWING BY RODNEY ON TRUMPET, WHO IS STILL VASTLY UNDERRATED AS A SWINGING BOPPER. SWOPE'S ATTACK ON TROMBONE IS FORCEFUL AND SPIRITED, WITH A SEXY BOP SWAGGER. [PHOTO OF SERGE CHALOFF ABOVE IN 1948 BY POPSIE RANDOLPH, COURTESY OF THE FRANK DRIGGS COLLECTION] THE FOUR CHALOFF LEADERSHIP TRACKS FROM 1947 ARE TERRIFIC ENTRY POINTS FOR LISTENERS INTERESTED IN ANY OR ALL OF THE MUSICIANS INVOLVED AND BEBOP IN GENERAL. ALL I'LL SAY IS THAT THE YEARS AFTER WORLD WAR II MUST HAVE BEEN A TRIP IN NEW YORK.

25	JEPKEMOI LAUNCHED AN INNOVATIVE MARKETING AND PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM IN 2009.  IN A RECENT PRESENTATION, I WENT INTO SOME DETAIL ABOUT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE MARKETS DEEP AUGUST DIVE. SHE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO CLIENT NEEDS AND QUICKLY GAINED A SOLID FOOTHOLD IN THE NAIROBI, AND LATER MOMBASA, MARKET. HER TOP LINE REVENUES TRIPLED EACH YEAR BETWEEN 2010 AND 2012 AND DOUBLED AFTERWARDS UNTIL SALES TOOK A NOSEDIVE IN 2014. HALFWAY THROUGH 2015, JEPKEMOI DECIDED TO SEND OUT ONLINE SURVEYS TO HER EXISTING, FORMER AND PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS. MUCH TO HER DISMAY, QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS INDICATED A MARKET PERCEPTION THAT HER FIRMS ONCE COVETED CREATIVITY HAD DISSIPATED AND WOULD-BE CLIENTS VIEWED THE COMPANY AS DECIDEDLY NOT INNOVATIVE. PUZZLED, JEPKEMOI ATTEMPTED TO THINK THROUGH WHAT UNDERPINNED THE DISMAL FEEDBACK. INITIALLY TEMPTED TO BLAME INCREASED COMPETITION, SHE DECIDED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.  SO, TO BE ACCUSED OF THAT WAS PRETTY LOW, BUT WE GOT THROUGH IT AND WE BATTLED ON, AND I THINK WE HAD A WIN FOR EVERYBODY IN THAT RESPECT." HALFORD ALSO TALKED WAY SOCIETY HAS BECOME, IN HIS VIEW, TOO POLITICALLY CORRECT. THE ONLY MAJOR CHANGE IN HER BUSINESS INVOLVED HIRING OF A NEW CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER (CMO) IN FEBRUARY 2014. HOWEVER, JEPKEMOI THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY THAT THE CMO CHANGE COULD HAVE LED TO THE DEMISE OF THE FIRMS INNOVATION. SHE VIEWED THE CMO AS A GO-GETTER, ORGANISED AND MUCH IN CONTROL OF ALL EXTERNAL ASPECTS OF THE MARKETING AND PUBLIC RELATIONS BUSINESS. JEPKEMOI DECIDED TO SET UP A BREAKFAST MEETING WITH A FORMER MBA COLLEAGUE WHO SEEMED TO KNOW STRATEGY AND ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENT MATTERS. BETWEEN SIPS OF COFFEE, HER FRIEND EXPLAINED THE DELICATE BALANCE OF MAINTAINING CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION IN A COMPANY. SHE RECOMMENDED THAT JEPKEMOI USE AN INTERNAL SURVEY OF HER STAFF TO GAUGE THEIR CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS TOWARDS INNOVATION. THE FRIEND POINTED OUT HOW RESEARCHERS LIKE SCOTT HELM AND FREDRIK ANDERSSON EMPLOY THE INNOVATION TOOL IN SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS BUSINESSES LIKE HERS. EAGER TO DIAGNOSE ANY ISSUES AND SAVE HER FIRM, JEPKEMOI QUICKLY DOWNLOADED THE SURVEY TOOL AND OBTAINED RESPONSES FROM HER ENTIRE TEAM.  LONDON RESORT COMPANY HOLDINGS DIRECTOR FENLON DUNPHY, ON BEHALF PARAMOUNT, SAID: WHILE THERE IS A LACK OF SUITABLE SUPPLY OF BUSINESS PREMISES IN THE IMMEDIATE LOCALITY, OUR AGENTS ARE UNDERTAKING A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH FOR PREMISES WITHIN GRAVESHAM, DARTFORD AND THE WIDER REGION TOWARDS MEDWAY AND MAIDSTONE. AFTERWARDS, NOT ONLY DID THE RESULTS SURPRISE HER, BUT SO DID THE RESEARCH FRAMEWORKS IMPLICATIONS FOR WHAT LEADS TO AN INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE BUSINESS. JEPKEMOI, LIKE MOST EXECUTIVES, DID NOT GRASP THE ROOT INTERNAL ANTECEDENTS THAT FOSTER EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION. RESEARCH BY ROBERT DEVELLIS SHOWS THAT MANAGERS CAN PREDICT FUTURE INNOVATION SUCCESS BY THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEIR EMPLOYEES PERCEIVE THE FOLLOWING THREE CREATIVE DRIVERS: PROACTIVENESS, RISK TAKING AND INNOVATION ORIENTATION. EXECUTIVES MUST FOSTER THESE THREE CAUSES OF INNOVATION TO BENEFIT FROM GREATER CREATIVITY. FIRST, DO EMPLOYEES FEEL THAT VALUED OR FROWNED UPON? EXECUTIVES PREFER PROACTIVE EMPLOYEES.  SO ONE MUST EXAMINE HOW EMPLOYEES TRULY FEEL. FURTHER, THE EXECUTIVE MUST LOOK AT HIS OR HER PAST PERFORMANCE WITH REGARDS TO PROACTIVENESS. IS YOUR FIRM SELDOM OR OFTEN THE FIRST ORGANISATION TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES, ADMINISTRATIVE TECHNIQUES OR OPERATING PROCESSES? DOES YOUR COMPANY EXPLOIT OR LAG CHANGES IN THE FIELD? ALSO, DO YOU PROVIDE THE LEAD FOR SIMILAR SERVICE PROVIDERS OR YOU FOLLOW OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS? THE TOUGH INTROSPECTIVE QUESTIONS CONTINUE WHEN ASSESSING YOUR EMPLOYEES AND TOLERANCE AND HISTORY OF RISK TAKING. IF YOU HARSHLY PUNISH ERRANT OUTCOMES DESPITE CAREFUL PRE-PLANNING, THEN YOU SQUASH RISK TAKING. EMPLOYEES WHO FEEL EXPOSED TO CASTIGATION FOR TAKING CHANCES BECOME DRASTICALLY LESS CREATIVE IN THEIR WORKPLACE. ADDITIONALLY, DOES YOUR COMPANY SPECIFICALLY CONDUCT ITSELF IN LINE WITH THE BEHAVIOURAL NORMS OF YOUR INDUSTRY OR DO YOU BREAK OUTSIDE THE BOX NORMAL WORKPLACE REPORTING TIMES, MANNERS OF DRESS, EMPLOYEE TEAM REPORTING OR STAFF REWARDS? DO YOU STAY IN SAFE TERRITORY BY ACQUIRING NEW PROJECTS THAT FIT WITH YOUR PUBLIC IMAGE OR ALLOW YOUR FIRM TO TAKE ON NEW PROJECTS THAT WILL ALTER ITS PUBLIC IMAGE? NEXT, DO YOUR DECISIONS MAINTAIN OR CREATE CHANGES IN STAFF STABILITY? THE ANSWER TO THESE QUESTIONS POINT TO THE AMOUNT OF ORGANISATIONAL RISK YOU TAKE. FINALLY, LOOK INTO INNOVATION ORIENTATION ITSELF. DO YOU REWARD NEW WAYS OF ACCOMPLISHING TASKS? DO YOU HOLD INTERNAL COMPETITIONS FOR THE MOST CREATIVE SOLUTIONS? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HELD AN INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY WORKSHOP FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES? ORGANISATIONALLY, DOES RETAIN A HISTORY OF STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR MAINTAIN TRIED-AND-TRUE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES? CAN YOUR FIRM BOAST A RECORD OF SOLID DEVELOPMENT OF NEW INTERNAL PROCESSES OR THE USE OF ESTABLISHED METHODS? HAVE YOU INTRODUCED MULTIPLE NEW PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND POLICIES IN THE PAST OR INTRODUCED FEW OR NONE? WERE MOST MODIFICATIONS IN INTERNAL PROCESSES, SERVICES, PRODUCTS AND POLICIES MAJOR CHANGES OR MINOR CHANGES? THESE WILL REVEAL YOUR APTITUDE FOR CREATIVITY. IN SUMMARY, JEPKEMOI MUST REMOVE OR COACH HER CMO TO FOSTER PROACTIVENESS, RISK TAKING AND INNOVATION ORIENTATION IN ORDER TO REAP THE PROFITABLE REWARDS THAT GREATER INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY BRINGS TO AN ORGANISATION. HOW DOES YOUR COMPANY FALL WITHIN THE ABOVE MEASURES? SHARE YOUR IDEAS ON HOW TO FOSTER THE ANTECEDENTS OF INNOVATION IN YOUR FIRM WITH OTHER BUSINESS DAILY READERS THROUGH #INNOVATIONFORUM ON TWITTER.

26	FROM A NOTORIOUS CON MAN TO CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES, THIS GRAND HOME -- NAY, THIS GRAND COMPOUND -- IN THE HEART OF THE LOS FELIZ NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES HAS HOUSED QUITE A CAST OF CHARACTERS OVER THE YEARS. WITH 14 BEDROOMS AND EIGHT BATHROOMS, IT'S RICH WITH HISTORY AND BRIMMING WITH POSSIBILITIES. BUILT IN 1929 BY ARCHITECT HARLEY S.  OVER THE YEARS, PLATT HIRED ARCHITECTS PAUL R. WILLIAMS AND ALBERT E. HANSEN , TO EXPAND IT, ADDING A POOL, TENNIS COURTS, AND ANOTHER STORY TO BRING IT TO ITS CURRENT 10,000-SQUARE-FOOT MEASUREMENT. THE NEXT OWNER WAS A NOTORIOUS CON MAN NAMED , WHOM LISTING AGENT DAVID SOLOMON DESCRIBES AS THE BERNIE MADOFF OF HIS DAY.  AFTER ALL, THESE BLOODS SEEMED TO BE MORE ABOUT TICKING BOXES, THAN ABOUT MY HEALTH AND WELLBEING, IF THEY WERE PREPARED TO STOP MY MEDICATIONS. AFTER HIS COMPANY, THE JULIAN PETROLEUM CORP., WAS FOUND TO HAVE SWINDLED MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE OUT OF $150 MILLION, JULIAN COMMITTED SUICIDE (NOT IN THIS HOME) IN 1934. IN THE LATE 1950S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OWNER TOOK OVER: THE SAINT COLUMBAN'S FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY, A GROUP OF CATHOLIC MISSIONARY PRIESTS WHO STILL LIVE THERE TODAY. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES MADE TO THE HOME OVER THE YEARS (SPACES WERE DIVIDED TO CREATE ADDITIONAL ROOMS TO HOUSE PRIESTS), SOLOMON SAYS THE HOME RETAINS MANY OF ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES, INCLUDING CARVED FIREPLACES AND DETAILED WOODWORK. THE MOST NOTEWORTHY HISTORIC FEATURE IS A CAVE THAT LEADS TO A HIDDEN WINE CELLAR TO A FULL SPEAK-EASY USED DURING PROHIBITION.  SHE ADDS THAT IF TRACY HADNT SAVED HER, KAL AND MADDIE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE. THERE ARE ALSO QUARTERS FOR LIVE-IN STAFF. SOLOMON SAYS IT WILL TAKE THE RIGHT BUYER TO BRING THE HOME TO PRESENT-DAY STANDARDS, BUT THE BE HUGE. CURRENTLY LISTED FOR $5,499,000, THE PROPERTY COULD BE VALUED AT OVER $12 MILLION POSTRENOVATION BASED ON ITS SIZE, HISTORY, AND LOCATION. "WHEN IT'S REDONE, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES IN LOS ANGELES," HE SAYS. ALTHOUGH THE HOME IS SET BACK FROM THE ROAD, IT FEATURES AMAZING CITY VIEWS AND IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HOLLYWOOD'S GREEK THEATRE AND GRIFFITH PARK. AS FOR THE NEIGHBORS, THINK HOLLYWOOD STARS.  IS EXPECTED TO QUALIFY FOR THE FEDERAL INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT.  EZRA SAID A LOT OF PEOPLE MISS THE TWO-STEP PROCESS AND HE SEES THEM RENT A SET OF SCREENS AND JUST USE ONE PER PERSON. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOME BEHIND THIS PROPERTY USED TO BE ROBERT PATTINSON 'S LOVE NEST WITH THEN-GIRLFRIEND KRISTEN STEWART . THE "TWILIGHT" STAR SOLD THE HOME IN 2014, AND NOW JIM PARSONS OF "THE BIG BANG THEORY" LIVES THERE.  PRICE GROWTH IN 2015 IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE 6.2% YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO $433,600. SO WHO'LL BE MAKE THEIR MARK ON THIS HISTORIC HOME? SOLOMON SAYS WHILE IT COULD BE ANYONE FROM A SINGLE FAMILY TO A PRODUCTION COMPANY, THE LUCKY DEFINITELY POSSESS ONE QUALITY.  FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE BY THE END OF THE MONTH WHETHER IT WILL PUT THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST. "THE RIGHT BUYER WILL BE SOMEONE WHO HAS AN APPRECIATION FOR THE TYPE OF HOME THEY JUST DON'T BUILD ANYMORE," HE SAID. "THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS."

29	MAX MUMBY/INDIGO/ (LONDON) -- PRINCE HARRY IS BACK IN GREAT BRITAIN, SPORTING A NEW BEARD AND CELEBRATING HIS 31ST BIRTHDAY AFTER A LONG SUMMER AWAY FROM LONDON AT THE FRONT LINES OF ANTI-POACHING EFFORTS IN AFRICA. HARRY, WHO RETIRED FROM THE MILITARY EARLIER THIS SUMMER, DECIDED TO CELEBRATE HIS BIRTHDAY TUESDAY BY HONORING WORLD WAR II SPITFIRE PILOTS ON THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN. SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL ONCE CALLED THE PILOTS "THE FEW STILL ALIVE" AND HARRY SPENT THE DAY HONORING THE VETERANS, MANY OF WHOM ARE NOW IN THEIR 90S. THE WWII SPITFIRE AND HURRICANE PILOTS TOOK TO THE SKIES AT THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN FLYPAST IN CHICHESTER, ENGLAND, TO MARK THE ANNIVERSARY. PRINCE HARRY, THE FIFTH-IN-LINE TO THE BRITISH THRONE, DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS UNBELIEVABLY FORTUNATE AND LUCKY TO BE CELEBRATING AT THE EVENT ON HIS BIRTHDAY. HARRY, A CERTIFIED PILOT HIMSELF, WAS SUPPOSED TO GET IN THE COCKPIT AND FLY WITH THE VETERANS, BUT WHEN ONE OF THE PLANES BROKE, THE PRINCE GAVE UP HIS SEAT SO THAT 95-YEAR-OLD WING COMMANDER TOM NEIL COULD TAKE PART IN HONORING HIS FELLOW HEROES. I CAN'T BEGIN TO COMPREHEND WHAT THEY MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH, HARRY TOLD BRITAIN'S CHANNEL 4, WHICH IS PREPARING A DOCUMENTARY, BATTLE OF BRITAIN: RETURN OF THE SPITFIRES , ON THE WWII HEROES. WHILE HARRY FOCUSED ON THE VETERANS ON HIS BIRTHDAY, THE PRINCE WILL REPORTEDLY BE THE GUEST OF HONOR AT A BOAT PARTY ON THE THAMES LATER THIS WEEK ORGANIZED BY HIS FRIENDS TO WELCOME HIM BACK. THE PRINCE SPENT THE LAST THREE MONTHS TRACKING LIONS IN A REMOTE REGION OF NAMIBIA AND WORKING ON THE FRONT LINES IN THE ANTI-POACHING EFFORTS TO SAVE THE ENDANGERED RHINO IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. NOW THAT HE IS BACK IN ENGLAND, PRINCE HARRY HAS A BUSY FALL AHEAD OF HIM WITH MULTIPLE ROYAL ENGAGEMENTS AND TWO FOREIGN TRIPS. ON FRIDAY, THE PRINCE, THE PATRON OF ENGLANDS RUGBY FOOTBALL UNION, WILL ATTEND THE RUGBY WORLD CUP WITH HIS BROTHER, PRINCE WILLIAM, AND SISTER-IN-LAW, THE DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE. HARRY WILL FOCUS HIS ATTENTIONS ON WOUNDED SOLDIERS AND VETERANS AGAIN THIS FALL BY HELPING THEM TRANSITION BACK TO WORK AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES. HE WILL SUPPORT, THROUGH HIS CHARITY, WALKING WITH THE WOUNDED, THE WALK OF BRITAIN, AN EXPEDITION IN WHICH FOUR BRITISH AND TWO U.S. WOUNDED VETERANS ARE WALKING 1,000 MILES ACROSS BRITAIN, ENDING AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE IN NOVEMBER. IN LATE OCTOBER, PRINCE HARRY WILL MAKE HIS FIRST OF SEVERAL FOREIGN TRIPS, BEGINNING WITH A TRIP TO WASHINGTON, D.C., TO BEGIN WORK ON THE 2016 INVICTUS GAMES, A WOUNDED WARRIORS ATHLETIC EVENT THAT WILL BE HELD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE U.S. AT ESPNS WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS COMPLEX IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA. FURTHER DOWN THE LINE, PRINCE HARRY WILL VENTURE BACK TO LESOTHO FOR THE OPENING OF THE CHILDREN'S MAMOHATO CENTER, A CHILDRENS CENTER THAT WILL SERVE AS THE FLAGSHIP FACILITY FOR THE AIDS-FOCUSED CHARITY, SENTEBALE, HARRY FOUNDED MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO IN HONOR OF HIS LATE MOTHER, PRINCESS DIANA. PRINCE HARRY WILL ALSO UNDERTAKE A TOUR TO SOUTH AFRICA IN LATE NOVEMBER ON BEHALF OF HIS GRANDMOTHER, THE QUEEN. COPYRIGHT 2015, ABC RADIO. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
30	ARCHIVE LONDON: TROUBLESOME CHELSEA STRIKER DIEGO COSTA WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A PETTY CRIMINAL RATHER THAN A MASTER VILLAIN IN THE 1950S AND 1960S, ACCORDING TO BRAZIL GREAT PELE. COSTA, WHO WAS BORN IN BRAZIL BUT OPTED TO REPRESENT SPAIN AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, HAS BEEN BANNED FOR THREE GAMES FOR TWICE HITTING LAURENT KOSCIELNY DURING CHELSEA'S 2-0 DEFEAT OF ARSENAL LAST WEEKEND. IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE SNARLING CENTRE-FORWARD HAS FALLEN FOUL OF THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES, BUT PELE, FAMOUSLY KICKED OUT OF THE 1966 WORLD CUP BY PORTUGAL'S JOAO MORAIS, SAID COSTA'S CRIMES WERE NOTHING COMPARED TO THE PUNISHMENTS METED OUT TO HIM DURING HIS EXTRAORDINARY CAREER. "LISTEN, THIS TO ME WAS SO COMMON," A SMILING PELE TOLD AFP. "I SUFFERED ALL MY LIFE WITH GOOD MARKING.  IF YOURE AT THE CONFERENCE, BE SURE TO SEND ME A TWEET TO SAY HI. HE'S A VERY GOOD PLAYER, EVERYBODY KNOWS. "THIS WAS ONE MOMENT.  CALLED 'ART, LIFE, FOOTBALL', THE EXHIBITION AT LONDON'S HALCYON GALLERY FEATURES ARTWORKS DEPICTING MEMORABLE MOMENTS FROM PELE'S CAREER, INCLUDING A 1977 PORTRAIT BY POP ART PIONEER ANDY WARHOL.  SECOND, EVERY PROPOSED FIX GIVES OLDER PEOPLE A BREAK, BY FOCUSING TAX INCREASES OR BENEFIT CUTS ON YOUNGER GENERATIONS.  FOLLOWING HER WERE TEAMMATES EMILY TENNESON, RACHEL BAGBY, MYLA HAYES AND PRISCILLA CABALLERO. UNLIKE TODAY'S STARS, THERE IS NOT A SURFEIT OF FOOTAGE OF PELE IN ACTION, BUT SOME OF HIS GOALS WERE SO FAMOUS THEY ACQUIRED THEIR OWN EPITHETS. THERE WAS 'O MILESIMO', A PENALTY FOR SANTOS -- HIS ONLY BRAZILIAN CLUB -- AGAINST VASCO DA GAMA THAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE HIS 1,000TH GOAL. A PITCH-LONG DRIBBLE AND SHOT AGAINST FLUMINENSE IN 1961 WAS DEEMED WORTHY OF A PLAQUE AT RIO DE JANEIRO'S ICONIC MARACANA, THE GROUND WHERE IT WAS SCORED, EARNING IT THE NICKNAME 'GOL DE PLACA'. MEANWHILE, THE GOAL PELE CONSIDERED HIS BEST, IN WHICH HE REPUTEDLY FLICKED THE BALL OVER THREE DEFENDERS AND THE GOALKEEPER BEFORE HEADING IN DURING A MATCH AGAINST THE BRAZILIAN JUVENTUS IN 1959, WAS RECREATED USING CGI IN 2014. "PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEM UNTIL NOW BECAUSE THEY WERE SO GOOD," SAYS PELE -- FULL NAME EDSON ARANTES DO NASCIMENTO -- OF THE FLUMINENSE AND JUVENTUS GOALS, NEITHER OF WHICH WAS CAUGHT ON FILM. "OF COURSE I HAD OTHER GOALS THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO ME, IN A WORLD CUP TOO. BUT THESE TWO GOALS WERE THE ONES PEOPLE MENTIONED MORE. "THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL GOALS, BUT THERE WERE OTHER IMPORTANT GOALS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 1,000TH GOAL. "IT WAS A PENALTY KICK.  RELATED: HAWKS CONFIDENT HILL WILL SOAR | SIMPSON TO SHOW WHO'S BOSS GIVEN SYDNEY HAVE FOUR OF THEIR VERY BEST PLAYERS MISSING, AND FREMANTLE SHOULD DO THE JOB TOMORROW, THAT WOULD MOST LIKELY SET UP AN ALL-WEST AUSTRALIAN PRELIMINARY FINAL IN A FORTNIGHT. EVERYBODY SAID, 'OH, IT'S EASY TO SCORE A GOAL WITH A PENALTY KICK.' "BUT TO ME, IN THE MARACANA, I WAS SHAKING, I WAS SO NERVOUS. I SAID TO MYSELF, 'MY GOD, I CANNOT MISS THIS MOMENT.' THIS 1,000TH GOAL WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME TOO." PELE, WHO UNDERWENT SPINAL SURGERY IN JULY, CONSIDERS LIONEL MESSI TO BE THE WORLD'S BEST CURRENT PLAYER AND CITES ENGLAND'S 1966 WORLD CUP-WINNING MIDFIELDER BOBBY CHARLTON AS HIS "MOST DIFFICULT OPPONENT".  THE BARCELONA FORWARD, 23, HAS ALREADY SCORED 46 INTERNATIONAL GOALS AND HAS PELE'S MARK OF 77 IN HIS SIGHTS. BUT WITH NEYMAR HAVING STARTED OUT, LIKE PELE, AT SANTOS, THE THREE-TIME WORLD CUP-WINNER IS RELAXED ABOUT THE PROSPECT. "COINCIDENTALLY, NEYMAR IS FROM SANTOS. HE STARTED THERE," SAID PELE, WHO ALSO SPENT TWO YEARS AT NEW YORK COSMOS. "MY SON, EDINHO (SENTENCED LAST YEAR TO A 33-YEAR JAIL TERM FOR MONEY LAUNDERING), WHO WAS A GOALKEEPER, WAS HIS COACH IN THE UNDER-20S. IF NEYMAR BREAKS THIS RECORD, FANTASTIC. ONE MORE FOR SANTOS!" AS MUCH AS HE ENJOYS WATCHING NEYMAR AND MESSI STRUT THEIR STUFF, HOWEVER, PELE RESORTS TO AN OLD REFRAIN WHEN ASKED IF ANYONE IN THE MODERN GAME REMINDS HIM OF HIMSELF.  RICK PULLEN, A PSYCHIATRIST AT RIMROCK FOUNDATION AND AN ADDICTION SPECIALIST, SAID METH EVENTUALLY DAMAGES THE BRAINS ABILITY TO PRODUCE DOPAMINE. "I USED TO SAY: 'LISTEN, EVERYBODY WANTS TO FIND A NEW PELE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE,'" HE SAYS. "MY MOTHER AND MY FATHER CLOSED THE MACHINE. NO MORE!" FOLLOW TOI SPORTS ON TWITTER @TOISPORTSNEWS
31	ENGLEWOOD, COLO. (AP) STILL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS AND A RHYTHM ON OFFENSE, PEYTON MANNING AT LEAST FOUND HIS FUNNY BONE. THE BRONCOS PUZZLED PASSER MET THE MEDIA AT HIS LOCKER TUESDAY WITH A CAREFREE SMILE AND BOUNCED BACK FROM AN ICY POST-GAME PERFORMANCE THAT FOLLOWED THE BRONCOS 19-13 VICTORY OVER BALTIMORE, ONE THAT INCLUDED NONE OF THE USUAL OFFENSIVE FIREWORKS. HOUNDED FIRST BY THE BOO-BIRDS WHEN THE BRONCOS RAN JUST ONE RED ZONE PLAY AND THEN BY REPORTERS, MANNING WAS ACERBIC AFTER STRETCHING HIS STREAK TO 21 DRIVES, INCLUDING THE PRESEASON, WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN CELEBRATION. THIS TIME, HE DELIVERED A FEW FUNNY LINES AND DEFLECTED TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS STILL-EVOLVING OFFENSE OF BLENDED CONCEPTS WITH A TOUCH OF HUMOR. ASKED ABOUT LANDING ON THE INJURY REPORT WITH A SORE BACK COURTESY OF ALL THOSE HARD HITS FROM THE RAVENS, MANNING DECIDED TO DELIVER HIS OWN EVALUATION OF THOSE ASKING ALL THE QUESTIONS. THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY GROUP, BY ANY MEANS, MANNING CRACKED. THIS ONE SURELY HAS GOUT. BUNIONS, THAT ONE. CARPEL TUNNEL OVER HERE FROM ALL THE TEXTING OF HIS SOURCES. AND THE DRIVE-TIME RADIO HOST, HES GOT LARYNGITIS FROM RIPPING ME ALL WEEK PLUS THE RASH THAT HE HAS THATS UNIDENTIFIED. BUT I NEVER HEAR YOU GUYS COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, SO IM NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. IN MANY WAYS, YOU GUYS INSPIRE ME, MANNING DEAD-PANNED. BUT, NO, I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT I WAS ON IT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. BUT I THINK LIKE A LOT OF GUYS, IT WAS A PRETTY PHYSICAL GAME ON SUNDAY. AND JUST LIKE THAT, MANNING WENT FROM BEING THE THERMOMETER TO BEING THE THERMOSTAT, SETTING THE TONE FOR THE TEAM INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THE MOOD SURROUNDING IT. I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES AROUND HERE THAT WE DID ACTUALLY WIN THE GAME AND THAT WE ARE 1-0. THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE I CANT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE HAD WE LOST THE GAME, MANNING SAID. THE OFFENSE, WHICH INCLUDES FOUR NEW LINEMEN, DID DO SOME GOOD THINGS SUNDAY, LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER AN 11-MINUTE FOURTH-QUARTER DRIVE THAT LED TO BRANDON MCMANUSS FOURTH FIELD GOAL. IM SURE OFFENSIVELY I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF GUYS THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO PLAY BETTER. I FEEL LIKE THAT THURSDAY PROBABLY COULDNT COME SOON ENOUGH, MANNING SAID. THE BRONCOS PLAY AT KANSAS CITY (1-0), WHERE A VICTORY WOULD GIVE MANNING AND THE BRONCOS A RECORD 13TH CONSECUTIVE DIVISIONAL ROAD WIN. FIRST THINGS FIRST. FINDING THE END ZONE IS PRIORITY NO. 1 FOR A TEAM THAT JUST TWO YEARS AGO BECAME THE FIRST IN NFL HISTORY TO CRACK THE 600-POINT BARRIER WHEN MANNING THREW FOR A RECORD 55 TOUCHDOWNS. SOMETIMES THE BEST MEDICINE IS TO GET BACK OUT THERE AND PLAY AS SOON AS YOU CAN, MANNING SAID. AND, AS HE SHOWED TUESDAY, SOMETIMES LAUGHTERS THE BEST TONIC, TOO. NOTES: ILB BRANDON MARSHALL SAID ONE OF THE SCREWS IN HIS SURGICALLY REPAIRED RIGHT FOOT HAS BROKEN, BUT HELL TRY TO DEAL WITH THE DISCOMFORT UNTIL AFTER THE SEASON BECAUSE SURGERY TO REMOVE IT WOULD REQUIRE A TWO-MONTH RECOVERY. S DARIAN STEWART (GROIN) GOT HURT ON THE PLAY BEFORE HIS GAME-WINNING INTERCEPTION SUNDAY, SOMETHING COACH GARY KUBIAK DIDNT LEARN UNTIL WATCHING CB AQIB TALIB, WHO WAS MICD UP FOR THE GAME, ON THE TEAMS WEBSITE.

34	NEW YORK , SEPT. 30, 2015 /PRNEWSWIRE-USNEWSWIRE/ -- FLUORIDE ACTION NETWORK (FAN) HAS DELIVERED A 100-PAGE REPORT TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP ENTITLED "WATER FLUORIDATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE" OUTLINING THE DANGERS POSED BY THIS PRACTICE TO POOR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SINCE 1962 OFFICIALS AT THE U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE HAVE KNOWN THAT BLACKS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED BY FLUORIDE WITH HIGHER RATES OF DENTAL FLUOROSIS (PERMANENT DAMAGE TO THE ENAMEL) RATES COMPARED TO WHITES. BUT FOR OVER 40 YEARS THEY HID THIS INFORMATION FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IN RESPONSE TO A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST, FAN DISCOVERED THAT IN 2005, 58% OF BLACKS HAD DENTAL FLUOROSIS COMPARED TO 32% OF WHITES. THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT NO FEDERAL AGENCY ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFETY OF THIS PROGRAM. INSTEAD THE DIVISION OF ORAL HEALTH AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) HAS BECOME A "ROGUE ELEPHANT" BLINDLY PROMOTING FLUORIDATION, DENYING ANY HARM AND FAILING MISERABLY TO PROVIDE ANY WARNINGS TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OF THEIR VULNERABILITIES. THIS HAS PROMPTED CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS TO CALL FOR CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS. ACCORDING TO FAN'S DIRECTOR, PAUL CONNETT , PHD, "THE SITUATION HAS BECOME MUCH WORSE NOW THAT IT IS CLEAR THAT FLUORIDE IS AN ENDOCRINE DISRUPTOR AND IS NEUROTOXIC. THERE ARE 45 STUDIES THAT FLUORIDE AT MODEST LEVELS LOWERS IQ IN CHILDREN ( WWW.FLUORIDEACTION.NET/ISSUES/HEALTH/BRAIN )." IN 2015 THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES ANNOUNCED A LOWERING OF THE FLUORIDE LEVEL IN FLUORIDATION PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, EVEN AT THE NEW LEVEL OF 0.7 PPM, BOTTLE-FED INFANTS IN FLUORIDATED COMMUNITIES RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY 100 TIMES MORE FLUORIDE THAN A BREAST-FED INFANT. FAN IS SEEKING FROM THE MULTI-AGENCY GROUP SUPPORT FOR 5-STEP COMMUNITY-BASED PLAN (ALONG THE LINES OF PROGRAMS FROM SCOTLAND AND DENMARK ), WHICH NOT ONLY PROTECTS TEETH, BUT BY EMPHASIZING BETTER NUTRITION ESPECIALLY LOWERED SUGAR INTAKE - FIGHTS OBESITY AND IMPROVES THE OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF CHILDREN FROM POOR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WITHOUT FORCING THEM TO DRINK FLUORIDATED WATER. AS A FIRST STEP FAN URGED THE MULTI-AGENCY GROUP TO CALL UPON THE EPA'S OFFICE OF WATER TO DETERMINE A SAFE REFERENCE DOSE FOR FLUORIDE THAT WOULD PROTECT ALL CHILDREN INCLUDING THE MOST VULNERABLE - FROM A LOWERED IQ. SUCH A DETERMINATION WOULD MAKE ADDING FLUORIDE TO PUBLIC WATER UNTHINKABLE.

35	A GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY MEET ON TUESDAY, WHICH DISCUSSED THE SLOWDOWN IN CHINA AND PROPOSALS TO CONVERT THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRYS ECONOMIC WOES INTO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIA, WILL BE QUICKLY FOLLOWED UP WITH A HIGH-LEVEL COMMERCIAL DIALOGUE WITH CHINA NEXT WEEK. DURING THE SIX-DAY MEETING STARTING SEPTEMBER 14, THE OFFICIAL INDIAN SIDE LED BY COMMERCE SECRETARY RITA TEAOTIA IS EXPECTED TO TAKE UP CONCERNS OF THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY INCLUDING FEARS OF DUMPING FROM CHINESE COMPANIES FOLLOWING THE RECENT YUAN DEVALUATION, BESIDES THE TROUBLES FACED BY INDIAN COMPANIES IN GETTING GREATER MARKET ACCESS IN SECTORS SUCH AS IT/ITES, PHARMACEUTICALS AND FARM PRODUCTS. INDIA WANTS CHINA TO ENSURE GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND SIMPLIFICATION REGARDING PROCEDURES CONCERNING INSPECTION, REGISTRATION AND CLEARANCES OF INDIAN IMPORTS. CITING INDIAS BURGEONING TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA, NEW DELHI IS ALSO LIKELY TO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE CHINA TO OFFSET THIS TRADE IMBALANCE BY INVESTING IN THE NARENDRA MODI GOVERNMENTS MAKE IN INDIA INITIATIVE. INDIA IS LOOKING TO PUSH CHINA TO KEEP ITS WORD ON THE PROMISE IT MADE LAST SEPTEMBER (DURING CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPINGS INDIA VISIT) TO INVEST $20 BILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, INCLUDING IN INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN INDIA. A BUSINESS DELEGATION IS ALSO LIKELY TO JOIN THE OFFICIAL DELEGATION TO EXPLORE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA AND TO FORGE JOINT VENTURES IN FIELDS SUCH AS PROJECT EXPORTS. INDIAS TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA HAD HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH OF $48.5 BILLION IN FY15 (OR FOUR TIMES INDIAS EXPORTS TO CHINA IN THE FISCAL) FROM JUST $1.1 BILLION IN FY04. IN APRIL-JUNE FY16, THE TRADE DEFICIT HAS ALREADY TOUCHED $12.3 BILLION. ON THE OTHER HAND, TOTAL FDI INFLOWS FROM CHINA TO INDIA DURING APRIL 2000-JUNE 2015 WERE JUST $1.1 BILLION (OR A MINUSCULE 0.4% OF THE TOTAL $258 BILLION WORTH TOTAL FDI INFLOWS INTO INDIA DURING THE 15-YEAR PERIOD), FAR BELOW POTENTIAL. OTHER ISSUES THAT COULD COME UP FOR DISCUSSION INCLUDE COMPLAINTS FROM INDIAN EXPORTERS AGAINST SPURIOUS DRUGS MADE IN CHINA, BRANDED WRONGLY AS INDIAN AND SOLD IN OVERSEAS MARKETS TO DAMAGE THE REPUTATION OF INDIAN DRUG COMPANIES. CHINA HAD ASSURED TO INVEST AND DEVELOP TWO MEGA INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN GUJARAT AND MAHARASHTRA, BESIDES INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN INDIA. HOWEVER, DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING THE REQUIRED LAND FOR THESE INDUSTRIAL PARKS HAS BEEN THE CAUSE FOR DELAY, SOURCES SAID. THE INDUSTRIAL PARKS WERE MEANT TO MANUFACTURE ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, POWER EQUIPMENT, INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY, APPAREL, ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS AND FOOTWEAR, BESIDES OTHER VALUE-ADDED ITEMS. THEY WERE THEN TO BE EXPORTED TO CHINA AND OTHER MARKETS TO BOOST INDIAS EXPORTS AND AT THE SAME TIME REDUCE THE TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA. ALSO, DESPITE PROMISES AT THE HIGHEST POLITICAL LEVELS ON REMOVING BARRIERS TO ENABLE INDIAN COMPANIES ESPECIALLY IN SECTORS THAT MATTERS MOST TO INDIA (INCLUDING PHARMA, IT/ITES, FARM PRODUCTS, MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT, AND AUTO COMPONENTS) GET BETTER MARKET ACCESS, THERE WAS NOT MUCH RESPONSE FROM THE GROUND-LEVEL AUTHORITIES IN CHINA TO REMOVE THESE OBSTACLES, SOURCES SAID. EXPORTERS HAD SAID THE YUAN DEVALUATION WILL NOT ONLY AFFECT INDIAS IMPORTS FROM CHINA (AS THEIR REALISATION WILL BE LESSER) BUT ALSO MAKE CHINESE PRODUCTS MORE COMPETITIVE THAN COMPETING INDIAN ITEMS SUCH AS MANMADE FIBRES, GARMENTS, GEMS AND JEWELLERY, STEEL AND ORGANIC CHEMICALS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET, FURTHER HITTING INDIAS OVERALL EXPORTS.

36	AS A RIDER TO THE PRESS RELEASE BY THE GOVERNOR OF GOMBE STATE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE 19 NORTHERN GOVERNORS FORUM ALHAJI KASHIM SHETTIMA LAMENTING ON HOW THE NORTH IS DRAGGING THE REST OF THE ENTITY CALLED NIGERIA BACKWARDS, I PRESENT THIS PEACE OF HISTORY TO SHOW THAT THE NORTH IS NOTHING BUT A DOG IN THE MANGER TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND A VERY STRONG CASE FOR BIAFRAS SELF DETERMINATION QUEST. THE REASON FOR THE DECISION OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO AMALGAMATE THE TWO INCOMPATIBLE TERRITORIES WAS PURELY FINANCIAL OR ECONOMIC. THE NORTHERN PROTECTORATE WAS NOT ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. IT HAD BECOME A GREAT DRAIN ON THE BRITISH TAX PAYER. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SOUTHERN PROTECTORATE WAS NOT JUST ECONOMICALLY BUOYANT, IT WAS PRODUCING SURPLUSES EVERY YEAR. THE BRITISH DESIGN WAS, THEREFORE, TO REMOVE THE NORTHERN FINANCIAL BURDEN FROM ITS OWN NECK AND HANG IT ON THE NECK OF THE HAPLESS SOUTHERN PROTECTORATE; ACCORDING TO LORD HARCOURT, THE BRITISH COLONIAL SECRETARY, UNIFICATION OF NIGERIA DEMANDED BOTH METHOD AND A MAN. THE MAN WAS TO BE LORD LUGARD AND THE METHOD WAS TO BE THE MARRIAGE OF THE TWO ENTITIES. ACCORDING TO LORD HARCOURT: WE HAVE RELEASED NORTHERN NIGERIA FROM THE LEADING STRINGS OF THE TREASURY. THE PROMISING AND WELL CONDUCTED YOUTH IS NOW ON AN ALLOWANCE ON HIS OWN AND IS ABOUT TO EFFECT AN ALLIANCE WITH A SOUTHERN LADY OF MEANS. I HAVE ISSUED THE SPECIAL LICENSE AND SIR FREDERICK LUGARD WILL PERFORM THE CEREMONY. MAY THE UNION BE FRUITFUL AND THE COUPLE CONSTANT. THUS, IN THIS MARRIAGE, THE NORTH, RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, WAS TO BE MAN AND HUSBAND NIGERIA AND THE SOUTH, THE WOMAN AND WIFE. THE USE OF THE TERM, YOUTH (MAN) FOR THE NORTH AND LADY (WOMAN) FOR THE SOUTH WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT, NOR AN EXERCISE IN HUMOUR. IT WAS A DEADLY SERIOUS MATTER, WITH THE GAME PLAN BEING TO BRING THE TWO PARTIES TOGETHER IN ORDER TO GIVE THE NORTH POLITICAL POWER OVER THE SOUTH AND PERMANENT CONTROL OVER SOUTHERN RESOURCES. IN THE ENGLAND OF THE TIME OF LORD HARCOURT, MARRIED WOMAN HAD NO INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE OUTSIDE THEIR MARRIAGE. ALL THE WOMENS PROPERTY AND RESOURCES AUTOMATICALLY BECAME THE HUSBANDS. THE WOMAN COULD NOT ENTER INTO A CONTRACT IN HER OWN RIGHT. HER HUSBAND HAD TO CONCLUDE ALL HER CONTRACTS ON HER BEHALF. ALTHOUGH THIS POSITION ALTERED BY THE MARRIED WOMENS PROPERTY ACT OF 1882, LORD HARCOURT HAD THE COMMON LAW POSITION IN MIND WHEN HE DECIDED TO MARRY THE YOUNG MAN WITHOUT MEANS, TO THE YOUNG LADY OF MEANS. THAT LATTER WAS TO PROVIDE THE WHEREWITHAL FOR THE FORMER TO LIVE WELL AND BE MASTER OF THE HOUSE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. OMO OMORUYI HAS LAMENTED AS FOLLOWS, REGARDING THE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES OF THIS MARRIAGE ON THE SOUTHERN LADY OF MEANS: TODAY, THE SOUTHERN LADY OF MEANS IS RICHER AND THE BRIDEGROOM THE WELL CONDUCTED YOUTH FROM THE NORTH IS POORER AND POORER OVER THE YEARS, A SITUATION NOT EVEN ANTICIPATED IN 1914. HENCE THE HUSBAND IN THE TYPICAL NIGERIAN FASHION WOULD ENSURE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS MAINTAINED AT ALL COST, EVEN IF IT MEANS KILLING THE BRIDE IN ORDER TO TAKE OVER HER WEALTH. THIS IS THE SITUATION THE OIL PRODUCING PART OF THE SOUTH FINDS ITSELF IN TODAY. ACCORDING TO ALHAJI GAMBO JIMETA, THE NORTH (HUSBAND) WILL GO TO WAR OVER OIL. THE NORTHERN POLITICIANS UNDERSTOOD THE PLAN PERFECTLY AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED IT FAITHFULLY AND FERVENTLY SINCE THEN. THEY ARE WELL FOCUSED ON HOW TO CLING TO POWER, FOR THEY KNOW THAT THAT IS THE ROUTE TO SOUTHERN RESOURCES. HOW HAVE THEY RETAINED POWER? THE FORMULA HAS BEEN AN AMAZINGLY SIMPLE ONE: CONTROL OF THE ARMY AND MANIPULATION OF THE CENSUS FIGURES. ALL THIS, COMBINED WITH HELP FROM BRITISH ADMINISTRATORS OF NIGERIA RIGHT UP TILL INDEPENDENCE, HAVE ASSURED THE NORTH OF PERMANENT POLITICAL POWER AND CONTROL OF SOUTHERN RESOURCES. BRITISH MANIPULATION OF ACCESS TO POWER HAVING INSTALLED THE NORTH AS HUSBAND OF THE SOUTH AND MASTER OF NIGERIA IN 1914, THE BRITISH COLONIAL MASTER DID NOT LET MATTERS REST THERE. AT EVERY STAGE THEY ENSURED THAT THE REINS OF POWER WOULD REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF THEIR BELOVED PROTEGES. IT WILL BE RECALLED THAT AT THE 1950 NATIONAL CONFERENCE, THE NORTH DEMANDED AT LEAST 50 PER CENT OF THE SEATS IN THE CENTRAL LEGISLATURE, AS A CONDITION FOR BEING PART OF NIGERIA. THAT DEMAND WAS BASED ON THE CENSUS FIGURES THAT HAD BEEN RIGGED IN THEIR FAVOUR. MASTERS QUICKLY GRANTED THE NORTHERN DEMAND AND DISTRIBUTED THE SEATS IN FAVOR OF THE NORTH. BY : M.M.MBANAJA

THE RADIUS IS TO KEEP THE AUDIENCE SAFE FROM THE BIG AND FLASHY MOVES, SUCH AS THE 8- AND 10-FOOT FLAMES SHOT FROM HIS MOTORCYCLE, THE 30- AND 40-FOOT CURLS STEMMING FROM HIS FLAMETHROWER AND TO KEEP THEM A REASONABLE DISTANCE FROM THE TALL FLAMES HE BREATHES. TORCH ALSO USES AN ARRAY OF NUNCHUCKS, A BULLWHIP AND A FIRE STAFF (THAT LOOKS LIKE A BATON) TO SPIN, CRACK AND WIELD FIRE IN CIRCLES, ARCS AND OTHER SHAPES. "WHEN YOU SAY 'FIRE SHOW,' YOU PICTURE SOMEONE DOING A VERY SLOW PACE," TORCH SAYS. "MOST [FIRE PERFORMERS] ARE WEIRD LOOKING DUDES TRYING TO LOOK SEXY [WHILE PERFORMING]. THEY HAVE THEIR SHIRT OFF AND HAVE LONG HAIR OR HAVE GIRLS IN HULA HOOPS. "A LOT OF THE FIRE PERFORMERS DO ONE THING AT A SLOW PACE AND CAN DRAG IT OUT FOR 5 OR 10 MINUTES." BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU GET WITH HIS SHOW, BECAUSE HE'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE FIRE PERFORMER. "MINE HAS LOTS OF ENERGY, WORKING THE CROWD AND GETTING LOTS OF ENERGY GOING," HE SAYS. "IT'S MORE IN-YOUR-FACE ... TO GET THE WHOLE CROWD'S ATTENTION." RATHER THAN A BIG, LONG SET, TORCH WILL DO VARIOUS ACTS, USUALLY AT 30 SECONDS TO A MINUTE EACH. ONCE SOMETHING STOPS BEING INTERESTING, HE STOPS DOING IT. HE FEEDS ON THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CROWD AND EXERTS SO MUCH ENERGY WITH EACH PERFORMANCE THAT HE USUALLY FEELS SICK AFTERWARD, FROM ALL THE EFFORT SPENT AND THE HIGH DEMAND IT PUTS ON HIS BODY. WHILE DOING A SHOW, "TO PUMP UP ENERGY, I'LL BE RUNNING AROUND LIKE A MANIAC," HE SAYS. BUT THE TECHNIQUE OF EATING FIRE TAKES DISCIPLINE, INCLUDING HIGH CONTROL OF HIS BREATHING. GOING FULL THROTTLE TO AN INSTANT STOP MEANS A LOT OF PRACTICE. TORCH GOT HIS START IN 2009 WHEN HE LEARNED HOW TO USE BASIC FIRE PERFORMING EQUIPMENT FROM A FIRE-EATING GO-GO DANCER AT A DALLAS NIGHTCLUB, WHERE HE WORKED. AFTER A FEW 10- AND 15-MINUTE TEACHING SESSIONS, HE BOUGHT HIS OWN EQUIPMENT AND PERFORMED A COUPLE TIMES A NIGHT SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK. HE STARTED TOURING IN 2012 AND ENJOYS STAYING ON THE ROAD. IT KEEPS HIM CLOSE TO NATURE, GIVES HIM A WAY TO SEE THE COUNTRY AND INTRODUCES HIM TO WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A STELLAR GROUP OF PEOPLE. "ABOVE ALL, I'M A BIKER," HE SAYS ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE. "I LOVE MY BIKER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND WHAT WE REPRESENT, WHICH IS GREAT CAUSES." IT INFLUENCES THE VENUES HE PICKS FOR PERFORMANCE, WHICH INCLUDE PLENTY OF BIKER RALLIES. "YOU BECOME FAMILY WITH A LOT OF [PEOPLE] AT THESE RALLIES," HE SAYS. "BIKERS ARE A CLOSE KNIT GROUP OF PEOPLE. A LOT GOES INTO THESE RALLIES [INCLUDING] A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE."

MILITARY VEHICLE FANS WERE INVITED TO THE CHURCH TO GET AN UP-CLOSE-AND-PERSONAL LOOK AT THE REFURBISHED AND UNIQUE VEHICLES.VILLA RICA MAYOR J. COLLINS ADDRESSED THE CROWD, SAYING HIS CITY WAS PROUD TO HOST THE GROUP. DOESNT IT SAY A LOT ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE CAN GATHER HERE AT THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF VILLA RICA AND CELEBRATE OUR COUNTRY, HE SAID. ITS A NIGHT THAT WERE THANKFUL TO BE VILLA RICANS, WERE THANKFUL TO BE AMERICANS AND WERE THANKFUL FOR THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH AND THEIR GRACIOUS HOSPITALITY HERE.THE CHURCHS PASTOR, KEVIN WILLIAMS, WHO IS ALSO A VETERAN OF THE MILITARY POLICE, SAID HE WAS AMAZED AT THE SIZE OF THE CROWD. IM PROUD WE COULD HAVE THEM HERE, HE SAID. WILLIAMS AND VOLUNTEERS AT THE CHURCH HANDED OUT BIBLES WITH A LETTER INSIDE, DATED JAN. 25, 1941, FROM PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT.I TAKE GREAT PLEASURE IN COMMENDING THE READING OF THE BIBLE TO ALL WHO SERVE IN THE ARMED FORCES, THE LETTER READS.THE TRIP THROUGH VILLA RICA RETRACED THE APPROXIMATE ROUTE TAKEN BY THE U.S. ARMY IN ITS 1920 TRANSCONTINENTAL MOTOR CONVOY, TRAVELING FROM WASHINGTON TO SAN DIEGO ALONG THE BANKHEAD HIGHWAY.THE CONVOY ARRIVED IN VILLA RICA AT ABOUT 6:30 P.M.

THE 1920 ROUTE BEGAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND ENDED AT BALBOA PARK, IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, 116 DAYS LATER.
39	HEY ALL! MY NAME IS PLUTO. I AM A PUPPY MILL RESCUE. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ME FROM MY DAILY CORGI DEBUT BACK IN MAY. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK! THE GOOD NEWS? I AM ADJUSTING TO LIFE ON THE OUTSIDE. AND THERE IS ICE CREAM HERE. ICE CREAM, PEOPLE. CAN YOU DIG IT? MY LIFE HAS BEEN BUSY AND INTENSE THESE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, AS I SET NEW BOUNDARIES AND GROW MORE RELAXED WITH MY NEW FAMILY AND HUMANS IN GENERAL. THEY SAY I'M "VERY VOCAL". SURE, I BARK AT STRANGERS. WHO DOESN'T? I BARK AT MY HUMANS, BUT THEY PLAY THE BARKING GAME TOO. LITTLE BARKS BACK AND FORTH. I PULL OUT MY CUTE HOWL, BUT LOSE MY VOICE HALF WAY THROUGH EVERY TIME, FINISHING WITH A SILENT HOWLING POSE. A GUY HAS TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD AND SEEN, AFTER ALL. I'M NOT UP FOR A LOT OF PLAY, EXCEPT FOR FIRST OUTSIDE TRIPS IN THE MORNING AND AT NIGHT. WE DO LAPS TOGETHER, BUT AT SOME POINT I'M NOT SURE WHETHER WE'RE PLAYING OR CHASING, AND I DON'T LIKE BEING CHASED. IT GETS CONFUSING! THIS IS ME BEING CONFUSED. ALTHOUGH I PREFER THE CLOSE CONFINES OF MY KENNEL, WHERE I CAN SHRED TISSUES AND HOARD MY COLLECTED OBJECTS D'ART INTO A PILE, I ENJOY HANGING WITH THE PACK AFTER WALKS, EATING, OR PLAYING OUTSIDE. HERE AND THERE DURING THE DAY, THE UPRIGHTS PICK ME UP AND HOLD ME. I RELAX PRETTY FAST AND HAVE EVEN FALLEN ASLEEP ON A FEW LAPS. NAP LAPS ROCK. I AM BRAVEST WHEN OUT AND ABOUT. "IRRESISTIBLE" THEY EXCLAIM. I'M SHY, BUT I'LL SNIFF HANDS AND EVEN LET THE NICE ONES PET ME. AS I SAY, IRRESISTIBLE. NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT THAT. IT'S GREAT FUN STOPPING TO SMELL EVERY ROSE AND GREET EVERY DOG. I MANAGE CROWDED SIDEWALKS VERY WELL, STAYING RIGHT AT MY HEEL IN CROWDS. I HAVE GRACED SEVERAL OUTDOOR PATIOS AND DOG FRIENDLY STORES, WHERE A GOOD TIME WAS HAD BY ALL. GETTING MY CHILLAX ON AT HIGHLAND GRILL. MY FOLKS RECENTLY TOOK ME TO A LARGE FAMILY BIRTHDAY PARTY (19 PEOPLE, 5 DOGS, 2 CATS), WHERE I MET SEVERAL OF NIECES AND NEPHEWS AND 3 OTHER DOGS MORE MY SIZE. DESPITE THE RAUCOUS ATMOSPHERE (FOOTBALL, BOARD GAMES, LOUD CONVERSATIONS, FOOD) I DID GREAT, DARTING ABOUT THE ROOM BY MYSELF AND WITH THE OTHER DOGS. I LAID WITH AUNT TESSA AND COUSIN EMILIA (MINI HUMAN AT SIX YEARS OLD) FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE AGES. I'M PRETTY I MIGHT ALSO HAVE DOZED OFF IN THE LAP OF A STRANGER! LET IT BE NOTED FOR THE RECORD: I LOSE ALL ANXIETY IN THE PRESENCE OF HARD SALAMI, VENISON JERKY, AND GOLDFISH CRACKERS. YES, SALAMI. IS THERE SALAMI FLAVORED ICE CREAM YET? HUMANS, GET CRACKIN'! IT'S HIGH TIME THAT DELI MEATS AND ICE CREAM GOT TOGETHER, DON'T YOU THINK? AM I REALLY THE FIRST ONE TO SUGGEST THIS? I'VE LET ON THAT I UNDERSTAND OUTSIDE, DINNER/EAT, AND GO/WALK. IN FACT, I GET VISIBLY EXCITED WHEN THEY LET THE MAGIC WORDS SLIP. AS FOR THE GREAT METAL BEAST (CAR), GETTING IN AND OUT OF THAT WAS HARD AT THE START, BUT NOW IT'S A NO-STRESS HOP IN AND OUT. I ENJOY STANDING ON MY BACK LEGS AND LOOKING OUT THE REAR WINDOW. DON'T WE ALL? AT MINNEHAHA FALLS PARK, I FOLLOWED MY BRO CARNOT INTO THE CREEK. DIDNT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF CREEK WATER. SWAM AGAINST THE CURRENT AND DID A BIT OF ROCK HOPPING BEFORE CHILLING OUT IN THE SHALLOW END. I THOUGHT I'D HAD ENOUGH, BUT LATER DURING THE PARK WALK I PLUNGED INTO THE CREEK AGAIN! WHO KNEW? LIKE CARNOT, I PREFER REAL WATER OVER BATH WATER. MUST BE THE WHOLE CALL OF THE WILD THING, WOLF WITHIN AND ALL OF THAT STUFF. NOW. ABOUT THAT SALAMI ICE CREAM
40	SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- (MARKETWIRED) -- 09/08/15 -- " EARLOBE REPAIR IS A POPULAR PROCEDURE AMONG BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AT MY PRACTICE," STATES SAN FRANCISCO PLASTIC SURGEON KAREN HORTON, MD . "WOMEN USUALLY WISH TO ADDRESS STRETCHED OUT EAR PIERCINGS OR TORN EARLOBES, AND MEN OFTEN WANT TO CORRECT SIZEABLE HOLES RESULTING FROM LARGE DISCS -- KNOWN AS GAUGES -- INSERTED IN THEIR EARLOBES THAT WERE ONCE DESIRED BUT NO LONGER FIT WITH THEIR CURRENT LOOK. IN ADDITION TO THESE CONCERNS, MANY MEN AND WOMEN ALSO SEE ME FOR KELOID SCARS IN THE EARS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED FROM PAST PIERCINGS, INFECTIONS, OR TRAUMA." FOR INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN EARLOBE REPAIR, DR. HORTON SAYS SHE FIRST OBTAINS A COMPLETE MEDICAL HISTORY AND CONDUCTS A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE TARGETED AREA DURING AN INITIAL CONSULTATION. SHOULD SHE DETERMINE THAT EARLOBE CORRECTION SURGERY WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OPTION FOR THE PATIENT'S UNIQUE NEEDS -- AS OPPOSED TO NONSURGICAL EARLOBE REJUVENATION VIA FILLERS -- THE PROCEDURE IS DISCUSSED IN EXTENSIVE DETAIL, AND A SURGICAL DATE IS SCHEDULED IF THE PATIENT WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED. ON THE DAY OF SURGERY, THE SAN FRANCISCO PLASTIC SURGEON NOTES THAT THE TREATMENT AREA IS MARKED, AND THE PATIENT VISUALLY CONFIRMS WHAT IS TO BE PERFORMED. NEXT, LOCAL ANESTHESIA IS ADMINISTERED, AND THE PROCEDURE IS CONDUCTED UNDER MAGNIFICATION TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF ACCURACY AND PRECISION. "DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION," DR. HORTON WRITES IN A RECENT BLOG POST OVERVIEWING EARLOBE REPAIR , "EXCESS SCARRING, SKIN, OR TISSUE IS REMOVED, AND THE REMAINING EARLOBE TISSUE IS 'LOCALLY REARRANGED' TO CREATE A MORE NORMAL APPEARING EARLOBE." IF A PIERCING IS STILL DESIRED AFTER THE OPERATION, THE EARLOBE CAN ALSO BE RE-PIERCED AT THE TIME OF SURGERY. IN REGARD TO RECOVERY FROM EARLOBE REPAIR , DR. HORTON EXPLAINS THAT SOME TEMPORARY SWELLING AND/OR BRUISING CAN BE EXPECTED INITIALLY, BUT THESE SIDE EFFECTS SHOULD DIMINISH RELATIVELY QUICKLY. "DOWNTIME IS TYPICALLY MINIMAL, WITH MOST INDIVIDUALS RETURNING TO WORK AND/OR NORMAL DAILY ROUTINES THE DAY AFTER THEIR PROCEDURE. THAT SAID, PATIENTS ARE ADVISED TO AVOID STRENUOUS ACTIVITIES AND RIGOROUS EXERCISE FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE TO TWO WEEKS IN ORDER TO HELP ENSURE PROPER HEALING." ULTIMATELY, WHEN PERFORMED BY AN EXPERIENCED BOARD CERTIFIED PLASTIC SURGEON, DR. HORTON STATES THAT EARLOBE REPAIR CAN BE AN EXCEPTIONALLY GRATIFYING PROCEDURE FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS, ENABLING THEM TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR EARLOBES. ABOUT KAREN HORTON, MD CERTIFIED BY THE AMERICAN BOARD OF PLASTIC SURGERY, DR. HORTON OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF COSMETIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE PROCEDURES FOR THE BREASTS, FACE, AND BODY, AS WELL AS SEVERAL NONSURGICAL SKIN CARE AND MED-SPA TREATMENTS. SHE IS A FELLOW OF BOTH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS AND THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS OF CANADA, AND SHE REMAINS ACTIVE IN THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS, THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS, AND VARIOUS OTHER PRESTIGIOUS MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS.

42	MY OWN NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING BLOG POST/ARTICLE: "EASIER" IS THE WORD SHE IS CONTEMPLATING HERE. DOES LOSING A CHILD OR A MUCH WANTED PREGNANCY GET EASIER? I AGREE WITH "NO". IT GETS BEARABLE. THAT IS THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE ALMOST 4 YEARS OUT. THE DEFINITION OF BEARABLE IS: ABLE TO BE ENDURED, TOLERABLE. IT DIDN'T USED TO FEEL BEARABLE. I WOULD SAY THE GRIEF BECAME BEARABLE SOMETIME BETWEEN YEAR 1 AND 2. BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALL ACTIVE GRIEF. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS I WAS UTTERLY LOST AND CONSUMED BY THE LOSS OF MICHAEL AND ALENA - HAPPINESS FELT PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE. AT 3-6 MONTHS I WAS GETTING INTO THE TERRITORY OF WANTING HAPPINESS AGAIN; OF WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HEAVIEST KIND OF GRIEF WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND I BEGAN FEELING THE NEED TO PARENT MY LOST BABIES THROUGH ACTS. FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR, I WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO HEAL AND FIND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY. GRIEF AT THIS STAGE WAS CONSUMING, BUT NOT ALL-CONSUMING. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS A "NORMAL" PERSON AT ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME. AT THIS POINT IN MY JOURNEY AS A BEREAVED MOTHER, I WOULD SAY MOST WOULD CONSIDER ME A NORMAL, HAPPY, FUNCTIONING MOTHER/WIFE/WOMAN ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. MEANING, I GET ON WITH LIFE, TRYING TO ENJOY EVERYTHING I CAN, WHILE HONORING MY BABIES AND GIVING IN TO THE GRIEF WHEN NECESSARY. THINGS ARE BEARABLE. I'LL NEVER BE AT 100% AGAIN - THERE IS TOO MUCH SCARRING. BUT I WORK EVERY DAY TO GET JUST ONE MORE PERCENT HEALED. MY SKIN IS THICKER AND FOR 11 MONTHS OF THE 12 PER YEAR, I AM SMILING AND ABLE TO GET ON WITH IT. THAT SINGLE MONTH IS VERY NEAR. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BODY...THE NEARING OF OCTOBER. I CAN FEEL THEIR BIRTHDAY APPROACHING; CAN ALMOST HEAR IT, TOUCH IT, SMELL IT. THE LEAVES BEGINNING TO TURN AND THE COOL MORNINGS ARE INDICATORS THAT THE MONTH OF MEMORIES SWIMS NEARER TO ME. I WELCOME THE MEMORIES OF THE TWO BEINGS I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING UP TILL THAT POINT, BUT ALSO SHRINK BACK IN PAIN. THIS WILL BE THE MONTH (ALSO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS), THAT I HAVE TO RELIVE MY KIDS DYING. IT'S THE MONTH I HAVE TO REMEMBER GIVING BIRTH, WHILE TEARS OF HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FALL DOWN MY FACE. IT'S FREAKING PAINFUL. BUT, IT'S BEARABLE. AND I WILL GET THROUGH IT JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, KEEP READING. I LOVED THE WAY THIS WRITER EXPRESSED LIFE AS A BEREAVED PARENT. *COPIED FROM STILL STANDING MAGAZINE* A QUESTION IM FREQUENTLY ASKED BY BEREAVED PARENTS IS, DOES ITEVERGET EASIER? THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES IS PALPABLE. I KNOW. I GET IT. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION STILL SCARES ME TOO BECAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EASIER FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT. AND IT WASNT LONG AGO THAT I WAS ASKING BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WERE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF GRIEF THAN I WAS THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. IM NOT SURE WHEN I STOPPED ASKING IT PROBABLY WHEN I REALIZED IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN. STRADDLING HEAVEN AND EARTH ISNT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE ASEASY. EASIERIS A TRICKY WORD WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING AS PERMANENTLY HORRIFIC AS CHILD LOSS. I LIKE TO RESERVE THE WORDEASIERFOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING A NEW SKILL OVER TIME. EASIER IS A NICE LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEMEASURED.ITS ALSO A LOVELY LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT ARENT IRRETRIEVABLY LOST AND PERMANENTLY MISSING. FOREVER AND EVER. IM CERTAIN THE PROGRESS OF MOVING THROUGH THE UNCHARTED WATERS OF GRIEF AFTER THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS IMMEASURABLE. ITS ONE STEP FORWARD, FOUR STEPS BACK. ITS TREADING WATER, WITH YOUR HEAD SLIGHTLY ABOVE, UNTIL YOURE NOT. ITS SWIMMING ALONG, THEN DROWNING WITHOUT NOTICE. ITS NOT LINEAR. I WILL REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT GRIEF. WHETHER IN A DAY, A YEAR, OR A LIFETIME GRIEF ISNOTLINEAR. EVEN STILL, SEVEN YEARS LATER, I THINK IM SAILING ALONGOK,THEN ALL OF A SUDDENSMACKOUT OF NOWHERE GRIEF BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. SOMETIMES IT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF A STRATEGICALLY PLACED GORGEOUS NINE YEAR OLD, BLUE-EYED LITTLE BOY WHO SHOULD BE MY LIVING BREATHING OLDEST SON, BUT WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER MOTHER WHO IS CALLING AFTER HIM; SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM THE MISSING PUZZLE PIECE OF MY HEART THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF MY SON THAT STARTS OOZING UNCONTROLLABLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND TEARS LEAK OUT OF MY EYES WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. SOMETIMES ITS THE SIMPLE, ALMOST-PERFECT MOMENTS WITH MY 2/3RDS CHILDREN, THAT SMACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD AND ROB MY LUNGS OF PROPER BREATH. BREATHE,I GASP.BREATHE. THE THING ABOUT LIFE AFTER LOSS IS THAT NO MATTER WHATSOMEONE IS ALWAYS MISSING.NO MATTER WHAT, MY FAMILY IS ALWAYS ACHINGLYINCOMPLETE.I COULD HAVE FOUR MORE CHILDREN, AND THESE FACTS WOULD STILL REMAIN, STARING ME DOWN LIKE A CRUEL BULLY WHO WILL TORMENT ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT BACK. THE REALITY OF CHILD LOSS IS THAT THE WRONG CAN NEVER BE MADE RIGHT. IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED. EVER. LIFE IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN WITHOUT OUR LIVING, BREATHING CHILD(REN) IN IT. LIFE WILL NEVER FEEL A-OKAY AGAIN. SURE IT WILL HAVE MOMENTS OF BITTERSWEET JOY, AND BITTERSWEET HAPPINESS, AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LAUGH AGAIN, AND FIND STUPID THINGS FUNNY, BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE WHAT ITONCE WAS. THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THAT TWITTERPATED FEELING OF HAPPINESS THE KIND THAT FEELS NAIVE NOW, THE KIND YOU WONDER IF EVER EXISTED AT ALL? YOU MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. YOU CANT FIX IT, MEND IT, OR EVEN CRY IT AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS GO BY,THE ACHE REMAINS. SO BACK TOTHEQUESTION DOES IT EVER GET EASIER? THE HARD TRUTH IS A RESOUNDINGNO. NOT FOR ME, ANYWAY. IT HASNT GOTTENEASIERTO LIVE WITHOUT A HUGE PIECE OF MY HEART. GRIEF IS ALWAYS THERE, LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WALK THIS EARTH WITHOUT MY SON. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO BREATHE WHILE CHOKING ON AIR. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE NORMAL ANSWERS TO NORMAL QUESTIONS ANYMORE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS LIVING IN THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, SOUND LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OF GRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN HARD. WHETHER YOURE A DAY IN, OR 20 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO HARD. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD, OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION. SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD. AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE CAN HONOR OUR PRECIOUS CHILD WITH EVERY BREATH WE TAKE. WE CAN AND WILL BE HAPPY AGAINANDIM GUESSING IT WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS FEEL DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT OUR CHILD. WE LIVEANDWE GRIEVE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER, IT JUST BECOMESDIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT CALL THAT PESSIMISM, BUT FOR ME, ITSTRUTH. ITS SIMPLY THE REALITY OF BEREAVED PARENTHOOD. NOTE: GRIEF IS AS UNIQUE AS EACH PERSONS FINGERPRINT. IVE MET PLENTY OF BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WOULD SAY A RESOUNDING YES, GRIEF DOES GET EASIER OVER TIME. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR THEM. EASIER JUST ISNT THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. EACH PERSONS EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT. NO TWO PEOPLE GRIEVE THE SAME. AND OUR JOB IS TO MEET EVERYONES EXPERIENCE/REALITY WITH UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT AND LOVE.

43	IT TURNS OUT MOST MALES DONT CARE ABOUT A WOMANS SENSE OF HUMOR, ACCORDING TO A SEPT. 4 VICE ARTICLE . SO LADIES, STOP TRYING TO MAKE THE AVERAGE GUY LAUGH. YOURE FUNNY, BUT ITS USUALLY A WASTE OF BREATH. CITING A RECENT STUDY FROM THE JOURNAL EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY TITLED SEXUAL SELECTION AND HUMOR IN COURTSHIP: A CASE FOR WARMTH AND EXTROVERSION, VICE POINTS OUT THAT WOMEN FIND HUMOROUS DUDES MORE ATTRACTIVE. MEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, DONT NOTICE A WOMANS ABILITY TO MAKE THEM GIGGLE. WHEN A WOMAN CAN UNDERSTAND A JOKE, IT MAKES THEM MORE AFFABLE AND COOL, THE STUDY NOTES. FOR THE TYPICAL ALPHA MALE, THE GIRL WHO CAN BE AN AUDIENCE TO HIS FLEDGLING STAND-UP ROUTINE IS USUALLY THE MOST ATTRACTIVE CANDIDATE. FOR THE STUDY, A GROUP OF 102 HETEROSEXUAL FEMALES AND MALES WERE PUT INTO PAIRS FOR BLIND DATES. USING PROMPTS, THE COUPLES WERE ASKED TO STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION AND RANK THEIR INTEREST IN EACH OTHER AFTER 10 MINUTES. WHEN THE DATES WERE OVER, RESEARCHERS REVIEWED VIDEOS OF THE INTERACTIONS AND LOOKED FOR HUMOR. ALTHOUGH MEN MADE ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE ATTEMPTS AT BEING FUNNY, THE WOMEN LAUGHED WAY MORE OFTEN IN RESPONSE TO JOKES, VICE WRITES. THE MORE WOMEN LAUGHED, THE MORE THEIR INTEREST IN THE OTHER PERSON WENT UP. THAT WASN'T TRUE FOR MEN WHO LAUGHED AT WOMEN'S JOKES THEY DIDN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE HUMOR. RESEARCHERS BELIEVE THIS PHENOMENA HAS GROWN OUT OF TRADITIONAL SOCIAL VALUES. MEN HAVE LONG USED HUMOR AS A MEANS OF FLIRTING AND WOMEN ACCEPT IT. NOT ALL WOMEN, THOUGH. COMEDIC GENIUSES LIKE TINA FEY, AMY POEHLER AND AMY SCHUMER HAVE CARVED THEIR WAY INTO A MALE-DOMINATED INDUSTRY, PROVING THAT JOKES COMING FROM FEMALES CAN BE HEARD, AND EVEN REVERED. A VANITY FAIR ARTICLE FROM WAY BACK IN 2008 EXPLAINS THAT THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HILARIOUS WOMEN. FROM LUCILLE BALL AND PHYLLIS DILLER TO JOAN RIVERS AND CAROL BURNETT, THESE ICONIC COMEDIENNES HAVE BEEN SETTING THE RIGHT EXAMPLE: IF YOURE FUNNY, FLAUNT IT. MEN WILL EVENTUALLY SHUT UP AND APPRECIATE THE HUMOR.
44	BY ZHIQUN ZHU (CHINA DAILY USA) UPDATED: 2015-09-23 11:51:27 PESSIMISM ABOUT US-CHINA RELATIONS SEEMS TO BE PERMEATING THE AIR RECENTLY. MANY OBSERVERS ON BOTH SIDES HAVE RUNG ALARM BELLS ABOUT GROWING TENSION IN THE RELATIONSHIP, ESPECIALLY OVER CYBERSECURITY, THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND STOCK MARKET TURMOIL. WHAT HAS GONE WRONG? HOW CAN THE TWO COUNTRIES MOVE THIS VITAL RELATIONSHIP FORWARD? IN 1940, KENNETH WHERRY, MAYOR OF PAWNEE CITY, NEBRASKA, SAID, "WITH GOD'S HELP, WE WILL LIFT SHANGHAI UP AND UP, EVER UP, UNTIL IT IS JUST LIKE KANSAS CITY." IF WHERRY, WHO BECAME A US SENATOR LATER, WERE STILL ALIVE TODAY, HE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT MODERN SHANGHAI REMAINS DIFFERENT FROM KANSAS CITY, BUT IT IS PROBABLY KANSAS CITY THAT NEEDS TO BE LIFTED UP IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT NOW. AMERICANS HAVE A MISSIONARY IMPULSE TO CHANGE CHINA, EITHER BY CHRISTIANIZING IT IN THE 19TH CENTURY OR DEMOCRATIZING IT IN THE 21ST CENTURY. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF INTERACTIONS, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN DEALING WITH CHINA FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH; IT IS ILL-PREPARED TO LIVE WITH A NATION AS BIG AND ALMOST AS POWERFUL AS ITSELF. CHINA'S METEORIC RE-EMERGENCE AS A GLOBAL POWER BY THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY IS TRULY STUNNING TO AMERICANS AND EVEN TO MANY CHINESE. THE US ECONOMY SUFFERED SERIOUSLY IN THE 2008-2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS, FROM WHICH IT IS STILL RECOVERING. MEANWHILE, THE CHINESE ECONOMY HAS CONTINUED TO CHARGE FORWARD, AND AFTER OVERTAKING JAPAN AS THE WORLD'S SECOND-LARGEST ECONOMY IN 2010, IT IS POISED TO TAKE THE TOP SPOT SOON. THE GLOBAL POWER STRUCTURE HAS CHANGED FUNDAMENTALLY. THE AMERICAN CONCERN ABOUT CHINA'S RISING POWER REFLECTS AMERICANS' LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THEIR COMPETITION WITH CHINA. THE REALITY IS THAT CHINA REMAINS A DEVELOPING COUNTRY DESPITE A LARGE ECONOMY. ACCORDING TO PREMIER LI KEQIANG, 200 MILLION CHINESE STILL LIVE IN POVERTY. CHINA FACES TREMENDOUS DOMESTIC CHALLENGES, INCLUDING A WIDENING INCOME GAP, AN AGING POPULATION, RAMPANT CORRUPTION AND A DETERIORATING ENVIRONMENT. THE UNITED STATES REMAINS FAR AHEAD OF CHINA, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION. THE TWO ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES ARE COMPLEMENTARY IN MANY ASPECTS. A RECENT STUDY BY THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON US-CHINA RELATIONS AND THE RHODIUM GROUP REVEALS THAT FROM 2000 TO 2014, CHINESE FIRMS SPENT NEARLY $46 BILLION ON NEW ESTABLISHMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS IN THE US. CHINESE-AFFILIATED COMPANIES DIRECTLY EMPLOY MORE THAN 80,000 AMERICANS. IF THE US CONTINUES TO WELCOME CHINA'S BOOMING INVESTMENT, IT COULD RECEIVE BETWEEN $100 BILLION TO $200 BILLION FROM CHINA BY 2020, WHICH WOULD ADD BETWEEN 200,000 AND 400,000 FULL-TIME JOBS IN THE US. CHINA IS THE LARGEST TRADING PARTNER OF A GROWING NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, FROM ASIA TO AFRICA AND FROM LATIN AMERICA TO THE MIDDLE EAST. A TRADE REGIME WITHOUT CHINA'S PARTICIPATION IS UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED. CHINA-LED NEW INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE ASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT BANK (AIIB) COMPLEMENT THE WORK OF THE WORLD BANK AND ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK. "PIVOT" AND "NEW TYPE OF GREAT POWER RELATIONS" ARE ATTEMPTS BY THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, RESPECTIVELY, TO HANDLE THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP, BUT THEY ARE POORLY DEFINED AND LARGELY MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE OTHER SIDE. AMERICANS GENERALLY BELIEVE THAT CHINA HAS BECOME MORE ASSERTIVE IN FOREIGN POLICY AND INTENDS TO REPLACE THE US IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS. MANY CHINESE GENUINELY THINK THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING TO BLOCK CHINA'S RISE. LACK OF TRUST HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE OUTSTANDING PROBLEM BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. BUT HOW TO BUILD TRUST? GOING FORWARD, THE TWO COUNTRIES MUST FIRST READJUST THEIR MENTALITY. FOR CHINA, THE PRIORITY REMAINS AT HOME. CHINESE LEADERS MUST RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO FLEX MUSCLES ABROAD. IT IS NOT TIME TO ABANDON DENG XIAOPING'S DICTUM OF LYING LOW AND FOCUSING ON GROWTH. THE UNITED STATES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MUST BE REALISTIC AND REMOVE IDEOLOGICAL LENSES TO OVERCOME THE "CHINA FEAR". IT MUST ALSO REIN IN ITS SMALLER ALLIES IN ASIA SO AS TO AVOID CONFLICTS THAT WILL DRAG THE US AND CHINA INTO DIRECT CONFRONTATION. CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE JOINED AT THE HIP. THERE IS NO BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THEM. THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO ALLOW HARDLINERS OR PROTECTIONISTS TO INTERFERE WITH THE GENERALLY COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP. DISAGREEMENT ON CERTAIN ISSUES AND OCCASIONAL QUARRELS ARE PART OF THE NORMAL LIFE IN A RELATIONSHIP. MUTUAL ACCOMMODATION AND APPRECIATION WILL ENHANCE PERSONAL RELATIONS AS WELL AS RELATIONS BETWEEN NATIONS. ZHIQUN ZHU IS A PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AT BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY IN LEWISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA. (CHINA DAILY USA 09/23/2015 PAGE12)
45	AT THE UNVEILING OF HIS TAX PLAN MONDAY, DONALD TRUMP DEPLOYED A THOROUGHLY DEBUNKED STATISTIC ABOUT THE AMERICAN JOBS MARKET. THE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, HE CLAIMED, IS SOMEWHERE NEAR 42 PERCENT. WHAT ABOUT THE THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SAID WAS 5.1 PERCENT FOR LAST MONTH ? THAT NUMBER, TRUMP SAID, IS THE BIGGEST JOKE THERE IS IN THIS COUNTRY. IN AUGUST, TRUMP MADE THE SAME STATEMENT TO TIME MAGAZINE . I SAW A CHART THE OTHER DAY, OUR REAL UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NINETY MILLION PEOPLE THAT ARENT WORKING. NINETY-THREE MILLION TO BE EXACT," HE SAID. WHATEVER CHART THAT WAS, TRUMP WAS READING ITWRONG. AND HES BEEN CALLED ON HIS ERROR REPEATEDLY . MY COLLEAGUE GLENN KESSLER WROTE A THOROUGH TAKEDOWN AT THE TIME, POINTING OUT THAT TRUMP WAS LUMPING TOGETHER RETIREES, STUDENTS, STAY-AT-HOME MOMS, AND ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARENT FIGURED INTO THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BECAUSE THEY ARENT AVAILABLE TO WORK. IT DOESNT SEEM THAT TRUMP WAS PAYING ATTENTION, SO WERE GOING TO TRY AGAIN WITH CHARTS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE LAST YEAR WAS, ON AVERAGE, 6.2 PERCENT, WHICH REFLECTS ABOUT 9.6 MILLION UNEMPLOYED OUT OF 156 MILLION IN THE CIVILIAN LABOR FORCE (PEOPLE READY AND ABLETO WORK, OR ACTIVELY LOOKING). TO BE OFFICIALLY UNEMPLOYED IN AMERICA, YOU HAVE TO HAVE LOOKED FOR WORK WITHIN THE PAST MONTH. NOW, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE STOPPED LOOKING FOR WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO DISCOURAGED BY THE CRAPPY ECONOMY. BUT MOST PEOPLE WHO AREN'T SEEKING EMPLOYMENT ARE BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS: LEARNING TO WALK, GOING TO SCHOOL, STAYING AT HOME TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN, TAKING A BREATHER FROM WORK, RETIRING TO THE GOOD LIFE. THIS CHART BREAKS IT DOWN: TRUMP MAY HAVE SEEN THAT 92 MILLIONFIGURE ON A CHART SOMEWHERE. AND ITS TRUE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARENT LOOKING FOR WORK. BUT THATS NOT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND WORK THEY WANT. AS NOTED ABOVE, MOST OF THEM HAVE A PRETTY GOOD REASON NOT TO WORK. OF THOSE 92 MILLION PEOPLE OVER 16 WHO WEREN'T LOOKING FOR WORK IN 2014, 86 MILLION (93 PERCENT) DID NOT WANT A JOB RIGHT THEN, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT SURVEYS. HERE ARE A FEW MORE DETAILS ON HOW THAT GROUP OF AMERICANS BREAKS DOWN: WITHOUT IDENTIFYING ANY ONE IN PARTICULAR, TRUMP SAID MONDAY THAT SOME GREAT ECONOMISTS HAVE PUT THE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 30 PERCENT, 32 PERCENT. HE THEN SAID THE NUMBER MIGHT EVEN BE 42 PERCENT, SAYING THAT'S "THE HIGHEST I'VE HEARD." THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO A 42 PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD BE TO COUNT EVERYONE'S GRANDMAS AND STAY-AT-HOME SPOUSES AS UNEMPLOYED. TO TAKE THIS KIND OF THINKING TO ITS LOGICAL EXTREME, CONSIDER THAT ONLY 146 MILLION OF AMERICA'S 319 MILLION WERE EMPLOYED IN 2014. MORE THAN HALF OF AMERICANS DID NOT HAVE JOBS (IN PART BECAUSE THEY WERE TEETHING). MAYBE THE REAL REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SHOULD BE54 PERCENT? OF COURSE NOT. BUT TRUMP IS CORRECT IN HIS SUSPICION THAT THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBER DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY. OF THE 92 MILLION AMERICANS WHO DIDN'T HAVE JOBS IN 2014, 6 MILLION WANTED A JOB BUT HADN'T BEEN LOOKING RECENTLY. THEY WEREN'T COUNTED IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, SINCE, WELL, THEY WEREN'T LOOKING. THE REASONS VARIED: SOME WENT BACK TOSCHOOL OR BECAME OCCUPIED WITH FAMILY MATTERS. SOME SIMPLY GAVE UP ON FINDING A JOB. THAT LAST CATEGORY DISCOURAGED WORKERS MAY BE WHAT TRUMP WAS REFERRING IN HIS SPEECH MONDAY. HE SAID, WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AND LOOK AND LOOK AND THEN THEY GIVE UP LOOKING FOR A JOB, THEY'RE TAKEN OFF THE ROLLS. THE SCALE OF THE DISCOURAGED-WORKER PROBLEM, THOUGH, IS MUCH SMALLER THAN TRUMP APPEARS TO BELIEVE. IN AUGUST, THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES THAT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 624,000 DISCOURAGED WORKERS FAR FROM 92 MILLION. THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS REPORTS AN ALTERNATIVE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT INCLUDES DISCOURAGED WORKERS. THAT NUMBER WAS 5.5 PERCENT IN AUGUST, COMPARED WITH THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH WAS 5.1. THERES ANOTHER , BROADER MEASURE OF UNEMPLOYMENT THAT THROWS IN THE MARGINALLY ATTACHED ANYONE WHO LOOKED FOR A JOB IN THE PAST YEAR, BUT NOT WITHIN THE PAST FOUR WEEKS. THERE WERE ABOUT 1.8 MILLION OF THOSE IN AUGUST. ADDING THEM TO THE MIX BUMPS UP THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO 6.2 PERCENT. FINALLY, THE MOST EXPANSIVE WAY THE GOVERNMENT MEASURES UNEMPLOYMENT ALSO FIGURES IN PART-TIME WORKERS WHO CANT FIND FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT. THERE WERE 6.3 MILLION OF THOSE IN AUGUST, AND THEY BRING THE RATE UP TO 10.3 PERCENT. ALL OF THESE NUMBERS PRESENT A USEFUL WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THOSE WHO WANT TO WORK IN AMERICA. THE NUMBER 42 PERCENT? THATS NOT THE ANSWER TO ANYTHING. JEFF GUO IS A STAFF WRITER FOR STORYLINE. HE'S FROM MARYLAND (BUT OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY). FOLLOW HIM ON TWITTER: @_JEFFGUO .
46	A RECENT CLAIM FROM A STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT ALPHA TESTER HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE GAME IS BROKEN AND THAT IT IS RUSHED BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF THE MOVIE, EPISODE 7: THE FORCE AWAKENS THIS DECEMBER. DO PLAYERS HAVE TO START WORRYING ABOUT THE QUALITY OF STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WHEN IT RELEASES THIS NOVEMBER AND DO THE CLAIMS HOLD ANY MERIT, OR IS IT THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE AT WORK? HERE IS WHY RECENT CLAIMS BY A SUPPOSED ALPHA TESTER SHOULDNT GET YOU TOO WORRIED. THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT FIRST AND FOREMOST, THERE WILL BE AN OPEN BETA COMING IN EARLY OCTOBER. I RECENTLY REPORTED ON THE OPEN BETA AND ASKED IF A BETA OPEN TO EVERYONE COULD BE A SIGN OF OVERCONFIDENCE ON EAS PART. IF YOUVE BEEN ON THE FENCE ABOUT BUYING THE GAME, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF WITHOUT ANY KIND OF MONETARY INVESTMENT (EXCEPT FOR DOWNLOADING THE BETA, THE SIZE OF WHICH IS NOT CONFIRMED. IF STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WAS REALLY A BUG FILLED MESS, THEN AN OPEN BETA WOULD BE THE WORST POSSIBLE DECISION FROM EA AND DICE. IM NOT SAYING THE BETA WILL BE PERFECT, BUT TO THINK THAT THE DEVELOPER AND PUBLISHER WILL HOST AN OPEN BETA FOR A BROKEN GAME IS PREPOSTEROUS. THE SECOND IMPORTANT ASPECT TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE CLAIMS COME FROM AN ALPHA TEST, NOT BETA. ALPHA TEST VERSIONS ARE GENERALLY BUG FILLED MESSES, AS IT IS A VERY EARLY BUILD OF THE GAME TO TEST FUNCTIONALITY. IF THE QUALITY OF A RELEASE VERSION OF ANY GAME WAS DETERMINED BY AN ALPHA TEST VERSION, EVERY GAME RELEASE WOULD BE A BROKEN MESS. FURTHERMORE, EA IS SEEMINGLY DOING A GOOD JOB WITH THE MULTIPLAYER, AS GARETH WOODS TRIED THE SQUADRON FIGHTER MODE LAST MONTH AND PRAISED THE GAME MODE FOR ITS AUTHENTIC FEELING AND FAST PACED ACTION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MR. WOODS DID NOT MENTION ANY BUGS OR ANYTHING GAME-BREAKING. NEOGAF USER ILLUCIO CLAIMS: I'VE BEEN ALPHA TESTING A FEW GAMES AND I CAN SAY BATTLEFRONT IS A COMPLETE MESS AND IS BROKEN. CONSIDERING THAT THEIR DEADLINE FOR THE GAME IS IN A FEW WEEKS AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T FIXED THE MAJORITY OF THE IN GAME PROBLEMS LET ALONE THE CONNECTION PROBLEM ME AND OTHER TESTERS WERE HAVING, YES IT'S GOING TO BE A MESS. AND EVEN A DAY 1 PATCH WON'T FIX ALL OF THEM, I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH OUTSIDE WHAT I PLAYED, BUT THE GAME IS INDEED RUSHED AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF EPISODE 7 RELEASING THIS DECEMBER. AND IN RETROSPECT I ALSO TESTED BLACK OPS 3 WHICH EVEN THOUGH IT HAD MANY PROBLEMS, IT WAS NO WHERE AS BAD AS BATTLEFRONT. SOURCE DO PLAYERS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED? IF YOU TAKE A LOOK BACK AT BATTLEFIELD 4'S LAUNCH, THEY DO HAVE A REASON NOT TO TRUST EA. MY NICHOLAS HOLDEN COLLEAGUE REPORTED MULTIPLE BATTLEFIELD 4 ISSUES, PC VERSION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY. HOWEVER, THE LATEST ENTRY IN THE BATTLEFIELD FRANCHISE, BATTLEFIELD: HARDLINE HAD AN EXCELLENT LAUNCH, AS I NOTED IN MY REVIEW THAT THE GAME WAS BASICALLY BUG FREE. IS THE BUG FREE STATE OF HARDLINE AT LAUNCH THE START OF A QUALITY LAUNCH TREND BY EA? HOPEFULLY. THE NEOGAF THREAD IN QUESTION IS ENTITLED QA TESTERS WARN: BROKEN GAMES FIASCO OF LAST YEAR MAY REPEAT THIS CHRISTMAS . ATTACHED IS A POLL ON WHICH AAA GAME, COMING THIS HOLIDAY, THE COMMUNITY THINKS WILL HAVE THE MOST BUGS. AT THE TIME OF WRITING, FALLOUT 4 IS ON TOP OF THE POLL, WITH ASSASSINS CREED: SYNDICATE IN SECOND PLACE AND STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT IN THIRD. HAVE PLAYERS LOST THEIR FAITH IN AAA GAME DEVELOPERS TO DELIVER A QUALITY, BUG FREE TITLE? IT SURE LOOKS THAT WAY. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING SCEPTICAL ABOUT A PRODUCT WHEN PREVIOUS TITLES BY A COMPANY HAVE HAD LESS THAN IDEAL LAUNCHES. HOWEVER, ITS ALSO NOT GOOD TO ALWAYS HAVE A GLASS HALF EMPTY OUTLOOK. I FOR ONE AM GIVING STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND WILL JUDGE THE GAME DURING THE OPEN BETA AND SUBSEQUENT FULL RELEASE. [EMBEDDED CONTENT] IN THE VIDEO ABOVE, YOU CAN SEE SOME ALPHA FOOTAGE IN ACTION, WHICH DOESNT LOOK BUGGY AT ALL. IF THERE IS ANY MERIT TO THE CLAIMS BY NEOGAF USER ILLUCIO, HOPEFULLY EA AND DICE WILL HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO FIX THE GAME BEFORE IT IS RELEASE. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT AN ALPHA VERSION OF THE GAME IS A LONG WAY OFF FULL RELEASE. STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WILL RELEASE ON PC, PLAYSTATION 4 AND XBOX ONE: NORTH AMERICA - NOVEMBER 17 EUROPE - NOVEMBER 19 (USUALLY SA RELEASE DATE AS WELL) UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 20 DO YOU THINK STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WILL BE BROKEN ON RELEASE OR WILL THE GAME HAVE LITTLE TO NO BUGS AT LAUNCH? LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK IN THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW. SOURCE: NEOGAF READ MORE ABOUT STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT: SILLICUR TWITTER /
47	SWEDEN HAS PRAISED ZAMBIA'S PROGRESS IN DIFFERENT SECTORS OF ITS ECONOMY. SWEDISH PRIME MINISTER, STAFAN LOFVEN COMMENDED ZAMBIA FOR THE REMARKABLE PROGRESS THE COUNTRY HAS MADE IN GENDER MAINSTREAMING AND OTHER SECTORS SINCE PRESIDENT EDGAR LUNGU TOOK OVER POWER. MR LOFVEN ALSO APPEALED FOR ZAMBIA'S SUPPORT IN ITS BID FOR A NON-PERMANENT SEAT ON THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL FOR THE PERIOD 2017 TO 2018.? MR LOFVEN MADE THE APPEAL TO PRESIDENT EDGAR LUNGU ON FRIDAY WHEN THE TWO LEADERS HELD BILATERAL TALKS ON THE SIDELINES OF THE ONGOING UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY AT THE UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. MR LOFVEN SAID ZAMBIA HAD RECORDED REMARKABLE PROGRESS IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS ON ISSUES OF MAINSTREAMING GENDER WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS GOOD FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY. MR LOFVEN ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD INSTRUCT THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR TO ZAMBIA TO LIAISE WITH COMMERCE MINISTER MARGARET MWANAKATWE TO AGREE ON THE INCREASED SWEDISH PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE ZAMBIAN ECONOMY. THE PRIME MINISTER NOTED WITH APPRECIATION THE GOVERNMENT'S AMBITION TO REVIVE THE FARMING COOPERATIVES AS IT WAS A MAJOR STEP TOWARDS RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND JOB CREATION. IN RESPONSE, MR LUNGU ASSURED SWEDEN OF ZAMBIA'S SUPPORT IN ITS BID FOR THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL SEAT. PRESIDENT LUNGU ALSO REQUESTED THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT FOR SUPPORT IN AREAS OF MODERNISING HEALTH EQUIPMENT, RESEARCH, NEW HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING MACHINES, MEDICAL AND LABORATORY EQUIPMENT. MR LUNGU UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR MORE SWEDISH INVESTMENT AND URGED SWEDISH INVESTORS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GOOD ENVIRONMENT IN ZAMBIA. HE SAID ZAMBIA'S STABLE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, ECONOMIC FISCAL REGIME AND POLICIES OFFERED GREAT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. MR LUNGU INVITED SWEDISH INVESTORS TO ZAMBIA TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES IN FARMING BLOCS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED. THE PRESIDENT SAID MORE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES EXISTED IN THE MINING, ENERGY, INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, ENERGY AND TOURISM AMONG OTHERS.

AN OFFICIAL SAID TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO SUGGESTED ALTERATIONS TO A DOCUMENT DEALING WITH MANAGEMENT OF CASES OF FATAL FOETAL ANOMALIES MIGHT ENDANGER THEIR SAFETY. IN A NOTE EXPLAINING THE DECISION TO REDACT THE IDENTITY OF THE AUTHORS OF TWO EMAILS DISCUSSING THE ISSUE, THE HSES FREEDOM OF INFORMATION DECISION-MAKER STATED: I AM INFORMED THAT THERE ARE PRECEDENTS WHERE COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN PURSUED IN AN INAPPROPRIATE FASHION. SHE SAID IT WAS RECOGNISED TO BE AN EMOTIVE AND DIFFICULT AREA, AROUSING STRONG FEELINGS ON ALL SIDES. THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PHRASE FATAL FETAL [SIC] ANOMALY WITH LIFE LIMITING FETAL ANOMALY IN A DOCUMENT PUBLISHED BY THE HSE LAST JULY WAS CRITICISED BY GROUPS REPRESENTING IRISH WOMEN WHO HAVE GONE TO THE UK TO TERMINATE THEIR PREGNANCIES AFTER RECEIVING A PROGNOSIS THAT THEIR BABY WOULD NOT LIVE AFTER BIRTH. IN INTERNAL EMAILS, ONE MEMBER OF A HSE SUBGROUP CHARGED WITH DRAWING UP NATIONAL CARE STANDARDS FOR PREGNANCY BEREAVEMENTS RECOMMENDED A CHANGE TO THE WAY FATAL FOETAL ANOMALY IS DEFINED. THE RECORDS SHOW REFERENCES TO FATAL FETAL ANOMALY IN EARLIER DRAFTS OF THE STANDARDS DOCUMENT WERE CHANGED TO LIFE-LIMITING FOETAL ANOMALIES. THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION ALLOWS FOR REQUESTS TO BE REFUSED IF ACCESS TO THE RECORD COULD REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO ENDANGER THE LIFE OR SAFETY OF ANY PERSON. IN A STATEMENT, A HSE SPOKESWOMAN SAID ALL TERMS USED IN THE CURRENT GLOSSARY WERE REVIEWED BY THE SUBGROUP IN CONJUNCTION WITH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE.

TV: ESPN SERIES: USC LEADS ARIZONA STATE 19-12, WHICH INCLUDES ONE VICTORY THAT WAS LATER VACATED BECAUSE OF NCAA SANCTIONS. THE SUN DEVILS HAVE WON THREE OF THE PAST FOUR MEETINGS, INCLUDING A 38-34 WIN LAST YEAR ON A HAIL MARY PASS IN THE COLISEUM. RANKINGS: USC 19TH KEYS TO THE GAME USC HEADS TO ARIZONA STATE THIS WEEK IN DESPERATION MODE. IT MIGHT BE TOO EARLY TO PRESS THE PANIC BUTTON AFTER THE TROJANS WERE UPSET IN THE CONFERENCE OPENER, 41-31 AT HOME TO STANFORD, BUT THEIR MARGIN OF ERROR IN THE CHASE FOR THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF VERY LIKELY HAS VANISHED. SO, TOO, MIGHT HOPES OF THE WINNING THE PAC-12 SOUTH IF IT DROPS TO 0-2. "THERE'S OBVIOUSLY STILL A BAD TASTE IN OUR MOUTH BUT I THINK OUR PLAYERS UNDERSTAND THERE'S PLENTY LEFT OUT THERE FOR US THIS SEASON, A GREAT DEAL THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH," COACH STEVE SARKISIAN SAID. USC STILL HAS THE PIECES TO BE GREAT, AND SARKISIAN WAS IN A STAY-THE-COURSE MODE, EVEN AFTER THE DEFENSE WAS GASHED BY STANFORD. "THE NATURAL THING IS TO PANIC, TO ALL OF A SUDDEN SCRAP ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF AND TRY SOMETHING NEW," SARKISIAN SAID. "AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS THING TO DO. WE HAVE TO BELIEVE AND TRUST IN THE WORK WE'VE PUT IN TO GET TO THIS POINT. "THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS, THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO PLAY TO THE STRENGTHS OF OUR TEAM. ... "WE'VE GOT GOOD SCHEMES. WE NEED TO PREPARE OUR PLAYERS BETTER SO THEY CAN GO OUT AND PERFORM BETTER." SARKISIAN MIGHT BE ON THINNER ICE THAN HE TYPICALLY WOULD BECAUSE OF HIS EMBARRASSING PRESEASON ALCOHOL-FUELED INCIDENT AT A BOOSTER EVENT, BUT HE'LL LEAN ON SOME RECENT HISTORY TO BOOST HIS CASE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF RESILIENCY. "I MADE A POINT TO THE TEAM THAT AT JUST ABOUT THIS POINT LAST YEAR, OHIO STATE HAS ALREADY LOST AT HOME TO VIRGINIA TECH AND ARIZONA IS ABOUT TO BEAT OREGON AT HOME," SARKISIAN SAID. "AND THOSE TWO TEAMS GO ON TO PLAY FOR THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. SO WE CAN REBOUND FROM THIS." PLAYERS TO WATCH TROJANS --WR JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER HAS BEEN UNSTOPPABLE SO FAR. THE SOPHOMORE HAS 22 CATCHES FOR 434 YARDS AND FOUR TOUCHDOWNS.

HIS ABILITY TO MAKE AN IMPACT RIGHT AWAY CAN LESSEN THE BURDEN ON MULTI-PURPOSE THREAT ADOREE' JACKSON AND ALLOW THE TALENTED SOPHOMORE TO PLAY MORE AT WIDE RECEIVER, AS COACH STEVE SARKISIAN SEES FIT.

HE WAS LIMITED IN PRACTICE EARLY IN THE WEEK. USC HAS A LOT OF DEPTH BEHIND HIM, BUT HE'D BE NICE TO HAVE AT FULL STRENGTH, AS THE OFT-INJURED SENIOR IS OFF TO A GOOD START, HAVING CARRIED 28 TIMES FOR 206 YARDS AND FOUR SCORES. SUN DEVILS --RB DEMARIO RICHARD, A SOPHOMORE, IS GOING TO BE A FORCE IN A LEAGUE ALREADY FILLED WITH STELLAR RUNNING BACKS.

55	THE 19-YEAR-OLD DRIVER OF THE AMERICAN RACING CUSTOM WHEELS SPIKE-ESSLINGER TRAILS FOURTH PLACE TANNER THORSON BY 29 POINTS, 535-506. JERRY COONS JR. IS FIFTH WITH 526 AND SPENCER BAYSON IS SIXTH WITH 519. THREE EVENTS IN THE SERIES REMAIN FOLLOWING THE GOLD CROWN. THIS IS THE FIRST FULL USAC NATIONAL MIDGET CAMPAIGN FOR THOMAS AND HES ACTUALLY IN STRIKING RANGE OF OVERTAKING THIRD PLACE RICO ABREU, WHO HAS 588 POINTS. THOMAS TOP GOAL IS TO WIN HIS FIRST USAC NATIONAL EVENT. I REALLY WANT TO WIN BAD, HE SAID. ITS FRUSTRATING REALLY. WERE A LITTLE BIT OUT-EXPERIENCED, BUT I THINK ITS DOABLE. WE NEED TO GET ALL THE STARS ALIGN FOR A NIGHT. IT WOULD BE COOL TO FINISH AT LEAST THIRD IN THE POINTS. ITS THE FIRST TIME FOR US AT A LOT OF THESE TRACKS. THOMAS RACED IN THE GOLD CROWN AT THE THREE-EIGHTHS MILE TRACK IN 2013 AND MADE THE FEATURE ON ALL THREE NIGHTS. HIS BEST FINISH WAS 18TH. WEVE HAD A COUPLE OF GOOD RUNS THERE, BUT NOTHING SPECTACULAR, THOMAS SAID. IT WILL BE OUR FIRST TIME THERE WITH THE SPIKE. WELL HAVE A CLEAN SHEET OF PAPER AS FAR AS NOTES GO. I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT. THE GOLD CROWNS FORMAT DOESNT HAVE QUALIFYING, WHICH HASNT BEEN OUR STRENGTH, AND YOU LINE UP OFF THE DRAW AND HEATS. THAT SHOULD HELP US. THOMAS WILL RACE ON SUNDAY IN THE ASCS WARRIOR REGION IN JEFF SMITHS 360-CUBIC INCH WINGED SPRINT CAR AT RANDOLPH COUNTY RACEWAY IN MOBERLY, MO. HE HAS THREE TOP-FIVES IN SEVEN STARTS IN ASCS WARRIOR. THOMAS HAS RACED ONCE PREVIOUSLY AT RANDOLPH COUNTY, IN AN ASCS WARRIOR EVENT. WE ALMOST HAD A TOP FIVE, HE SAID. WE HAD A DRIVELINE FAILURE. IM REALLY EXCITED TO GO BACK. THOMAS FINISHED 15TH IN A COMBINED ASCS NATIONAL/WARRIOR FEATURE ON AUG. 23 AT THE MISSOURI STATE FAIR SPEEDWAY IN SEDALIA. HE WAS SEVENTH IN THE HEAT AND THIRD IN THE B FEATURE. WE WENT FROM STARTING EIGHTH TO THIRD IN THE B, THOMAS SAID. THE TRACK CAME TO US. WE STARTED 19TH IN THE FEATURE AND THE TRACK RUBBERED UP INTO ONE LINE AND WE FINISHED 15TH. THOMAS FINISHED FIFTH IN THE POWRI LUCAS OIL NATIONAL MIDGET SERIES ON AUG. 21 AT LINCOLN (ILL.) SPEEDWAY. HE FINISHED 19TH ON AUG. 18 AT SPRING RUN, PA., AND NINTH ON AUG. 19 AT OXFORD, PA., IN USAC NATIONAL MIDGETS. WE STARTED 11TH IN THE POWRI FEATURE AND WERE RACING FOR THIRD WHEN I WENT ABOVE THE CUSHION AND FELL TO SIXTH, THOMAS SAID. WE DIDNT HAVE ANY YELLOWS AFTER THE FIFTH LAP. THAT MISTAKE REALLY KILLED US. WE WERE RUNNING FOURTH AT SPRING RUN AND THATS PROBABLY WHERE WE WERE GOING TO FINISH, BUT WE BROKE A RIGHT REAR HUB. THE NEXT NIGHT, AT OXFORD, WE LACKED SOME SPEED IN QUALIFYING AND STARTED 15TH IN THE FEATURE. WE MADE SOME CHANGES FOR THE HEAT RACE AND GOT THE CAR WORKING VERY GOOD AND WON IT. WE HAD A PRETTY STRONG RUN TO NINTH IN THE FEATURE. TYLER THOMAS WILL DRIVE THE AMERICAN RACING CUSTOM WHEELS SPIKE-ESSLINGER FRIDAY AND SATURDAY IN THE GOLD CROWN NATIONALS, A HONDA USAC NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP EVENT, AT TRI-CITY SPEEDWAY IN GRANITE CITY, ILL. PADDOCKTALK PERSPECTIVE
56	EACH DAY WE SEE THE EFFORT OF UNIONS TO FORCE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY FARM WORKERS TO PAY BRIBES TO WORK. THEN YOU  HAVE THE EFFORT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES ARE FORCING WORKERS TO SPEND MORE ON WORKING CONDITIONS. THEN YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR FARMS, ESPECIALLY IF A NEW PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. THE SOLUTION ROBOTS AND MACHINES TO DO THE PICKING AND HARVESTING OF CROPS. WHILE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE NEW MACHINES, THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SO. YEARS AGO UC DAVIS DEVELOPED A TOMATO PICKING MACHINEBUT THE UNIONS STOPPED ITS DEVELOPMENT. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. AGAIN, AMERICA CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN AGRICULTURE INTERNATIONALLY. WE CAN INNOVATE AND FEED THE HUNGRY MASSES BY MAKING FOOD AVAILABILITY MORE RELIABLE AND LOW COST. 4 LABOR-INTENSIVE CROPS FARMERS WISH THEY HAD ROBOTS TO HARVEST ELIZA BARCLAY, KPBS, 9/7/15 THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION SAYS MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO PICK HOT AND BELL PEPPERS COULD HELP SOLVE LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEMS. IF YOURE ENJOYING A LATE-SUMMER FRUIT PIE THIS LABOR DAY, CONSIDER WHAT WENT INTO GROWING AND HARVESTING THAT FRUIT. CHANCES ARE, IT TOOK A LOT OF HUMAN HANDS TO ENSURE ITS SKIN WOULD BE PERFECT AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. WHILE MACHINES HAVE REPLACED HUMAN HANDS FOR A LOT OF FARM JOBS THE HARVESTING OF TOMATOES FOR PROCESSING, THE CUTTING OF LETTUCE AND SPINACH, SHAKING OF ALMOND TREES TO MAKE THE NUTS FALL TO THE GROUND MANY FRUIT, VEGETABLE AND NUT FARMERS STILL RELY HEAVILY ON PEOPLE TO PLANT, MAINTAIN AND HARVEST THEIR CROPS. MACHINES DONT YET EXIST FOR THESE CROPS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN AMPLE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK, AND BECAUSE ITS HARD TO DESIGN MACHINES THAT CAN CUT OR PICK THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLES WITHOUT SQUISHING OR DAMAGING THEM TOO MUCH. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. ALL THATS CREATED A NEW PUSH FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO MECHANIZATION TO REPLACE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME FILLING. THERES AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF FRESH-MARKET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS, MATTHEW WHITING , AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND EXTENSION SPECIALIST AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEET CHERRY INDUSTRY, TELLS THE SALT. THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED HARVEST LABOR IS ON EVERY GROWERS MIND. FOR LABOR DAY, WE THOUGHT WED ROUND UP SOME OF THE CROPS THAT CANT YET BE HARVESTED BY A MACHINE, BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE FUTURE. TO BE CLEAR, THE ISSUE OF FARM LABOR IS COMPLICATED. AND MACHINES THAT COULD HARVEST THESE CROPS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE. SWEET CHERRIES THESE ARE THE SOFT, SWEET CHERRIES WE GET IN BAGS WITH THE STEM ATTACHED. AND WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND PLUMP? BECAUSE A HUMAN HAND CAREFULLY PICKED THEM. BUT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER WILLING HANDS TO DO THAT AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTICED. OF ALL THE PRODUCERS THAT DREAM OF MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO EASE THEIR LABOR WOES, THE SWEET CHERRY GROWERS MIGHT BE THE CLOSEST TO GETTING ONE THANKS TO RESEARCH FUNDING. MATT WHITING SAYS HE AND OTHERS AT WSU ARE CLOSE TO FINDING A COMMERCIAL PARTNER FOR A PROTOTYPE HARVESTER THAT CAN PICK 50 TIMES AS MANY CHERRIES AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD IN THE SAME TIME. STILL, THERES ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS NEW MODEL IS VIABLE: NEW VARIETIES OF CHERRIES SUITED TO THE MECHANICAL HARVESTER WILL NEED TO BE BRED. WHITING SAYS RESEARCH IS HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT IN 10 TO 12 YEARS, SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER GROWERS A SUITE OF NEW VARIETIES. ASPARAGUS AS THE HUFFINGTON POST HAS REPORTED , ASPARAGUS IS UNIQUELY LABOR INTENSIVE BECAUSE THE QUICK-GROWING PLANT MUST BE HARVESTED EVERY DAY OF ITS THREE-MONTH GROWING SEASON. EACH PLANT SPROUTS MULTIPLE SPEARS (THE PART OF THE PLANT WE EAT) A DAY, WHICH HAVE TO BE HAND-CUT EVERY DAY. SO THAT MEANS WORKERS ARE CUTTING 14 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FROM ROUGHLY FEBRUARY TO MAY. BUT VARIOUS MECHANICAL ASPARAGUS HARVESTERS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING THEM. ACCORDING TO A 2009 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT , IF THE U.S. ASPARAGUS INDUSTRY IS TO INSURE A COMPETITIVE POSITION, IT MUST SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGY FOR LABOR TO LOWER PER UNIT COSTS AND SHIFT THE WORKFORCE TO VALUE-ADDED EMPLOYMENT. INSTITUTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW. APPLES COMMERCIAL APPLE PICKING TODAY REQUIRES BRAWN WORKERS HAVE TO FILL BUCKETS ALL DAY LONG WITH HEAVY APPLES AND THEN DUMP THEM INTO BINS. AND ACCORDING TO A FRUIT INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION , THE ERA OF FULLY AUTOMATED ROBOTIC HARVESTERS NAVIGATING [APPLE] ORCHARD ROWS IS STILL YEARS AWAY. WHITING SAYS THATS BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS DEDICATED LITTLE FUNDING DEDICATED TO RESEARCH. THATS CHANGING, THOUGH. THE WASHINGTON STATE TREE FRUIT RESEARCH COMMISSION IS NOW PURSUING MORE RESEARCH ON MECHANICAL HARVESTING. AND THIS YEAR, SOME COMMERCIAL APPLE FARMERS MAY BE USING A VACUUM HARVESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME.  PEPPERS CALIFORNIA GROWS ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE PEPPERS IN THE U.S., AND LATELY THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION HAS BEEN TALKING MORE DEVELOPING MECHANICAL HARVESTING AND VARIETIES BRED TO BE PICKED BY MACHINES. ACCORDING TO A 2015 REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION, WITH INCREASING COST AND DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF LABOR NEEDED TO PICK PEPPERS, INNOVATION [SIMILAR TO THE PROCESSED TOMATO INDUSTRY] COULD GIVE AND U.S. FARMERS SIGNIFICANT RETURNS AND POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PEPPER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA, THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO HAVE FRESH MARKET QUALITY AND MECHANICAL HARVESTING IN BOTH BLOCKY [BELL PEPPERS] AND HOT TYPES.

57	SO. DAD'S WORD TRUMPS THE WORD OF TWO WOMEN. WHAT ELSE IS NEW IN THE AMERICAN COURTS.... WIFE #1 "ABDUCTED" THEIR SON BECAUSE OF ABUSE CONCERNS INVOLVING HIS FATHER. CPS EVEN RAISED CONCERNS. THERE ARE UNSPECIFIED COURT REPORTS. ALL HAND WAIVED AWAY BY AN INDIFFERENT COURT. WIFE #2 SOUGHT A PROTECTION ORDER. YOU DON'T GET THOSE UNLESS THERE HAS BEEN PHYSICAL VIOLENCE OR A CREDIBLE THREAT THEREOF. YOU DON'T GET THEM BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR SPOUSE ARE HAVING "TRYING TIMES"-THAT'S JUST DAD'S ATTEMPT TO TOTALLY MINIMIZE AND AVOID RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS. WIFE #2 DIDN'T RENEW. BAD SIGN. RESEARCH IS SHOWING THAT WHEN WOMEN DON'T RENEW IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE THREAT HAS GONE AWAY. IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WITHOUT FURTHER JEOPARDIZING THEIR OWN SAFETY. AND NOW THIS ABUSER HAS CHILD CUSTODY. DAD IS IDENTIFIED AS BRANDON RUFFIN. HTTP://WWW.HILLSDALE.NET/ARTICLE/20150915/NEWS/150919449 KIDNAPPER MOM ARRESTED, FATHER RETAINS CUSTODY BY JASON DAFNIS POSTED SEP. 15, 2015 AT 9:12 AM HILLSDALE, MICH. HILLSDALE AFTER A COURT HEARING ON MONDAY AFTERNOON, THE FATHER OF A BOY KIDNAPPED BY HIS MOTHER NOW RETAINS CUSTODY OF HIS SON. NICOLE RUFFIN DISAPPEARED WITH HER SON, LAREDO, AFTER JUDGE MIKE SMITH GRANTED INTERIM CUSTODY TO BRANDON RUFFIN, LAREDOS BIOLOGICAL FATHER AND NICOLES EX-HUSBAND, ON AUG. 31. THE COURT PROCEEDINGS WERE PUNCTUATED BY REPORTS FROM CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES QUESTIONING THE CHILDS SAFETY. AFTER HER DISAPPEARANCE, A FELONY WARRANT ISSUED FOR NICOLES ARREST ON A CHARGE OF PARENTAL KIDNAPPING. MICHIGAN STATE POLICE TRACKED AND EXHAUSTED SEVERAL LEADS SINCE SEPT. 1, LOCATING AND ARRESTING HER AT A SPRING ARBOR CONVENIENCE STORE ON MONDAY. LAREDO WAS REMANDED INTO POLICE CUSTODY AT THE SAME TIME. THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS, KARLYE HORTON, NICOLES ATTORNEY, SAID AT THE CIVIL HEARING ON MONDAY. NICOLE, HAVING BEEN LODGED AT THE HILLSDALE COUNTY JAIL ONLY HOURS BEFORE, WAS NOT PRESENT FOR THE PROCEEDINGS. HORTON QUESTIONED BRANDONS SUITABILITY AS LAREDOS CUSTODIAN, CITING SEVERAL COURT REPORTS ABOUT THE CHILDS SAFETY AROUND BRANDON. ONE OF THOSE REPORTS INCLUDED A PERSONAL PROTECTION ORDER HIS CURRENT WIFE, HANNAH, FILED AGAINST BRANDON EARLIER THIS YEAR. THAT RECORD CLAIMS THAT BRANDON LAID HANDS ON HANNAH, THOUGH BRANDON DENIES THOSE CLAIMS, SAYING THAT HE AND HIS WIFE HAD TRYING TIMES PRIOR TO THE PPOS EXPIRATION IN JULY. HANNAH AND BRANDON REMAIN TOGETHER TODAY. HORTON ALSO BROUGHT BEFORE SMITH THE CLAIM THAT BRANDON HADNT SEEN LAREDO MORE THAN A FEW TIMES SINCE BRANDON AND NICOLE WERE DIVORCED IN 2012. AGAIN, BRANDON REFUTED THE LEGITIMACY OF THAT ARGUMENT, SAYING THAT HE WAS NEVER SERVED THE PROPER DIVORCE PAPERS OR CUSTODY NOTIFICATIONS. I SAW MY SON ON A REGULAR BASIS, BRANDON SAID. HE CLAIMS THAT AFTER THE DIVORCE, HIS ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT NICOLE FOR SCHEDULING WERE CHRONICALLY IGNORED. HANNAH AND OTHER MEMBERS OF BRANDONS FAMILY AND FRIENDS WERE PRESENT IN THE COURTROOM, AS WERE MEMBERS OF NICOLES FAMILY, BOTH SUPPORTING THEIR RESPECTIVE SIDES. BRANDON HAS BEEN DISHONEST ABOUT HIS POSITION IN THE COURT, HORTON SAID. SMITH CONTINUED BRANDONS INTERIM CUSTODY, AN ORDER WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT MONDAY AND RUNS THROUGH AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING SCHEDULED FOR OCT. 23. A MORE SOLID CUSTODY RULING IS EXPECTED TO BE IMPOSED ON THAT DATE. HORTON DECLINED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF HER CLIENT FOLLOWING THE HEARING. I AM A LOVING DAD, BRANDON SAID AFTER THE CONFERENCE. IM GONNA KEEP FIGHTING FOR CUSTODY OF MY SON UNTIL THE GOOD LORD SAYS I CANT ANYMORE. ITS A HAPPY DAY."
58	THE BIG WOODS ON AVERILLS ISLAND IS THE SITE OF AN AUDUBON PRE-THANKSGIVING GUIDED WALK TO DISCOVER WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD OF NATURE AS PLANTS AND ANIMALS PREPARE FOR WINTER. FALL IS A GREAT TIME TO TAKE THE FAMILY TO AN AUDUBON SANCTUARY TO WITNESS BIRD MIGRATION AND EMBRACE THE CHANGING SEASON. SANCTUARIES ACROSS NEW ENGLAND GIVE FAMILIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THE NATURAL WORLD THROUGH OBSERVATIONS OF NOT ONLY BIRDS, BUT MAMMALS AS WELL. CREATURES HAVE A LOT TO DO TO PREPARE FOR WINTER AND EVEN WHEN THE SNOW FLIES, THERE ARE STILL SOME BIRDS AND ANIMALS AROUND TO TRACK. AUDUBON CENTERS SCHEDULE A VARIETY OF EVENTS, BUT YOU DONT NEED A SPECIFIC DATE AND TIME TO ENJOY THE GROUNDS. HIKING TRAILS FULL OF INTERESTING SITES INCLUDING THE WONDERFUL FALL COLORS ARE OPEN WHENEVER YOUR BUSY FAMILY HAS TIME TO SWING BY, FROM DAWN TO DUSK. YOU CAN SEE A LOT IN AUDUBON SANCTUARIES FROM MAINE TO MASSACHUSETTS THIS FALL; BUT FIRST, LETS TALK ABOUT THE BIRDS. WARBLERS ARE MOVING RIGHT NOW, SAYS DOUG HITCHCOX, STAFF NATURALIST AT GILSLAND FARM AUDUBON IN FALMOUTH. FROM MID- TO LATE-SEPTEMBER WARBLERS ARE PEAKING, BUT SPARROWS TEND TO MOVE A BIT LATER. IF YOU HOPE TO SEE COLORFUL BIRDS AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT BE A TAD DISAPPOINTED. SOME ARE MOLTING AND THE FEATHERS MIGHT BE A BIT DULL RIGHT NOW. BUT AS THE LEAVES FALL, THE BIRDS CAN BE SEEN MORE EASILY ON THEIR PERCHES IN THE TREES. ITS A BIT OF GIVE-AND-TAKE FOR BIRDING FANS. NORTHERN HARRIER AT THE IPSWICH RIVER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IN TOPSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, THE WATERFOWL MIGRATION IS IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE OF ITS SHEER NUMBERS. THE BEST PLACE TO WATCH THE WONDERFUL NATURAL SPECTACLE IS ALONG THE BUNKERS MEADOW TRAIL. CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE OBSERVATION TOWER TO REALLY TAKE IN THE MEADOW, SAYS SCOTT SANTINO, IPSWICH RIVER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY NATURALIST. THE BEST TIME TO SEE THEM IS AT DAWN WHEN THEY LEAVE THE MEADOW AND AT DUSK WHEN THEY FLY INTO IT. BUT ITS NOT JUST ABOUT THE FALL MIGRATION, AS IMPRESSIVE AS IT CAN BE. ON THE STAFF NATURALIST-LED BIRD WALKS HOSTED EVERY THURSDAY AT 7 A.M. THROUGH NOVEMBER AT GILSLAND FARM, THERE ARE PLENTY OF MAMMALS THAT OFFER SOME FASCINATING ENTERTAINMENT AS WELL. HITCHCOX EXPLAINS, WE HAD A GREAT ENCOUNTER ON ONE OF THE WEEKLY BIRD WALKS RECENTLY. WE SAW A WEASEL DART ACROSS THE TRAIL AND A FEW MINUTES LATER WE SPOTTED A DEAD MEADOW MOUSE ON THE PATH. WE STOPPED TO LOOK AT IT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE WEASEL CAME RUNNING RIGHT UP TO US AND SNATCHED THE MOUSE AND RAN OFF WITH IT. THE FUN THING ABOUT WALKING THESE TRAILS REGULARLY IS THAT THERE IS ALWAYS SOME SURPRISE. AT MOST AUDUBON CENTERS AND SANCTUARIES THERE ARE 8 IN MAINE AND MANY MORE ALL OVER NEW ENGLAND THERE ARE NATURALISTS AND TRAINED DOCENTS AVAILABLE TO HELP VISITORS IDENTIFY BIRDS AND WILDLIFE. ON SUNDAYS, THERE ARE VOLUNTEER DOCENTS AT IPSWICH RIVER THAT LEAD TOURS ON A DROP-IN BASIS. A BIG THRILL FOR KIDS AND ADULTS AT THIS PARTICULAR SANCTUARY IS THE FRIENDLINESS OF THE BIRDS: THEY ARE KNOWN TO LAND ON A VISITORS HAND TO NIBBLE SEEDS. BUT BE WARNED, THE CENTER DOESNT SELL SEEDS, SO BE SURE TO BRING YOUR OWN. AT GILSLAND FARM, THE 2- TO 6-YEAR-OLD CROWD HAS A FEW OPPORTUNITIES THIS FALL TO VISIT THE CENTER IN THEIR PAJAMAS. THE GOOD NIGHT NATURE PROGRAM INVITES KIDS AND THEIR CARETAKERS TO DON THEIR PAJAMAS AND LISTEN TO STORIES, MAKE A CRAFT AND THEN EXPLORE THE GROUNDS AT NIGHT.

OMAR KELLY DOLPHINS WRITER/COLUMNIST THE DOLPHINS' PLAYERS WILL TALK ABOUT EXECUTION AND BLAME THEMSELVES FOR SUNDAY'S FLAT PERFORMANCE. THEY WON'T POINT THE FINGER AT THEIR COACHING STAFF, OR BLAME THEIR STRUGGLES ON INJURIES. BUT MIAMI'S LACK OF HEART, DESIRE AND COMMITMENT IN THE HOME OPENER...READ THE STORY BUFFALO COACH REX RYAN SENT OUT FORMER DOLPHINSRICHIE INCOGNITO, CHARLES CLAY, DAN CARPENTER AND MARCUS THIGPEN FOR THE COIN TOSS AS HIS TEAM CAPTAINS (ALONG WITH FORMER UM STAR SEANTREL HENDERSON). IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THEM TO MAKE AN IMPACT. AFTER FORCING A THREE-AND-OUT TO OPEN THE GAME, THE BILLS (2-1) DROVE 77 YARDS ON FIVE PLAYSAND WENT AHEAD ON A 25-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS FROM TYROD TAYLOR TO CLAY. THE TIGHT END CLAY HAD THREE CATCHES ON THAT OPENING DRIVE FOR 58 YARDS AND FINISHED WITH FIVE GRABS FOR 82 YARDS. CARPENTER ADDED TWO FIRST-HALF FIELD GOALS, BOTH OF WHICH WERE SET UP BY TANNEHILL INTERCEPTIONS. TANNEHILL'S OTHER INTERCEPTION WASRETURNED 43 YARDS FOR A TOUCHDOWN BY BILLS LINEBACKER PRESTON BROWN. CCOMMENTS @JERRY1939 - IF THE DOLPHINS RELOCATED, NOTHING WOULD CHANGE. THE SUN WOULD STILL RISE, THE WEATHER WOULD STILL BE NICE, THE WAVES WOULD STILL RIPPLE INTO THE BEACH, ETC. BUT THE ONE THING THAT WOULD CHANGE WOULD BE THAT THE RESIDENTS NO LONGER HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE SAME OLD THREE MONTHS OF... FORTLAUDERDALENATIVE AT 8:55 PM SEPTEMBER 27, 2015 ADD A COMMENT SEE ALL COMMENTS 11 IT WAS THE THIRD STRAIGHT GAME THE DOLPHINS FELL BEHIND EARLY. "WE HAVEN'T STARTED THE GAME WELL, AND OBVIOUSLY THAT NEEDS TO GET FIXED -- AND IT NEEDS TO GET FIXED TOMORROW," TANNEHILL SAID. THE DOLPHINS (1-2) WERE OUTGAINED 200-39 BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT A SMATTERING OF BOOS. THEY BECAME LOUDER AS THE TEAM TROTTED INTO THE LOCKER ROOM AT HALFTIME DOWN BY 27. "OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT TO START A LITTLE FASTER, ELIMINATE BIG PLAYS AND GO FROM THERE," DEFENSIVE TACKLE NDAMUKONG SUH SAID. "THE LAST THREE GAMES, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DICTATING TO US, AND IT'S PUT US IN A TOUGH SPOT." THE DOLPHINS FINALLY MOUNTED A DRIVE IN THEIR FIRST POSSESSON OF THE SECOND HALF, GOING 56 YARDS ON SIX PLAYS AND SCORING ON A 21-YARD PASS FROM TANNEHILL TO RISHARD MATTHEWS. TANNEHILL HIT JARVIS LANDRY FOR A TWO-POINT CONVERSION TO MAKE IT 27-8. BUT ANOTHER FORMER DOLPHIN, EX-PRACTICE SQUAD RECEIVER CHRIS HOGAN, HELPED THE BILLS STRETCH THEIR LEAD AGAIN, PULLING DOWNA 38-YARD TD PASS FROM TAYLOR. MATTHEWS (6 CATCHES, 113 YARDS) HAULED IN ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN PASS ON A 46-YARD HEAVE FROM TANNEHILL WITH 7:56 REMAINING. BUT IT WAS ONLY WINDOW DRESSING, AND ROOKIE KICKER ANDREW FRANKS ADDED A BIT MORE EMBARRASSMENT BY MISSING THE ENSUING EXTRA POINT. ON THE SECOND SNAP AFTER A FAILED ONSIDE KICK, BILLS RUNNING BACK KARLOS WILLIAMS RACED 41 YARDS FOR ANOTHER BUFFALO SCORE. BY THAT POINT, THE BILLS HAD ALREADY PULLED TAYLOR FOR BACKUP EJ MANUEL. THE DOLPHINS WILL TRY ANOTHER CHANGE OF SCENERY NEXT WEEK, WHEN THEY TRAVEL 4,400 MILES TO LONDON TO FACE THE NEW YORK JETS. "I WISH WE WERE PLAYING BETTER, BUT WE ARE WHAT WE ARE RIGHT NOW," COACH JOE PHILBIN SAID. "THERE'S NO MAGIC POTION. IF THERE WAS A MAGIC POTION, I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT IT OUT ALREADY."

MISSOURI IS ON PACE FOR 40 PERCENT FEWER METH LAB SEIZURES THIS YEAR THAN LAST, ACCORDING TO MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL DATA. OKLAHOMA BUSTS ARE ON PACE TO DROP 33 PERCENT, WHILE TENNESSEES ARE DOWN 48 PERCENT. THE STEEP DECLINE DOESNT MEAN USERS ARE TURNING AWAY FROM THE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE DRUG.

ITS JUST THAT THEYVE SWITCHED SOURCES FROM COOKING IT TO IMPORTING IT. METH USE AND ADDICTION ARE STILL EPIDEMIC, HE SAID. THE NUMBER OF METH LAB SEIZURES NATIONWIDE PEAKED AT NEARLY 24,000 IN 2004. THE PROBLEM GOT SO BAD THAT RESTRICTIONS WERE PLACED ON THE SALE OF COLD AND ALLERGY PILLS CONTAINING PSEUDOEPHEDRINE, WHICH GETS MIXED WITH HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS LIKE LIGHTER FLUID OR DRAIN CLEANER TO MAKE HOMEMADE METH. THOSE MEDICATIONS WERE PLACED BEHIND THE COUNTER, WITH BUYING LIMITS AND TRACKING OF SALES. BY 2007, FEWER THAN 7,000 METH LABS WERE SEIZED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

WILLIAMS "I CALL IT MY ROCK 'N' ROLL INFERNO," TORCH SAYS. "BECAUSE I WORK THE CROWD. ... AND CATER TO RIDERS, MOTORCYCLE, MAINLY." WHEN HE ARRIVES, EVENT STAFF CLEAR OUT A 25-FOOT RADIUS FOR HIS PERFORMING AREA, WHICH IS NEVER ON STAGE, BUT IS SROMETIMES IN FRONT OF ONE. TORCH PREFERS TO BE ON THE GROUND, WITH HIS AUDIENCE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE THE NUANCES OF HIS DANGEROUS PERFORMANCE. THE RADIUS IS TO KEEP THE AUDIENCE SAFE FROM THE BIG AND FLASHY MOVES, SUCH AS THE 8- AND 10-FOOT FLAMES SHOT FROM HIS MOTORCYCLE, THE 30- AND 40-FOOT CURLS STEMMING FROM HIS FLAMETHROWER AND TO KEEP THEM A REASONABLE DISTANCE FROM THE TALL FLAMES HE BREATHES.  TWO RESEARCH ANALYSTS HAVE RATED THE STOCK WITH A HOLD RATING AND ELEVEN HAVE ASSIGNED A BUY RATING TO THE STOCK. TORCH ALSO USES AN ARRAY OF NUNCHUCKS, A BULLWHIP AND A FIRE STAFF (THAT LOOKS LIKE A BATON) TO SPIN, CRACK AND WIELD FIRE IN CIRCLES, ARCS AND OTHER SHAPES. "WHEN YOU SAY 'FIRE SHOW,' YOU PICTURE SOMEONE DOING A VERY SLOW PACE," TORCH SAYS. "MOST [FIRE PERFORMERS] ARE WEIRD LOOKING DUDES TRYING TO LOOK SEXY [WHILE PERFORMING]. THEY HAVE THEIR SHIRT OFF AND HAVE LONG HAIR OR HAVE GIRLS IN HULA HOOPS. "A LOT OF THE FIRE PERFORMERS DO ONE THING AT A SLOW PACE AND CAN DRAG IT OUT FOR 5 OR 10 MINUTES." BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU GET WITH HIS SHOW, BECAUSE HE'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE FIRE PERFORMER. "MINE HAS LOTS OF ENERGY, WORKING THE CROWD AND GETTING LOTS OF ENERGY GOING," HE SAYS. "IT'S MORE IN-YOUR-FACE ... TO GET THE WHOLE CROWD'S ATTENTION." RATHER THAN A BIG, LONG SET, TORCH WILL DO VARIOUS ACTS, USUALLY AT 30 SECONDS TO A MINUTE EACH. ONCE SOMETHING STOPS BEING INTERESTING, HE STOPS DOING IT. HE FEEDS ON THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CROWD AND EXERTS SO MUCH ENERGY WITH EACH PERFORMANCE THAT HE USUALLY FEELS SICK AFTERWARD, FROM ALL THE EFFORT SPENT AND THE HIGH DEMAND IT PUTS ON HIS BODY. WHILE DOING A SHOW, "TO PUMP UP ENERGY, I'LL BE RUNNING AROUND LIKE A MANIAC," HE SAYS. BUT THE TECHNIQUE OF EATING FIRE TAKES DISCIPLINE, INCLUDING HIGH CONTROL OF HIS BREATHING. GOING FULL THROTTLE TO AN INSTANT STOP MEANS A LOT OF PRACTICE. TORCH GOT HIS START IN 2009 WHEN HE LEARNED HOW TO USE BASIC FIRE PERFORMING EQUIPMENT FROM A FIRE-EATING GO-GO DANCER AT A DALLAS NIGHTCLUB, WHERE HE WORKED. AFTER A FEW 10- AND 15-MINUTE TEACHING SESSIONS, HE BOUGHT HIS OWN EQUIPMENT AND PERFORMED A COUPLE TIMES A NIGHT SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK. HE STARTED TOURING IN 2012 AND ENJOYS STAYING ON THE ROAD. IT KEEPS HIM CLOSE TO NATURE, GIVES HIM A WAY TO SEE THE COUNTRY AND INTRODUCES HIM TO WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A STELLAR GROUP OF PEOPLE. "ABOVE ALL, I'M A BIKER," HE SAYS ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE.  YOU GOTTA LOVE WHAT YOURE DOING WHEN YOURE IN THE SIXTH YEAR OF DOING IT, MIRAFLOR SAYS SMILING. "I LOVE MY BIKER BROTHERS AND SSTERS AND WHAT WE REPQRESENT, WHICH IS GREAT CAUSES." IT INFLUENCES THE VENUES HE PICKS FOR PERFORMANCE, WHICH INCLUDE PLENTY OF BIKER RALLIES. "YOU BECOME FAMILY WITH A LOT OF [PEOPLE] AT THESE RALLIES," HE SAYS. "BIKERS ARE A CLOSE KNIT GROUP OF PEOPLE. A LOT GOES INTO THESE RALLIES [INCLUDING] A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE." NAN WHAT'S UP ON 09/25/2

63	EACH DAY WE SEE THE EFFORT OF UNIONS TO FORCE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY FARM WORKERS TO PAY BRIBES TO WORK. THEN YOU HAVE THE EFFORT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES ARE FORCING WORKERS TO SPEND MORE ON WORKING CONDITIONS. THEN YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR FARMS, ESPECIALLY IF PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. THE SOLUTION IS ROBOTS AND MACHINES TO DO THE PICKING AND HARVESTING OF CROPS. WHILE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE RESEARCH NEEDED THE NEW MACHINES, THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SO. YEARS AGO UC DAVIS DEVELOPED A TOMATO PICKING MACHINEBUT THE UNIONS STOPPED ITS DEVELOPMENT. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. AGAIN, AMERICA CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN AGRICULTURE INTERNATIONALLY. WE CAN INNOVATE AND FEED THE HUNGRY MASSES BY MAKING FOOD AVAILABILITY MORE RELIABLE AND LOW COST. CROPS FARMERS WISH THEY HAD ROBOTS ELIZA BARCLAY, KPBS, 9/7/15 THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION SAYS MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO PICK HOT AND BELL PEPPERS COULD HELP SOLVE LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEMS. IF YOURE ENJOYING A LATE-SUMMER FRUIT PIE THIS LABOR DAY, CONSIDER WHAT WENT INTO GROWING AND HARVESTING THAT FRUIT.  ) JUST WHEN I THINK IVE HEARD EVERY BAD REASON FOR TAKING SOCIAL SECURITY EARLY, ANOTHER ONE POPS UP. CHANCES ARE, IT TOOK A LOT OF HUMAN HANDS TO ENSURE ITS SKIN WOULD BE PERFECT AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. WHILE MACHINES HAVE REPLACED HUMAN HANDS FOR A LOT OF FARM JOBS THE HARVESTING OF TOMATOES FOR PROCESSING, THE CUTTING OF LETTUCE AND SPINACH, THE SHAKING OF ALMOND TREES TO MAKE THE NUTS FALL TO THE GROUND MANY FRUIT, VEGETABLE AND NUT FARMERS STILL RELY HEAVILY ON PEOPLE TO PLANT, MAINTAIN AND HARVEST THEIR CROPS.  ONE OF OUR MARES HERE RUBS VALVE ON HER AUTOMATIC WATERER AND UNTIL WE MOVE IT UP HIGHER ON THE WALL WE HAVE TO CHECK TWICE A DAY TO MAKE SHE SHE HASNT RUBBED IT INTO THE OFF POSITION. MACHINES DONT YET EXIST FOR THESE CROPS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN AMPLE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK, AND BECAUSE ITS HARD TO DESIGN MACHINES THAT CAN CUT OR PICK THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLES WITHOUT SQUISHING OR DAMAGING THEM TOO MUCH. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. ALL THATS CREATED A NEW PUSH FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO MECHANIZATION TO REPLACE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME FILLING. THERES AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF FRESH-MARKET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS, MATTHEW WHITING , AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND EXTENSION SPECIALIST AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEET CHERRY INDUSTRY, TELLS THE SALT. THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED HARVEST LABOR IS ON EVERY GROWERS MIND. FOR LABOR DAY, WE THOUGHT WED ROUND UP SOME OF THE CROPS THAT CANT YET BE HARVESTED BY A MACHINE, BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE FUTURE. TO BE CLEAR, THE ISSUE OF FARM LABOR IS COMPLICATED. AND MACHINES THAT COULD HARVEST THESE CROPS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE. SWEET CHERRIES THESE ARE THE SOFT, SWEET CHERRIES WE GET IN BAGS WITH THE STEM ATTACHED. AND WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND PLUMP? BECAUSE A HUMAN HAND CAREFULLY PICKED THEM. BUT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER WILLING HANDS TO DO THAT WORK. AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTICED. OF ALL THE PRODUCERS THAT DREAM OF MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO EASE THEIR LABOR WOES, THE SWEET CHERRY GROWERS MIGHT BE THE CLOSEST TO GETTING ONE THANKS TO RESEARCH FUNDING. MATT WHITING SAYS HE AND OTHERS AT WSU ARE CLOSE TO FINDING A COMMERCIAL PARTNER FOR A PROTOTYPE HARVESTER THAT CAN PICK 50 TIMES AS MANY CHERRIES AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD IN THE SAME TIME. STILL, THERES ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS NEW MODEL IS VIABLE: NEW VARIETIES OF CHERRIES SUITED TO THE MECHANICAL HARVESTER WILL NEED TO BE BRED. WHITING SAYS RESEARCH IS HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT IN 10 TO 12 YEARS, SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER GROWERS A SUITE OF NEW VARIETIES. ASPARAGUS AS THE HUFFINGTON POST HAS REPORTED , ASPARAGUS IS UNIQUELY LABOR INTENSIVE BECAUSE THE QUICK-GROWING PLANT MUST BE HARVESTED EVERY DAY OF ITS THREE-MONTH GROWING SEASON. EACH PLANT SPROUTS MULTIPLE SPEARS (THE PART OF THE PLANT WE EAT) A DAY, WHICH HAVE TO BE HAND-CUT EVERY DAY.  BUT VARIOUS MECHANICAL ASPARAGUS HARVESTERS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING THEM. ACCORDING TO A 2509 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT , IF THE U.S. ASPARAGUS INDUSTRY IS TO INSURE A COMPETITIVE POSITION, IT MUST SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGY FOR LABOR TO LOWER PER UNIT COSTS AND SHIFT THE WORKFORCE TO VALUE-ADDED EMPLOYMENT. INSTITUTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW. APPLES COMMERCIAL APPLE PICKING TODAY REQUIRES BRAWN TO FILL BUCKETS LONG APPLES AND THEN DUMP THEM INTO BINS. AND ACCORDING TO A FRUIT INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION , THE ERA OF FULLY AUTOMATED ROBOTIC HARVESTERS NAVIGATING [APPLE] ORCHARD ROWS IS STILL YEARS AWAY. WHITING SAYS THATS BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS DEDICATED LITTLE FUNDING DEDICATED TO RESEARCH. THATS CHANGING, THOUGH. THE WASHINGTON STATE TREE FRUIT RESEARCH COMMISSION IS NOW PURSUING MORE RESEARCH ON MECHANICAL HARVESTING. AND THIS YEAR, SOME COMMERCIAL APPLE FARMERS MAY BE USING A VACUUM HARVESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME. ITS DESIGNERS SAY IT SAVES TIME, REDUCES PICKER FATIGUE AND BOOST THE HARVEST YIELD. PEPPERS CALIFORNIA GROWS ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE PEPPERS IN THE U.S., AND LATELY THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION HAS BEEN TALKING MORE DEVELOPING MECHANICAL HARVESTING AND VARIETIES BRED TO BE PICKED BY MACHINES. ACCORDING TO A 2015 REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION, WITH INCREASING COST AND DECREASING AVAILABILITY NEEDED TO PICK PEPPERS, INNOVATION [SIMILAR TO THE PROCESSED TOMATO INDUSTRY] COULD GIVE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. FARMERS SIGNIFICANT RETURNS AND POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PEPPER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA, THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO MARKET QUALITY AND MECHANICAL HARVESTING IN BOTH BLOCKY [BELL PEPPERS] AND HOT TYPES.

64	A STATE-OF-THE-ART JOBS WEBSITE WILL HELP MATCH JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS, THE TNAISTE AND MINISTER FOR SOCIAL PROTECTION, JOAN BURTON T.D., HAS SAID. THE TNAISTE TODAY (FRIDAY, 18 SEPTEMBER 2015) ANNOUNCED THAT THE CONTRACT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF THE NEW JOBSIRELAND.IE WEBSITE HAS BEEN AWARDED TO BDO IRELAND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AN IRISH TECH START-UP - THE HIRE LAB BASED IN CARRIGALINE, CO. CORK. THE CONTRACT WHICH IS VALUED AT SOME 4.5M WILL LEAD TO THE CREATION OF UP TO 25 HIGH SKILLED JOBS IN THE HIRE LAB AND WILL DELIVER A FREE, CUTTING-EDGE RECRUITMENT AND EMPLOYMENT WEBSITE FOR USE BY JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS THROUGHOUT IRELAND. THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE IN THE PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL ROOM AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK, IN THE PRESENCE OF UCC VICE PRESIDENT, CAROLINE FENNELL. THE EXISTING JOBSIRELAND.IE WEBSITE, FIRST DEVELOPED IN THE LATE 1990S, IS THE LARGEST SUCH WEBSITE IN USE IN IRELAND WITH ALMOST 100,000 JOBS ADVERTISED IN 2014. ITS REPLACEMENT WILL IMPROVE SERVICES FOR JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS, INCLUDING: ENABLING JOBSEEKERS TO SUBMIT CVS AND APPLY FOR JOBS ON-LINE. ENABLING BOTH EMPLOYERS AND JOBSEEKERS TO SEARCH FOR EACH OTHER USING COMPETENCIES AND SKILLSETS. OPERATING IN THE BACKGROUND TO AUTOMATICALLY MATCH CANDIDATE CVS TO JOB SPECIFICATIONS POSTED BY EMPLOYERS, AND NOTIFYING CANDIDATES AND THE EMPLOYER WHEN SUCH A MATCH IS FOUND. INTEGRATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTIONS INTREO SERVICE IN SUPPORT OF PROGRAMMES SUCH AS COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT AND TS. THE TNAISTE SAID: TODAY IS ABOUT UNLOCKING POTENTIAL - ABOUT TRANSFORMING JOBSIRELAND.IE INTO A CUTTING-EDGE SERVICE THAT WILL BENEFIT BOTH JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE AS WE SPEED UP PROGRESS IN TACKLING UNEMPLOYMENT. ITS ABOUT UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY PERSON ON THE LIVE REGISTER TO RETURN TO WORK AND BUILD A BETTER FINANCIAL FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES, AND THEIR FAMILIES, OVER TIME. THE GOVERNMENT IS DRIVING A JOBS-LED RECOVERY THAT IS NOW ADDING 1,300 JOBS A WEEK, AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN BY A THIRD SINCE ITS CRISIS PEAK. BUT WEVE MORE TO DO. AND BDO IRELAND AND THE HIRE LAB WILL HELP US DO THAT THROUGH THIS VERY IMPORTANT CONTRACT. COMMENTING ON THE PROJECT, DERRY GRAY FROM BDO IRELAND STATED HIS DELIGHT THAT THE INNOVATIVE APPROACH PROPOSED BY THE COLLABORATION OF BDO AND THE HIRE LAB, WAS SELECTED AS THE PREFERRED BIDDER. THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE OF BDO AND THE HIRE LAB, IS A COLLABORATION OF TWO INDIGENOUS IRISH BUSINESSES, WHO WILL PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH A 21ST CENTURY SOLUTION TO THEIR JOBS AND RECRUITMENT PLATFORM. BEING AWARDED THIS CONTRACT IS A POSITIVE ENDORSEMENT OF IRISH INNOVATION IN THIS EXCITING AREA. OUR TEAM LOOKS FORWARD TO DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISE TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH A SOLUTION THAT NOT ONLY SATISFIES BUT EXCEEDS ITS TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS NEEDS. MAURICE BUCKLEY, CEO OF THE HIRE LAB COMMENTED, "WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTION ON SUCH A STRATEGIC PROJECT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DEPLOYING OUR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENTS' JOBS MATCHING AND VACANCY SERVICE. SECURING A PROJECT LIKE THIS, ALLOWS US TO CREATE 25 HIGHLY SKILLED POSITIONS DOUBLING OUR WORKFORCE IN CORK OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS." ENDS NOTE FOR EDITORS ABOUT JOBSIRELAND AND THE NEW SERVICE WWW.JOBSIRELAND.IE IS A FREE ONLINE JOBS SITE DEVELOPED IN THE LATE 1990S THAT ENABLES EMPLOYERS TO POST JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBSEEKERS TO SEARCH AND APPLY FOR THESE OPPORTUNITIES ONLINE. IT IS THE LARGEST SUCH WEBSITE IN USE IN IRELAND WITH OVER 25,000 JOBS AVAILABLE AT ANY ONE TIME. THE NEW SERVICE, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO GO LIVE BY THE END OF MARCH 2016, WILL UPGRADE THE EXISTING JOBSIRELAND.IE SERVICE AND WILL INTRODUCE ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY TO THE BENEFIT OF JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS. THE CURRENT JOBSIRELAND.IE SERVICE ENABLES JOBSEEKERS TO SEARCH FOR JOB OPPORTUNITIES BASED ON JOB TYPE, LOCATION AND SALARY. EMPLOYERS HOWEVER CANNOT SEARCH FOR SUITABLE JOBSEEKERS THEY HAVE TO RELY ON CANDIDATES FINDING AND APPLYING FOR THEIR JOB FROM AMONG THE MANY THOUSANDS HOSTED ON THE SYSTEM. THE NEW SERVICE WILL ENABLE BOTH EMPLOYERS AND JOBSEEKERS TO SEARCH FOR EACH OTHER USING COMPETENCIES AND SKILLSETS AS WELL AS THE TRADITIONAL JOB TYPE CLASSIFICATIONS. IT WILL ALSO OPERATE IN THE BACKGROUND TO AUTOMATICALLY MATCH CANDIDATE CVS TO JOB SPECIFICATIONS POSTED BY EMPLOYERS AND NOTIFY CANDIDATES AND THE EMPLOYER WHEN A MATCH IS FOUND. THE SYSTEM WILL ALSO ENABLE JOBSEEKERS TO SUBMIT CVS AND APPLY FOR JOBS ON-LINE AND WILL INTEGRATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTIONS INTREO SERVICE IN SUPPORT OF PROGRAMMES SUCH AS COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT, TS AND JOBBRIDGE, AND WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENTS CASE WORKERS TO TRACK AND SUPPORT JOBSEEKER EMPLOYMENT SEARCH ACTIVITY.

66	ONE OF THE FEW POSITIONAL UNITS THAT PLAYED WITH MIDSEASON POLISH DURING MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL S SLOPPY LATE GAME BETWEEN THE VIKINGS AND 49ERS WAS THE SAN FRANCISCOOFFENSIVE LINE THAT PAVED THE WAY FOR CARLOS HYDE S 168 YARD, TWO-TOUCHDOWN BREAKOUT PERFORMANCE. LIKE MOST GROUPS ON THE 49ERS ROSTER, THE OFFENSIVE LINE UNDERWENT A WORLD OF CHANGE THIS OFF-SEASON. AFTER A POOR PRESEASON, MANY QUESTIONED WHETHER THIS NEW-LOOK GROUP WOULD EVER COME CLOSE TO MATCHING THE DOMINANT OFFENSIVE LINES THE 49ERS FIELDED FOR SO MUCH OF THE PAST FOUR OR FIVE SEASONS. FOR ONE WEEK, ANYHOW, THEY DID. ONE OF THE FEW CONSTANTS OF THE 49ERS' OFFENSIVE LINE, AND THE ROSTER AS A WHOLE, IS LEFT TACKLE JOE STALEY , WHO IS AMONG THE LEAGUES BEST AT HIS POSITION. STALEY, A FIRST-ROUND PICK BY SAN FRANCISCO IN 2007, HAS BEEN NAMED TO THE PRO BOWL IN EACH OF THE PAST FOUR SEASONS. HES ALSO A STALWART IN THE LOCKER ROOM, KNOWN FOR HIS UNIQUE BRAND OF LEADERSHIP AND LEVITY.

HE HAS SO MUCH TALENT AND GREAT VISION AND WHAT WERE DOING SCHEMATICALLY REALLY FITS HIS STRENGTHS. HE SAID HE FELT LIKE HE WAS BACK OUT THERE AT OHIO STATE, AND WHAT HE DID THERE IS WHY WE DRAFTED HIM. YOU ALL GOT A GLIMPSE OF WHAT WE SAW THE WHOLE OFF-SEASON. IT WASNT TOO SURPRISING FOR US BUT FOR EVERYONE ELSE, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT. MJ: YOU MENTIONED SCHEMATICS. WHAT IN [OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR] GEEP CHRYSTS PLAYBOOK IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL, AND DO YOU FORESEE MORE OF A COMMITMENT TO THE GROUND GAME THIS YEAR? JS: EVERY GAME IS ITS OWN THING. ITS NOTHING WELL DO EVERY WEEK. BUT MONDAY WAS A REAL CREDIT TO OUR DEFENSE AND GAVE US THE PATIENCE TO STICK WITH OUR GAME PLAN, WHICH WAS REALLY TO ESTABLISH THE RUN. YOU SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE GET IN TROUBLE WITH THAT DEFENSIVE FRONT. WE WERE ABLE TO STICK WITH THE RUN AND THE TEMPO SO WE DEFINITELY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE. MJ: HOW DIFFICULT WAS THE OFF-SEASON IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH VIRTUALLY EVERY MEDIA MEMBER DECIDING YOU WOULD BE TERRIBLE AND MOCKING YOUR CHOICE OF A NEW HEAD COACH? JS: I HONESTLY DONT PAY MUCH ATTENTION. BUT THATS KIND OF EXPECTED. YOU HAVE A LOT OF TURNOVER, A NEW HEAD COACH. AUTOMATICALLY EVERYONE THINKS THE SKY IS FALLING. WHAT WE WORRY ABOUT AS A TEAM ARE THE PEOPLE HERE EVERY DAY PUTTING IN THE WORK AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE HERE AND WIN GAMES. THATS THE FOCUS. MJ: OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUR OLD COACH AND YOU NEW ONE, DIFFERENCES THAT PROBABLY SPAN SEVERAL CATEGORIES. TO YOU, WHATS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JIM HARBAUGH AND JIM TOMSULA? JS: THEY BOTH HAVE A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE, AND THEYRE BOTH GREAT HEAD COACHES. I DONT WANT TO GET INTO THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF EITHER, BUT IM PLAYING FOR COACH TOMSULA RIGHT NOW. HES DONE A GREAT JOB MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE FRESH GOING INTO WEEK 1. IF YOU LOOKED AT OUR INJURY REPORT GOING INTO WEEK 1 WE ONLY HAD ONE GUY LISTED, AND HE DRESSED AND PLAYED. THATS A TRIBUTE TO HOW COACH TOMSULA APPROACHED THE OFF-SEASON, TAKING CARE OF GUYS' BODIES AND MAKING SURE THEY GOT ENOUGH REPS TO WHERE THEY WERE READY BUT GOING INTO THE SEASON FRESH.TOMSULA DOES A GREAT JOB COMMUNICATING WITH THE GUYS AND LEANING ON THE VETERANS. HES REALLY RECEPTIVE TO THE VETERAN DUDES AND TAKES A LOT OF FEEDBACK, TOO, WHICH IS NICE. NOT TO SAY THAT HARBAUGH DIDNT DO THAT ALL, BECAUSE HE DID, BUT ITS ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF JIMMY. HES A PLAYERS GUY AND HAS A LOT OF GUYS HE TRUSTS. BUT YOU HAVE TO EARN THAT TRUST. MJ: LEADING INTO THE PRESEASON THEMMQB RAN A GREAT, IN-DEPTH TOMSULA STORY THAT COVERED A LOT OF BASES. STILL, TELL US ONE THING ABOUT JIMMY T WE DONT ALREADY KNOW. JS: HIS FIRST YEAR WAS MY FIRST YEAR. HE WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST LOVED COACHES FOR THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS HERE. HE ALREADY HAS THAT RESPECT, THE ADMIRATION. HES ONE OF THE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE GUYS, ONE OF THE MOST PASSIONATE AND HE DOESNT THINK ABOUT FOOTBALL THE WAY A TYPICAL COACH DOES. HE THINKS ABOUT IT MORE AS A PLAYER. HE UNDERSTANDS THE PASSION AND EMOTION. AND HE UNDERSTANDS THE MENTAL ASPECT. MJ : IN JULY, YOU MADE AN EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE JOE SHOW , THE INTERNET SMASH WHERE YOU ASK TEAMMATES STUPID QUESTIONS IS RETURNING AFTER A TWO-YEAR HIATUS. JS: MAYBE. MJ: MAYBE? JS: I HAD TOYED WITH IT COMING BACK BUT I MAY KEEP IT ON THE SHELF FOR A WHILE. CONSIDER THIS A TEASER. I WANT TO KEEP EVERYONE ON THEIR TOES. MJ: BE HONEST. ARE YOU SHELVING YOUR SHOW BECAUSE JARRYD HAYNE IS SUCH A HARD GET THESE DAYS? JS: IM PRETTY SURE IF I HAD MY SHOW I COULD GET JARRYD. [LAUGHS.] MJ: DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO CHECK OUT THE GUARDIANS LIVE BLOG OF YOUR GAME? JS: I DID AND IT WAS HILARIOUS. I LOVED HOW HE DIDNT UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE SO MANY COMMERCIALS. MJ: OK, JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK-HIT QUESTIONS. WHO ARE THE TOP THREE LEFT TACKLES IN THE NFL? JS: JOE THOMAS AND JASON PETERS ARE THE TWO GUYS WHO REALLY COME TO MIND. ID LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS ONE OF THE TOP BUT I ALSO THINK THATS KIND OF VAIN TO TALK ABOUT YOURSELF THAT WAY. I REALLY ADMIRE THOSE GUYS AND ONE OF THE YOUNG GUYS THINK WILL BE GOOD FOR A REALLY LONG TIME IS TAYLOR LEWAN , THE LEFT TACKLE FOR THE TITANS . I LOVE WATCHING HIM ON FILM. MJ: IF YOU WERE NFL COMMISSIONER FOR A DAY, WHATS YOUR FIRST CHANGE? JS: I WOULD HIRE AN OUTSIDE DISCIPLINARY COUNCIL. MJ: ON A SCALE OF 110, HOW MUCH DO YOU MISS CANDLESTICK PARK? JS: THATS A LOADED QUESTION. ILL PASS ON THAT ONE. [LAUGHS.] MJ: THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO ANSWER MY LAST QUESTION, WHICH IS HOW WOULD YOU RANK YOUR ALTERNATIVE BLACK UNIFORMS ON A SCALE OF HIDEOUS TO RIDICULOUSLY HIDEOUS? JS: I LOVED THEM. I THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT. I DONT KNOW WHY EVERYONE WAS HATING ON THEM.

67	THE NEWS IS FROM JULY, BUTYESTERDAY WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HEARD THATA DIETARY SUPPLEMENT CALLED IRON DREAM , A SUPPLEMENT DESIGNED TO HELP AID SLEEP AND POST-WORKOUT RECOVERY MANUFACTURED BY MUSCLEPHARM , WAS PULLED FROM SHELVES IN EUROPEAFTER AUTHORITIES CLAIMED THAT THE PRODUCT CONTAINED 2,4-DINITROPHENOL, AKADNP (SOURCE: FORBES ). TO NO SURPRISE, THE COMPANY CLAIMED THAT THE SUSPECTED SUPPLEMENTS WERE COUNTERFEIT . DNP IS NOT SOMETHING TO SCREW WITH. ITS A HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICAL THAT WAS ONCE USED IN DIET PILLS DUE TO ITS ABILITY TO GREATLY INCREASE METABOLIC RATE THROUGH INCREASED HEAT PRODUCTION BY THE BODY. UNFORTUNATELY, ITS TOO GOOD, SO MUCH SO THAT EVEN A SLIGHT OVERDOSE CAN LEAD TO A COMBINATION OF HYPERTHERMIA, TACHYCARDIA, DIAPHORESIS AND TACHYPNOEA, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO DEATH. DESPITE THE RISK, PEOPLE STILL USE IT AND SOME DIE . UNDISCLOSED INGREDIENTS IN SUPPLEMENTS HAS BEEN ONE OF MANY PROBLEMS IN THE LARGELY UNREGULATED DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS INDUSTRY. WHAT CONCERNS ME MORE WITH THIS SPECIFIC CASE IS WHERE THE DNP WAS FOUND. OBVIOUSLY, IT DOESNT BELONG ANYWHERE NEAR THE HUMAN BODY, BUTMY EXPECTATION IS THAT A CHEMICAL KNOWN FOR AIDING WEIGHT LOSS WOULD BE USED IN A SUPPLEMENT GEARED TOWARD WEIGHT LOSS. MY BELIEF IS THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN NOT TAKE MORE THAN THE RECOMMENDED DOSES OF WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING BAD SIDE EFFECTS DUE THE HIGH AMOUNT OF STIMULANTS. THEREFORE, IF TRACE AMOUNTS OF DNP ARE IN A WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT, THERE IS LESS OF A CHANCE OF INGESTING A FATAL DOSE. IRON DREAM IS NOT A WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT. IT IS A NIGHT TIME SUPPLEMENT THAT CLAIMS TO AID IN RECOVERY AND MUSCLE GROWTH WHILE SLEEPING. IT IS A COMBINATION OF VITAMINS, HERBS,AND AMINO ACIDS. ITS ALSO A PRETTY SMALL SERVING SIZE (ANOTHER PROBLEM IN THIS INDUSTRY). MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS THAT PEOPLE COULD EASILY TAKE TWO TO THREE TIMES WHATS ON THE LABEL WITHOUT EXPERIENCING ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS, THAT IS, UNLESS ITS SPIKED WITH SOMETHING LIKE DNP. WHILE THE ADULTERATED PRODUCT WAS LIKELY A COUNTERFEIT, ITS A GOOD REMINDER OF CAVEAT EMPTOR, ESPECIALLY WHEN PURCHASING PRODUCTS THROUGH INTERNET-BASED BUSINESSES.
68	PROCTER & GAMBLE ( PG ) SHARES HAVE NOT LOOKED PRETTY IN 2015. YEAR TO DATE, PG STOCK HAS LOST 23% OF ITS VALUE. IN THE LAST 60 DAYS, THERE HAVE BEEN 8 NEGATIVE EARNINGS ESTIMATE REVISIONS BY ANALYSTS FOR THIS QUARTER. OUR EARNINGS CONSENSUS HAS BEEN DROPPING DOWN OVER THE LAST 90 DAYS AS WELL, GOING FROM $1.04 TO $0.96. SALES ARE PROJECTED TO DECLINE BY -7.5% THIS YEAR. EPS IS PROJECTED TO SHRINK BY -2.97%. WHATS WORSE IS THE FACT THAT PG HOLDS A ZACKS RANK #4 (SELL). CLEARLY, PG DOESNT LOOK LIKE AN IDEAL INVESTMENT PROSPECT RIGHT NOW. IF YOUVE BEEN A VICTIM OF PG SHARES, LOOK FOR SOME ZACKS RANK #1 (STRONG BUY) STOCKS TO DO YOUR PORTFOLIO SOME GOOD. BELOW, WE OUTLINE THREE ZACKS RANK #1 (STRONG BUY) CONSUMER STOCKS WHICH LOOK LIKE FAVORABLE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT NOW. THE SALES IN EACH OF THESE COMPANIES ARE PROJECTED TO GROW BY AT LEAST 10% THIS YEAR. ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE SEEN THEIR EPS CONSENSUS ESTIMATE MOVING UP OVER THE LAST 90 DAYS AS WELL. EACH OF THESE COMPANIES ARE ALSO PROJECTED TO SEE THEIR EPS GROW BY AT LEAST 30% THIS YEAR. AMERICAN WOODMARK CORPORATION- AMWD AMERICAN WOODMARK MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS KITCHEN CABINETS AND VANITIES. THE COMPANY SELLS FRAMED STOCK CABINETS FROM OVER 100 DIFFERENT CABINET LINES. ITS STOCK HOLDS A ZACKS RANK #1 (STRONG BUY). THE COMPANY HAS SOME CONSIDERABLE GROWTH CHARACTERISTICS. IT HAS A CURRENT RATIO OF 3.28. ITS EPS IS PROJECTED TO GROW BY 32.38% THIS YEAR. IT HAS AN ROE OF 17.88% AND A LOW DEBT TO CAPITAL OF 7.87%. AMWD HAS SALES TO ASSETS OF 2.19, AND SALES ARE PROJECTED TO GROW BY 10.36% THIS YEAR. IN THE LAST 60 DAYS, FOUR ANALYSTS HAVE REVISED THEIR EARNINGS ESTIMATES FOR THIS QUARTER. ALL OF THOSE ESTIMATES WERE REVISED UPWARDS. 90 DAYS AGO, OUR CONSENSUS ESTIMATED EARNINGS OF $0.60 PER SHARE FOR THIS QUARTER. OUR CONSENSUS HAS MOVED UP SINCE THEN, AND CURRENTLY ESTIMATES EARNINGS OF $0.70 PER SHARE FOR THIS QUARTER. AMERICAN WOODMARK HAS BEATEN OUR EARNINGS CONSENSUS ESTIMATE IN EACH OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS. THE CORPORATION REPORTS ITS EARNINGS ON 11/24/15. SKECHERS U.S.A.- SKX SKECHERS MAKES CASUAL AND ACTIVE SHOES FOR ALL AGES AND GENDERS. THE SHOE MANUFACTURER HAS A ZACKS RANK #1 (STRONG BUY). IT ALSO HAS A BETA OF 0.44, SO ITS NOT GOING TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME AMOUNT OF VOLATILITY AS YOUR TYPICAL STOCK. SKECHERS EPS IS PROJECTED TO GROW BY 77.59% THIS YEAR. IT HAS A CURRENT RATIO OF 2.53 AND DEBT TO CAPITAL OF 0.12%. SALES TO ASSETS ARE 1.63. SKECHERS HAS AN ROE OF 18%. ITS SALES ARE PROJECTED TO GROW BY 31.12% THIS YEAR. 90 DAYS AGO, OUR EPS CONSENSUS FOR THIS QUARTER WAS $1.53. NOW, OUR CONSENSUS ESTIMATES EARNINGS OF $1.62 PER SHARE.

IN THAT SAME AMOUNT OF TIME, ONLY ONE ANALYST REVISED THEIR ESTIMATE LOWER. 3 MONTHS AGO, OUR EPS CONSENSUS FOR THIS QUARTER WAS -$0.59. IT HAS MOVED UP, AND OUR CONSENSUS NOW ESTIMATES A LOSS OF -$0.12. AMAZON HAS BEATEN OUR EARNINGS CONSENSUS IN THREE OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS, WITH AN AVERAGE BEAT OF 72.93% PER QUARTER OVER THOSE FOUR QUARTERS. ITS WORTH NOTING THAT AMAZON BEAT OUR EARNINGS CONSENSUS ESTIMATE BY 226.67% LAST QUARTER. AMAZON REPORTS ITS EARNINGS ON 10/22/15. THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL WHICH TOLD ME THAT PROCTER & GAMBLE (PG) IS NOT ON MY SHOPPING LIST IS THE ZACKS RANK IT HOLDS. THE ZACKS RANK IS A TRULY MARVELOUS TRADING TOOL.

69	STEAMCRAFT BY JAMIE HARDY IS A STEAMPUNK ROLE PLAYING GAME SYSTEM AND SETTING PUBLISHED BY PERILOUS JOURNEYS PUBLISHING. THE SETTING IS THE FICTIONAL ONE OF TELLUS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN IT AN EARTH. THIS SUPPLEMENT IS AVAILABLE AS A 217 PAGE PDF WHICH NORMALLY COSTS $14.99 ON RPGNOW, BUT WAS PURCHASED AT AN OFFER PRICE OF ONLY $4.50. OF THE BOOK, ONE PAGE IS THE COVER, THERE IS A ONE PAGE SETTING MAP, THREE PAGES FOR THE STEAMCRAFT CHARACTER SHEET, TWO PAGES OF WEAPONS TABLES, ONE PAGE FRONT MATTER AND ONE PAGE TABLE OF CONTENTS. THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE ALL BLACK AND WHITE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FULL COLOUR FRONT COVER; THE MAJORITY OF THE PAGES INSIDE THE BOOK HAVE A DECORATIVE STEAMPUNK BORDER. THE BOOK IS NOT DIVIDED INTO NUMBERED CHAPTERS AS SUCH, ALTHOUGH IT IS DIVIDED INTO SOMETHING FAIRLY EQUIVALENT. SOME OF THESE COULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE GROUPED TOGETHER INTO VARIOUS SECTIONS. THE INTRODUCTION INTRODUCES STEAMPUNK, STEAMCRAFT, ROLE PLAYING GAMES IN GENERAL AND WHAT IS NEEDED TO PLAY THEM. THE FIRST PART OF THE BOOK CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE THE SETTING. THIS PART STARTS WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, DIVIDED INTO ARCADIAN COAST, GRANITE VALLEY, BADLANDS, CENTRAL SAVANNAH, NORTHERN LAURENTIA, ANATOLIA AND CYMURIA. OF THESE LOCATIONS, THE LATTER THREE ARE PART OF THE GLOBAL WORLD SETTING, WHILST THE OTHERS COMPRISE THE UNCHARTED TERRITORIES, WHICH IS THE AREA IN WHICH PLAYERS WILL BE ADVENTURING. THE UNCHARTED TERRITORIES ARE COVERED IN VARIOUS LEVELS OF DETAIL, WITH THE MOST BEING THE ARCADIAN COAST, THE PRIMARY CIVILISED REGION THAT WILL BE VISITED. ALSO IN THE SETTING PART ARE SOCIETY, THE FAE, RELIGION AND NOTEWORTHY GUILDS & ASSOCIATIONS. THESE ARE LARGELY SELF-EXPLANATORY, COVERING VARIOUS NON-HUMAN RACES, THE STATE OF TECHNOLOGY, WHICH INCLUDES COMPUTER PROGRAMMING AND A SORT OF VERY PRIMITIVE AND LIMITED, EARLY EQUIVALENT OF THE INTERNET, AS THE MECHANICAL COMPUTERS CAN COMMUNICATE OVER TELEGRAPH WIRES, AS WELL AS THE FOUR MAJOR RELIGIONS AND ORGANISATIONS THAT PLAYERS COULD ENCOUNTER. THE SECOND PART OF THE BOOK IS THE STEAMCRAFT GAME ITSELF. THIS STARTS WITH CHARACTER CREATION, EQUIPMENT AND PRICES, AN EXAMPLE OF CREATING A CHARACTER AND VARIOUS ARCHETYPES. GAME PLAY, NAMELY EXPERIENCE POINTS, FATE POINTS AND COMBAT, IS NEXT. THE BOOK THEN CONTINUES WITH VARIOUS RULES ON TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC, WITH SPELLS FOR DIFFERENT MAGICAL TYPES, AND HOW TO CREATE NEW ITEMS AND INVENTIONS, AND A SECTION ON SHIPS, PRIMARILY AIRSHIPS. THE SECOND PART FINISHES OFF WITH HOW TO RUN A GAME AND A BESTIARY OF VARIOUS RACES AND CREATURES. FINALLY, THERE IS THE APPENDIX, WHICH HAS SOME ADVANCED COMBAT RULES, WHICH ARE BOTH MORE REALISTIC AND DEADLIER, AS WELL AS WEAPONS DAMAGE CHARTS, THE CHARACTER SHEET AND THE SETTING MAP, WHICH COVERS THE UNCHARTED TERRITORIES. STEAMCRAFT IN REVIEW THE PDF LACKS BOOKMARKS; HOWEVER, THE INDEX IN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS IS CLICKABLE, WHICH MAKES UP FOR THIS, ALTHOUGH BOTH WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER. THE COVER ILLUSTRATION IS MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THE INTERNAL ONES; THE COVER LOOKS LIKE IT HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED, WHILST THE INTERIOR ILLUSTRATIONS GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING STOCK ART. THROUGHOUT THE BOOK ARE ALSO VARIOUS NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, WHICH GIVE BACKGROUND TO THE EVENTS AND SOCIETY OF THE SETTING, BY DESCRIBING EVENTS AND BY THE INCLUSION OF ADVERTS. THE STEAMCRAFT GAME SYSTEM IS A D100 BASED SYSTEM AND IS FAIRLY EASY TO UNDERSTAND; MOST TASKS REQUIRE ROLLING UNDER THE REQUIRED, POSSIBLY MODIFIED, NUMBER USING A D100. THE EXPERIENCE SYSTEM IS RATHER ODD, NOT SO MUCH IN HOW IT IS USED AS IN HOW EXPERIENCE POINTS ARE EARNED. EXPERIENCE POINTS ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE CHARACTER, BUT IT'S THE METHOD OF EARNING THE POINTS THAT IS A BIT STRANGE. THE BOOK SUGGESTS AWARDING 20 EXPERIENCE POINTS PER HOUR OF GAME PLAY, AND THIS REWARD IS NOT RELATED AT ALL TO WHAT A CHARACTER MIGHT HAVE DONE IN THAT HOUR - UNLESS THE GAMEMASTER DECIDES OTHERWISE, ACTIVITY PERFORMED HAS NO BEARING UPON THEM. IT SEEMS THAT, IN THIS CASE, EXPERIENCE POINTS ARE NOT REALLY NEEDED; WHAT YOU HAVE IS A SORT OF ODD CROSS BETWEEN A STORYTELLING SYSTEM AND A DICE-BASED ONE. THE MAGIC SYSTEM HAS SOME DIFFERENCES, BUT IT IS EASY ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND, AND QUITE A FEW OF THE SPELLS HAVE FAMILIAR-SOUNDING NAMES - FAMILIAR TO THOSE WHO HAVE USED MAGIC IN OTHER SYSTEMS. THERE ARE NO TRUE CHARACTER CLASSES; THERE ARE, HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF ARCHETYPES LISTED WHICH SHOW THE SKILLS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO DEVELOP A CHARACTER ALONG THE ARCHETYPE'S LINES, BUT THERE IS NO REASON WHY THESE SHOULD BE FOLLOWED; CHARACTERS CAN BE DEVELOPED ANY WAY THE PLAYERS WISH, INSIDE CERTAIN RULES. THE WORLD AS A WHOLE HAS VARIOUS COUNTRIES THAT CERTAINLY HAVE A FAMILIAR FEEL TO THEM; AS IT SAYS IN THE INTRODUCTION, THIS ISN'T EARTH, BUT THERE WILL BE FAMILIAR BITS. THIS INCLUDES GODS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM VARIOUS OLDER RELIGIONS AND SOME OF THE DESCRIBED COUNTRIES HAVE A FAMILIAR BASE. THE COMMONWEALTH OF NEW ARCADIA, AND SOME OF THE NEARBY AREAS AND COUNTRIES IN THE UNCHARTED TERRITORIES, ARE THE MOST DETAILED, AND HAVE A MAP - ALTHOUGH THE MAP COULD BE IMPROVED UPON, PERHAPS BY MAKING IT BIGGER AND AVAILABLE AS A SEPARATE FILE. THIS IS THE REGION WHERE ADVENTURES ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE. THE COMMONWEALTH HAS ELEMENTS OF VICTORIAN ENGLAND AND THE AMERICAN OLD WEST, AND SOME COLONIAL INFLUENCES, BY THE LOOKS OF IT INCLUDING AUSTRALIA. THIS COUNTRY ALSO HAS ELEMENTS OF A MODERN POLICE STATE. AS WELL AS THE COMMONWEALTH, THERE ARE ANCIENT EMPIRES, UNDEAD AND ELEMENTS OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC; THIS IS NOT JUST A PURE TECHNOLOGY SETTING. TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE SETTING, THERE ARE ALSO SOME SUPPLEMENTS AVAILABLE. STEAMCRAFT: SHADOWS OVER NEWPORT IS A COMBINATION OF CITYBOOK AND SETTING, WITH SOME NEW RULES AND ITEMS, AND THERE IS ALSO THE THREE PART ADVENTURE, STEAMCRAFT - WAKE THE DEAD. THE SETTING IS INTERESTING, BUT SOME OF THE ACTUAL GAME SYSTEM ELEMENTS SEEM A BIT LACKING, SUCH AS THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED EXPERIENCE POINTS, AND SOME OF THE TYPES OF MAGIC LOOK TO BE BETTER TO CHOOSE THAN OTHERS FOR PLAYERS. IT ISN'T MADE CLEAR AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ACTUALLY PLAYTESTED, BUT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO RUN AN ADVENTURE OR CAMPAIGN TO MAKE A DEFINITE DECISION ON THE SYSTEM ITSELF. HAVING SAID THAT, THIS IS A COMPLETE SYSTEM IN ONE BOOK, AND THERE ARE ITEMS, SKILLS, MAGIC AND CREATURES INCLUDED, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER IN PARTICULAR WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING EXPANDED WITH MORE CREATURES AND MORE SPELLS AND ITEMS WOULDN'T GO AMISS EITHER. BEING A PERCENTILE-BASED SYSTEM, IT MIGHT BE COMPARATIVELY EASY TO ADAPT THE SETTING TO ANOTHER GAME SYSTEM; DOING SO, HOWEVER, WOULD MAKE AROUND TWO-THIRDS OF THIS BOOK - THE PART TAKEN UP PRIMARILY BY THE GAME SYSTEM - RATHER UNNECESSARY. STEAMCRAFT IS AN INTERESTING STEAMPUNK GAME SETTING, BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO JUDGE ITS VALUE AS A GAME SYSTEM. STEAMCRAFT EGDCLTD 2015-07-28 3.5 0 5 3.5/5 ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

71	A GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY MEET ON TUESDAY, WHICH DISCUSSED THE SLOWDOWN IN CHINA AND PROPOSALS TO CONVERT THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRYS ECONOMIC WOES INTO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIA, WILL BE QUICKLY FOLLOWED UP WITH A HIGH-LEVEL COMMERCIAL DIALOGUE WITH CHINA NEXT WEEK. DURING THE SIX-DAY MEETING STARTING SEPTEMBER 14, THE OFFICIAL INDIAN SIDE LED BY COMMERCE SECRETARY RITA TEAOTIA IS EXPECTED TO TAKE UP CONCERNS OF THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY INCLUDING FEARS OF DUMPING FROM CHINESE COMPANIES FOLLOWING THE RECENT YUAN DEVALUATION, BESIDES THE TROUBLES FACED BY INDIAN COMPANIES IN GETTING GREATER MARKET ACCESS IN SECTORS SUCH AS IT/ITES, PHARMACEUTICALS AND FARM PRODUCTS. INDIA WANTS CHINA TO ENSURE GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND SIMPLIFICATION REGARDING PROCEDURES CONCERNING INSPECTION, REGISTRATION AND CLEARANCES OF INDIAN IMPORTS. CITING INDIAS BURGEONING TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA, NEW DELHI IS ALSO LIKELY TO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE CHINA TO OFFSET THIS TRADE IMBALANCE BY INVESTING IN THE NARENDRA MODI GOVERNMENTS MAKE IN INDIA INITIATIVE. INDIA IS LOOKING TO PUSH CHINA TO KEEP ITS WORD ON THE PROMISE IT MADE LAST SEPTEMBER (DURING CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPINGS INDIA VISIT) TO INVEST $20 BILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, INCLUDING IN INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN INDIA. A BUSINESS DELEGATION IS ALSO LIKELY TO JOIN THE OFFICIAL DELEGATION TO EXPLORE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA AND TO FORGE JOINT VENTURES IN FIELDS SUCH AS PROJECT EXPORTS. INDIAS TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA HAD HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH OF $48.5 BILLION IN FY15 (OR FOUR TIMES INDIAS EXPORTS TO CHINA IN THE FISCAL) FROM JUST $1.1 BILLION IN FY04. IN APRIL-JUNE FY16, THE TRADE DEFICIT HAS ALREADY TOUCHED $12.3 BILLION. ON THE OTHER HAND, TOTAL FDI INFLOWS FROM CHINA TO INDIA DURING APRIL 2000-JUNE 2015 WERE JUST $1.1 BILLION (OR A MINUSCULE 0.4% OF THE TOTAL $258 BILLION WORTH TOTAL FDI INFLOWS INTO INDIA DURING THE 15-YEAR PERIOD), FAR BELOW POTENTIAL. OTHER ISSUES THAT COULD COME UP FOR DISCUSSION INCLUDE COMPLAINTS FROM INDIAN EXPORTERS AGAINST SPURIOUS DRUGS MADE IN CHINA, BRANDED WRONGLY AS INDIAN AND SOLD IN OVERSEAS MARKETS TO DAMAGE THE REPUTATION OF INDIAN DRUG COMPANIES. CHINA HAD ASSURED TO INVEST AND DEVELOP TWO MEGA INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN GUJARAT AND MAHARASHTRA, BESIDES INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN INDIA. HOWEVER, DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING THE REQUIRED LAND FOR THESE INDUSTRIAL PARKS HAS BEEN THE CAUSE FOR DELAY, SOURCES SAID. THE INDUSTRIAL PARKS WERE MEANT TO MANUFACTURE ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, POWER EQUIPMENT, INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY, APPAREL, ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS AND FOOTWEAR, BESIDES OTHER VALUE-ADDED ITEMS. THEY WERE THEN TO BE EXPORTED TO CHINA AND OTHER MARKETS TO BOOST INDIAS EXPORTS AND AT THE SAME TIME REDUCE THE TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA. ALSO, DESPITE PROMISES AT THE HIGHEST POLITICAL LEVELS ON REMOVING BARRIERS TO ENABLE INDIAN COMPANIES ESPECIALLY IN SECTORS THAT MATTERS MOST TO INDIA (INCLUDING PHARMA, IT/ITES, FARM PRODUCTS, MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT, AND AUTO COMPONENTS) GET BETTER MARKET ACCESS, THERE WAS NOT MUCH RESPONSE FROM THE GROUND-LEVEL AUTHORITIES IN CHINA TO REMOVE THESE OBSTACLES, SOURCES SAID. EXPORTERS HAD SAID THE YUAN DEVALUATION WILL NOT ONLY AFFECT INDIAS IMPORTS FROM CHINA (AS THEIR REALISATION WILL BE LESSER) BUT ALSO MAKE CHINESE PRODUCTS MORE COMPETITIVE THAN COMPETING INDIAN ITEMS SUCH AS MANMADE FIBRES, GARMENTS, GEMS AND JEWELLERY, STEEL AND ORGANIC CHEMICALS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET, FURTHER HITTING INDIAS OVERALL EXPORTS.

75	TWITTER MAKES DONATING TO YOUR FAVORITE POLITICIAN JUST A TWEET AWAY THE SOCIAL NETWORK TEAMS UP WITH MOBILE-PAYMENTS COMPANY SQUARE TO ENABLE US USERS TO GIVE MONEY TO CAMPAIGNS VIA A TWEET. BY TERRY COLLINS @TERRYSCOLLINS SEPTEMBER 15, 2015 12:16 PM PDT UPDATED: SEPTEMBER 15, 2015 12:16 PM PDT TWITTER AND SQUARE HAVE CREATED A FEATURE TO MAKE DONATIONS DIRECTLY TO CANDIDATES THROUGH A TWEET. TWITTER TWITTER USERS CAN NOW DONATE CASH TO THEIR FAVORITE POLITICIANS IN THE US THROUGH A TWEET. THE SOCIAL NETWORK ANNOUNCED TUESDAY IT IS PARTNERING WITH MOBILE-PAYMENTS COMPANY SQUARE ON A FEATURE THAT LETS TWITTER'S USERS IN THE US CONTRIBUTE TO POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS VIA A TWEET. TWITTER SAID THE NEW FUNDRAISING FEATURE IS ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS FOR USERS TO MAKE A DONATION ON A PLATFORM WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY FIERCELY DEBATING AND FOLLOWING THE 2016 ELECTION RACE. "WHEN PEOPLE HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT POLITICS, THEY HAVE THEM ON TWITTER," SAID THE COMPANY IN A STATEMENT. "IT'S WHAT VOTERS LEARN AND SHARE IN THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT ROUTINELY MOTIVATES POLITICAL ACTION. THAT'S WHY WE'RE MAKING IT EASIER FOR TWITTER USERS TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT CANDIDATES AND CAUSES." POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET MORE MOBILE DONATIONS FROM POTENTIAL VOTERS ON THE GO. IN THE PAST, IF CANDIDATES WANTED TO RAISE MONEY ON TWITTER, THEY WOULD PROVIDE A LINK TO THEIR WEBSITE, WHICH MEANT USERS WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THE SOCIAL NETWORK'S SITE TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN TWITTER AND SQUARE SHOULDN'T COME AS A SURPRISE. BOTH SAN FRANCISCO-BASED COMPANIES WERE CO-FOUNDED BY JACK DORSEY, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF SQUARE AND THE CURRENT INTERIM CEO OF TWITTER. THE NEW FEATURE COMES AS MANY INVESTORS WONDER WHETHER DORSEY COULD RUN BOTH COMPANIES IF HE IS NAMED PERMANENT CEO OF TWITTER. LAST WEEK, MAJOR TWITTER INVESTOR CHRIS SACCA TWEETED THAT DORSEY CAN HANDLE IT. RELATED LINKS MAJOR TWITTER INVESTOR SAYS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. HIRE A NEW CEO! WALL STREET PONDERS WHETHER TO FLY THE COOP ON TWITTER TWITTER WANTS A CEO WHO CAN MAKE A 'FULL-TIME COMMITMENT' "THE MARKET KNOWS THAT [DORSEY] HAS SUCH STRONG TEAMS AT BOTH [SQUARE] AND [TWITTER] THAT HE CAN RUN BOTH COMPANIES," HE SAID. "THIS IS SETTLED." WITH THE NEW FUNDRAISING FEATURE, CAMPAIGNS CAN SET UP AN ACCOUNT THROUGH SQUARE CASH TO ASK FOR AND ACCEPT DONATIONS THROUGH A UNIQUE LINK CALLED "$CASHTAG." WHEN USERS SEE A TWEET WITH A $CASHTAG, THEY CAN CLICK A "CONTRIBUTE" BUTTON TO MAKE A DONATION AFTER SUBMITTING THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION, REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION, AND PAYMENT PLAN. OF COURSE, USERS THEN HAVE THE OPTION TO TWEET OUT THEIR SUPPORT. AT LEAST A DOZEN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, INCLUDING DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS BERNIE SANDERS AND HILLARY CLINTON, HAVE STARTED USING THE NEW FEATURE, SAID NICK PACILIO, A TWITTER SPOKESMAN. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SCOTT WALKER AND MIKE HUCKABEE HAVE ALSO SIGNED ON. WALKER TOOK TO TWITTER ON TUESDAY ASKING FOR FUNDS PRIOR TO THE SECOND GOP PRIMARY DEBATE IN SIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA, ON WEDNESDAY. "SHOW SCOTT WALKER SOME SUPPORT GOING INTO THE SECOND DEBATE BY DONATING $2," THE TWEET READ. A TWITTER SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T GET A CUT OF THE DONATIONS, BUT SQUARE'S STANDARD DEDUCTION OF 1.9 PERCENT FOR EACH TRANSACTION APPLIES.

76	ATTRACTIVE YIELD AND HIGHER SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PRICE OUT PRIVATE SECTOR BORROWERS DUBAI: THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF) SAID THAT THE SAUDI ARABIAS PLAN TO MEET LARGE FISCAL DEFICITS THROUGH DEBT FINANCING WILL HELP SLOW THE EROSION OF GOVERNMENT DEPOSITS IN THE BANKING SYSTEM, AND BUILD A YIELD CURVE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS.  ATTRACTIVE YIELD HIGHER SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PRICE OUT PRIVATE SECTOR BORROWERS AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT RESULTING IN HIGHER BORROWING COSTS FOR PRIVATE BORROWERS. WE EXPECT CORPORATE BANK LOAN PRICING IN SAUDI ARABIA TO INCREASE AS THE SOVEREIGN ISSUANCE ABSORBS THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE BANKING SYSTEM, SAID TREVOR CULLINAN,  AN ANALYST AT STANDARD & POORS. ALTHOUGH PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING HAD GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST DECADE, THE YIELD COMPRESSION IN THE POST FINANCIAL CRISIS YEARS HAS RESULTED IN DECLINING APPETITE FOR PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING.  ACNE IS A PREVALENT CONDITION, SO TAKE A FEW OF THE IDEAS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY INTRODUCED AND COMMENCE APPLYING THEM TODAY. SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2009, GLOBAL AND LOCAL INTEREST RATES HAVE DECLINED SHARPLY TO HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS. NET INTEREST MARGINS (NIMS) FOR SAUDI BANKS HAVE VISIBLY SHRUNK IN THE PAST FEW YEARS IN LINE WITH DECLINING LENDING PRICES AND LOW INTEREST RATES, TO 2.9 PER CENT LAST YEAR FROM 3.9 PER CENT IN 2009. OWING TO INCREASED COMPETITION, CORPORATE PRICING HAS SOFTENED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST FEW YEARS RESULTING IN VISIBLE MARGIN EROSION FOR THE BANKS. AS A RESULT, THE NIM OF RATED SAUDI BANKS CONTRACTED 100 BASIS POINTS ON AGGREGATE BETWEEN 2008 AND 2014. WE NOW EXPECT A REVERSAL IN THIS TREND BECAUSE THE BANKS WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE RETURNS ON ZERO-RISK-WEIGHTED GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, SAID TIMUCIN ENGIN, AN ANALYST WITH S&P. THE RATING AGENCY EXPECTS DEPOSIT GROWTH TO VISIBLY SLOWDOWN IN THE COMING QUARTERS DUE TO LOW OIL PRICES AND WE EXPECT BANKS SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY BUFFERS TO GRADUALLY TIGHTEN. SAUDI BANKS ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE THEIR BALANCE SHEET ALLOCATION TO OTHER EXPOSURES TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE SOVEREIGN ISSUANCE. S & P EXPECTS THE BANKS TO VISIBLY REDUCE THEIR LIQUID ASSET EXPOSURES OVER THE NEXT FEW QUARTERS. THE AVERAGE YIELD ON THE RECENT 10-YEAR SAUDI ISSUANCE IS 265 BPS OR 49 BPS OVER US TREASURIES, WHILE SAUDI BANKS GENERATE LESS THAN 15 BPS BLENDED YIELD ON THEIR INTERBANK PLACEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES. THIS MEANS THE BANKS SHOULD A VISIBLE INCREASE IN ASSET DURATION. WE EXPECT SEE THE BANKS APPETITE FOR PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING GRADUALLY DECLINE. SINCE 2003, PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING HAS GROWN FROM A BASE OF 42 PER CENT OF SYSTEM ASSETS TO 60 PER CENT, AS BANKS PLACED FROM MATURING GOVERNMENT SECURITIES INTO OTHER YIELD-GENERATING ASSETS. THIS SHIFT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE ACCELERATION IN THE GOVERNMENTS CAPITAL SPENDING, WHICH FUELLED GROWTH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR ACROSS VARIOUS ECONOMIC SEGMENTS, SAID ENGIN.
77	CURRENT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS WAVES AFTER SPEAKING AT A REPUBLICAN VICTORY PARTY IN AUSTIN, TEXAS. IN TEA PARTY FRIENDLY TEXAS, NO POLITICAL STAR HAS BURNED BRIGHTER IN RECENT YEARS THAN TED CRUZ. HE RODE A GRASSROOTS GROUNDSWELL TO AN UPSET SENATE VICTORY IN 2012, FURTHER SOLIDIFIED HIS CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALS BY HELPING LEAD A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND HAS BUILT HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AROUND WOOING THE REPUBLICAN PARTYS FAR RIGHT WING. BUT CRUZ MAY SOON BE FINDING HIMSELF DEFENDING HIS HOME TURF. SEPTEMBER 01, 2015 HE RODE A GRASSROOTS GROUNDSWELL TO AN UPSET SENATE VICTORY IN 2012, FURTHER SOLIDIFIED HIS CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALS BY HELPING LEAD A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND HAS BUILT HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AROUND WOOING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S FAR RIGHT WING. BUT CRUZ MAY SOON BE FINDING HIMSELF DEFENDING HIS HOME TURF. THE FIRST-TERM SENATOR ADDRESSED A HOMETOWN CROWD IN HOUSTON ON TUESDAY AND WILL HOLD THREE CAMPAIGN EVENTS STATEWIDE THURSDAY ALTOGETHER HIS FIRST PUBLIC TEXAS VISITS SINCE A PRE-JULY 4 TOUR FOR HIS NEW BOOK. HE'S COMING BACK JUST AS DONALD TRUMP HAS SHOT TO THE TOP OF STATEWIDE POLLS, MIRRORING A NATIONAL RISE. OTHER RIVALS, JEB BUSH AND SCOTT WALKER AMONG THEM, HAVE COME TO TEXAS MORE FREQUENTLY OR AT LEAST MORE RECENTLY. THEY ARE MOUNTING A CHALLENGE TO CRUZ THAT HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO COME FROM HOME-STATE RIVAL RICK PERRY, THE FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR WHO INSTEAD IS BARELY MAKING AN IMPACT IN THE STATE. FOR CRUZ, SAID AUSTIN-BASED REPUBLICAN CONSULTANT MATT MACKOWIAK, "TEXAS IS NOT A GUARANTEE." CRUZ WILL HOLD A RALLY IN FORT WORTH ON THURSDAY AND TEA PARTY EVENTS IN TYLER AND BACK IN HOUSTON. HIS WIFE, HEIDI, ADDRESSED A SAN ANTONIO CROWD RECENTLY. CRUZ RELISHES BEING A POLITICAL INSURGENT. BUT SINCE TRUMP HAS CRANKED UP THE CAMPAIGN'S OUTLANDISHNESS, PRIMARY VOTERS WHO MIGHT HAVE LOOKED TO CRUZ TO SHAKE UP THE STATUS QUO COULD GRAVITATE TO HIS REALITY-TV STAR COMPETITOR. "NOBODY WILL OUTWORK TED ON THE GROUND," SAID JOANN FLEMING, CRUZ'S TEXAS TEA PARTY CHAIRWOMAN AND ORGANIZER OF THE TYLER EVENT. BUT FLEMING ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED TRUMP'S APPEAL. "THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT CREATED A DONALD TRUMP-SIZE VACUUM," SHE SAID, "BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAILED TO DO ANYTHING THEY PROMISED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEY WOULD DO." CRUZ HAS BEEN CONSPICUOUSLY CAREFUL NOT TO CRITICIZE TRUMP. INDEED, HE PLANS TO APPEAR WITH HIM AT A CAPITOL HILL RALLY AGAINST THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN. BUT TRUMP'S ASCENSION IN TEXAS HASN'T GONE UNNOTICED. "IT'D BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR (CRUZ) TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE OF OTHER STATES HOW HE SHOULD BE THE NOMINEE IF HIS HOMETOWN REPUBLICANS DON'T GIVE HIM A FIRST-PLACE FINISH," SAID FORMER TEXAS REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIRMAN STEVE MUNISTERI, WHO LEFT HIS POST TO WORK FOR RAND PAUL'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. CRUZ SPOKESWOMAN CATHERINE FRAZIER SHRUGGED OFF SUGGESTIONS CRUZ HAS TO SHORE UP HIS TEXAS FLANK. SHE SAID THE HOME-STATE SWING WAS PLANNED BEFORE TRUMP'S SURGE IN POLLING: "WE'RE FOCUSED ON OUR OWN CAMPAIGN." CRUZ SAYS HE'S BUILDING A CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE AND GRASSROOTS SUPPORT IN AREAS WITH PRIMARIES BEYOND THE STATES THAT OPEN PRESIDENTIAL VOTING: IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA. THAT'S WHY HE TOURED THE SOUTH BY BUS AND VISITED STATES SUCH AS WYOMING. TEXAS MOVED UP ITS PRIMARY TO MARCH 1, MEANING IT WILL VOTE RIGHT AFTER THE OPENING THREE STATES AND NEVADA. IT'S NOW ONE OF 12 STATES IN THE "SEC PRIMARY," SO DUBBED BECAUSE MANY HAVE COLLEGE TEAMS IN THE NCAA'S SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE. BUT WITH 150-PLUS DELEGATES AT STAKE, TEXAS IS THE BIGGEST PRIZE, THOUGH IT WON'T BE WINNER-TAKE-ALL. CRUZ "WILL RARELY BE IN TEXAS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE," FLEMING WARNED SUPPORTERS IN AN INVITATION TO THE TYLER EVENT. "HE HAS 49 OTHER STATES TO VISIT." BEFORE THE RACE BEGAN, TEXAS LOOKED TO BE A CRUZ-PERRY SHOWDOWN. BUT PERRY HAS STRUGGLED SINCE LEAVING OFFICE IN JANUARY AS THE LONGEST-SERVING GOVERNOR IN STATE HISTORY. MOST FOCUSED ON IOWA, PERRY HASN'T HELD TEXAS CAMPAIGN EVENTS SINCE ENTERING THE RACE IN JUNE. CRUZ'S CAMPAIGN RAISED ABOUT $6 MILLION IN TEXAS THROUGH JUNE, COMPARED WITH LESS THAN $700,000 FOR PERRY, ACCORDING TO FEDERAL ELECTIONS COMMISSION DATA. BUSH, WHO WAS BORN IN THE WEST TEXAS OIL PATCH AND WHOSE SON GEORGE P. IS THE STATE'S LAND COMMISSIONER, GOT MORE THAN $1 MILLION FROM TEXAS DONORS. BUSH, THE FLORIDA GOVERNOR, ALSO CAMPAIGNED ON THE TEXAS-MEXICO BORDER LAST WEEK AND USED HIS FLUENT SPANISH, WHICH CRUZ DOESN'T SPEAK, THOUGH HIS FATHER'S FROM CUBA. WALKER, THE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR, IS COMING THIS WEEK FOR FUNDRAISING AND POLITICAL EVENTS IN DALLAS, SAN ANTONIO AND MIDLAND IN WEST TEXAS. HE'S "NOT CEDING ANYTHING TO ANYONE IN TEXAS," SAID SPOKESWOMAN KIRSTEN KUKOWSKI. HE ALSO VISITED THE MEXICO BORDER, IN MARCH, WITH TEXAS GOV. GREG ABBOTT, WHO DIDN'T PARTICIPATE WHEN CRUZ, TRUMP OR BUSH TOURED THE BORDER. PAUL, A KENTUCKY SENATOR, CAMPAIGNED IN TEXAS IN JULY AND GOT HELP FROM RELATIVES HIS FATHER WAS A LONGTIME TEXAS CONGRESSMAN. MACKOWIAK, THE GOP OPERATIVE, SAID THE CHALLENGE FOR CRUZ'S CAMPAIGN IS TO WIN THE MOST TEXAS DELEGATES POSSIBLE WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE TIME OR MONEY THAN NECESSARY. "THEY NEED THAT MONEY AND THAT TIME TO SPEND ON THE OTHER STATES," MACKOWIAK SAID, "WHERE HE'S LESS WELL-KNOWN." SUBJECTS PEOPLE LOCATIONS ORGANISATIONS
78	IT STARTED LAST YEAR! THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND THEN THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARRIVING ON THE SHORES OF ITALY AND GREECE. THEY HAD HORRIBLE STORIES OF DEVASTATION, OF INDISCRIMINATE KILLINGS IN THEIR HOMELANDS, OF RAPES, AND OF THE COMPLETE DESOLATION OF THEIR HOMES, VILLAGES, AND TOWNS. MOREOVER THEY WERE HAPPY THAT THEY ARRIVED ON SOME EUROPEAN OR MEDITERRANEAN SHORE BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THEM, OTHERS NEVER MADE IT. THEY PERISHED IN TRANSIT. EUROPE OPENED ITS DOORS AND ITS SOCIAL SERVICES AND MANY OF THEM SETTLED IN THE COUNTRIES THAT WERE DOING BETTER ECONOMICALLY - IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY IN GREECE WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS GOING THROUGH ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND SO THE DESTINATION BECAME EITHER GERMANY OR SWEDEN. IN SOTTO VOCE, OR A WHISPER, WE HEARD ABOUT INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS FROM IRAQ, SYRIA, AND AFGHANISTAN THAT WERE MAKING MONEY IN THE TRANSPORTATION OF THESE GROUPS OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA OR TRANSPORTING THEM ACROSS EUROPE. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, TRANSPORTATION LIKE THIS IS EASY BECAUSE THERE IS ALMOST AN ABSENCE OF BORDERS. TRAVEL AND EMPLOYMENT WERE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE. THEN THIS SUMMER, THE NUMBERS CHANGED. THE HUNDREDS BECAME THOUSANDS AND THE THOUSANDS BECAME TENS OF THOUSANDS. THE FRONTIERS SUDDENLY WERE FLOODED. OVER TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY WOULD CROSS A BORDER AND CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY ON FOOT, BY TRAIN, OR BY BUS. THE MULTITUDES TRAVELING ON FOOT WOULD SEEK THE SHORTEST DISTANCE TO GERMANY. THE PATHWAY WAS THROUGH GREECE, SERBIA, HUNGARY, AUSTRIA AND GERMANY. EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHICH ARE NOT A PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION STARTED TO WATCH THEIR BORDERS. THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT BECAME A PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS ARE THEMSELVES STRUGGLING WITH POVERTY, HOMELESSNESS, AND UNEMPLOYMENT. THEY HAVE NOT WELCOMED THE NEW IMMIGRANTS. THEN HUNGARY, THE MAIN TRANSITIONING COUNTRY, CREATED A BARBED WIRE FENCE. WHEN THIS WAS BROKEN, THE MILITARY WERE CALLED TO RESPOND AND PROTECT THE BORDER. AS A RESPONSE TO WHAT WAS CALLED HUNGARIAN BARBARITY, OTHER COUNTRIES ATTACKED HUNGARY IN THEIR MAJOR NEWSPAPERS. THE IMMIGRANTS WERE WELCOMED TO CROATIA, WHICH FOR TWO DAYS WELCOMED EVERYONE WHO COULD COME AND REGISTER THERE ON THE WAY TO GERMANY. UP NORTH, GERMANY HERSELF BECAME EXHAUSTED AND CLOSED ITS OWN BORDERS. THE WHOLE ISSUE IS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND THERE ARE MANY OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT THE REFUGEES HOPE TO FIND AND HOW THE REST OF THE WORLD SHOULD RECEIVE THEM. THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE ASKED WHY THE MUSLIM COUNTRIES ARE NOT RECEIVING THESE IMMIGRANTS - AFTER ALL, THEY ARE THEIR OWN BROTHERS. THEN THERE WAS A DECISION FOR EACH EUROPEAN COUNTRY TO TAKE A NUMBER OF REFUGEES BASED ON THEIR POPULATION, BUT THAT DECISION WAS NOT RECEIVED WELL. OTHERS ARE SAYING THAT THE LAWS THAT WERE CREATED FOR IMMIGRANTS AT THE END OF WORLD WAR II WERE PRIMARILY FOR POLITICAL REFUGEES, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME WITHIN THE LAST YEAR CAME PRIMARILY BECAUSE EUROPE IS PROVIDING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SERVICES THAT THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET IN THEIR COUNTRIES. THEN THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT THE ARRIVAL OF MILLIONS OF MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS WILL SPEED THE ISLAMIZATION OF EUROPE AND SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ONLY ACCEPT SYRIAN CHRISTIANS. COUNTRIES SUCH AS SERBIA, MACEDONIA, AND MONTENEGRO ARE AFRAID TO ALLOW IMMIGRANTS IN SINCE KOSOVO BECAME A NEW COUNTRY AND THEY ARE AFRAID OF AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN ALBANIA AND KOSOVO WHICH COULD SWALLOW UP TERRITORIES THAT ARE BEING POPULATED BY MOSLEMS. OTHERS IN GERMANY ARE SAYING THAT THE NEW ARRIVALS DO NOT INTEGRATE. INSTEAD THEY DICTATE THINGS TO THE PEOPLE ALREADY LIVING THERE, AS IN THE CASE OF THE IMAMS ASKING GERMAN SCHOOLS TO RECONSIDER THE DRESS CODE OF THE GERMAN GIRLS SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT TEMPT THE MUSLIM BOYS. THERE ARE POLITICIANS AND ECONOMISTS WHO ARE TELLING US THAT THE SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND THE COMPASSION EXHIBITED BY EUROPE WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEY TELL US THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT IN EUROPE BEING ABLE TO HANDLE THE SITUATION, BUT WITH THE SYSTEMS AND THE GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THE WELFARE OF THEIR PEOPLE. THEY TELL US THAT AS LONG AS POVERTY AND THESE INDISCRIMINATE WARS CONTINUE, ONE PART OF THE WORLD WILL HAVE THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF IMMIGRANTS. THIS MORNING, I RECEIVED AN EMAIL ABOUT A CHURCH LEADER IN SOUTHERN EUROPE. THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE COMING TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP THIS SITUATION. MANY REMEMBER THAT BIBLE PASSAGE IN WHICH THE APOSTLES ASKED THE LORD JESUS CHRIST TO SEND THE MULTITUDES AWAY, BUT HE HAD COMPASSION ON THEM AND ASKED THEM TO SIT DOWN AND CREATED THAT MIRACLE OF MULTIPLYING THE BREAD FOR 5,000 PEOPLE. WHAT IS THE COMPASSIONATE ACTION NEEDED IN OUR DAY? THE HUMANITY AND DIGNITY OF EUROPE IS BEING TESTED IN HOW THEY REACT TO THIS MULTITUDE WHO HAS GREATLY SUFFERED AND WHO IN ANOTHER WAY WANT TO BENEFIT FROM THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE WESTERN WORLD. THE COMPASSION OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD IS BEING TESTED AS TO OUR WILLINGNESS TO GIVE NOT ONLY FROM OUR ABUNDANCE, BUT TO GIVE EVEN ABOVE IT, BECAUSE THESE ARE GOD'S CHILDREN.
79	DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, LATELY IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS (LETS CALL THEM RAOUL AND CHRISTINE, FOR CONVENIENCES SAKE) THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND RECENTLY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP. IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT CLOSE TO TEN YEARS AND I CONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP. RAOUL, IVE KNOWN FOR ALMOST AS LONG, BUT WE LIVE IN THE SAME CITY AND HANG OUT OCCASIONALLY. THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES. CHRISTINE AND I HAD A FALLING OUT SOME TIME AGO AND ONLY RECENTLY RECONNECTED. DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST. ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN THOUGH RAOUL IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, I HAVE GOTTEN TO SEE A LOT OF HIS BAD SIDE (PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, SINCE I DONT TRUST MYSELF TO NOT BE BIASED), INCLUDING HIS (SEEMING) UNWILLINGNESS TO BE AFFECTIONATE EVEN IN A RELATIONSHIP HE INITIATES. IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL IN ONE OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER, THIS WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND RAOUL HAS SINCE CHANGED. ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?). I KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME; I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THAT. BUT I JUST CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. PART OF ME WONDERS IF IM BEING TOO CLINGY ABOUT THIS? ITS THEIR LIVES AND I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO GET IT IN PRACTICE. ANOTHER PART WONDERS IF IM BEING UNFAIR TO RAOUL? MAYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR THEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE. IVE THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW IM NOT AS BOTHERED AS I WAS INITIALLY. UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH. I STILL CANT FULLY COME TO TERMS WITH IT AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS BETTER THAN THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY I CANT JUST LIVE AND LET LIVE? WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO? SIGNED, OVERLY ANXIOUS FOR NO GOOD REASON
80	FINALLY, THE CONFESSION WE HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. DIFFICULT THOUGH IT IS TO IGNORE THE STRETCHING OF CREDIBILITY IN THESE EPISODES, ILL DO MY BEST. ROBERT URGES TRACY TO TELL THE TRUTH - TO CONFESS TO CARLA THAT IT WAS HER WHO STARTED THE FIRE. ITS NOT EASY WATCHING HER TORTURE HERSELF OVER SOMETHING YOU DID. THIS OF COURSE BEGS THE QUESTION, WHY IS HE SO BOTHERED? IS IT BECAUSE HE IS JUST ON THE SIDE OF JUSTICE OR IS IT BECAUSE HE THINKS TRACY WILL FEEL BETTER FOR CONFESSING? HE TELLS TRACY THAT SHE SHOULD CONFESS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, OR ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE TO. ROY SPOTS CARLA DRINKING AND LOOKING AT MADDIES MEMORIAL. ROY ASKS, DO YOU THINK DRINKING IS A GOOD IDEA? HER REPLY ALWAYS. CARLA IS DRINKING, AGAIN, THIS TIME IN HER CAR, AND TRACY GETS IN AND SITS BESIDE HER. ALL THIS MOPING ABOUT, THIS WEIRD CRAWLING AROUND LIKE SOME MESSENGER OF DOOM. ITS BORDERLINE SELF INDULGENT, ITS NOT A GOOD LOOK. TRACY PLEADS WITH CARLA, TELLING HER TO STOP BLAMING HERSELF FOR THE DEATHS OF KAL AND MADDIE. SHE TELLS HER THE FIRE WAS AN ACCIDENT. WITH NO WARNING, CARLA HEADS OFF IN HER CAR WITH TRACY AS HER PASSENGER. BUCKLE UP BARLOW, WERE IN FOR A GOOD RIDE. GOODNESS ONLY KNOWS WHAT THE ALCOHOL LEVEL IN CARLS BLOOD MUST BE BY NOW. IT SEEMS SHE HAS BEEN DRINKING NON-STOP FOR WEEKS. TRACY IS CONCERNED THAT CARLAS DRIVING HEAVILY UNDER THE INFLUENCE, BUT CARLA YELLS AT HER, CHILL OUT TRACY, WERE NOT GOING TO CRASH. IVE KILLED ENOUGH PEOPLE FOR ONE LIFETIME. THE 2 WOMEN ARRIVE AT A QUARRY AND CLAMBER UP TO THE EDGE. THIS IS THE PLACE, SHE REVEALS WHERE SHE USED TO PLAY WITH HER BROTHER ROB AND THEIR MATES. SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS ARE CLEARLY AT THE FOREFRONT OF CARLAS MIND. TRACY TELLS HER IT WONT CHANGE ANYTHING IF SHE JUMPS. ITS JUST FATE, SHE SAYS. CARLA CARRIES THE FATE IDEA ON. FATE, YES, RED OR BLACK, HEADS OR TAILS, ITS JUST THE WAY THINGS FALL. HEADS I STAND, TAILS I FALL, SAYS CARLA. IT SEEMS AS IF CARLA IS JUST ABOUT TO GO OVER THE EDGE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE IS A SCREAM OF CARLA! WAIT! I DID IT! CARLA ASKS TRACY WHY SHE BOTHERED TO SAVE HER LIFE WHEN THE BUS CRASHED. SHE ADDS THAT IF TRACY HADNT SAVED HER, KAL AND MADDIE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE. TRACY REVEALS ALL. UNDERSTANDABLY CARLA IS VERY SHOCKED. THE 2 WOMEN ENGAGE IN A TUSSLE. EVENTUALLY THEY ARRIVE BACK ON THE COBBLES AND TRACY HAS TOLD EVERYTHING. HOW SHE STOLE MICHELLES KEYS TO GET INTO CARLAS FLAT AND HOW SHE WANTED CARLAS LIFE TO END, SEEING HER AS THE CAUSE OF ALL HER MISERY, INCLUDING ROBS GOING TO PRISON AND CARLA BUYING THE SHARE OF THE PUB THAT SHE, TRACY, HAD WANTED WITH TONY. TRACY CONFESSES THAT SHE WANTED TO MAKE CARLA PAY. IT SEEMED THAT CARLA HAD EVERYTHING AND THAT SHE, TRACY HAD NOTHING LEFT. AN EXTREMELY (UNDERSTANDABLY) UNFORGIVING CARLA TELLS TRACY, MY STAFF DESPISE ME, MY FRIENDS FEEL SORRY FOR ME, MY BUSINESS IS ON ITS KNEES. IVE THROWN IT ALL AWAY -ALL FOR TAKING THE RAP FOR YOU! ZEEDAN IS PLAYING A BLINDER! WHAT A RESPONSIBLE, THOUGHTFUL AND CONCERNED YOUNG MAN HE HAS BECOME. THE RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN LEANNE AND ZEEDAN IS THOROUGHLY PLAUSIBLE AND A JOY TO SEE. STILL GRIEVING FOR HIS DAD OF COURSE, HE DOES WHAT HIS DAD WOULD HAVE WANTED HIM TO DO AND THAT IS TO LOOK OUT FOR LEANNE. PRAISE TOO TO THE SHARIF FAMILY, AS A WHOLE, FOR WELCOMING LEANNE INTO THEIR FAMILY. LEANNE HAS ALREADY CONFESSED THAT SHE IS FRIGHTENED OF SIMON AND THAT HER STAY IN HOSPITAL IS DUE TO SIMONS VIOLENCE TOWARDS HER. LEANNE, STILL NOT FULLY RECOVERED, ASKS ZEEDAN TO HELP HER FIND SIMON. THIS PLAYS WELL. IT IS FULLY CREDIBLE THAT YOU CAN LOVE SOMEONE DEEPLY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING AFRAID OF THEM AND ALSO BEING ANXIOUS AS TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE AGGRESSOR. AN EXTREMELY UPSET AND WORRIED LEANNE IS ON THE POINT OF REPORTING SIMONS DISAPPEARANCE TO THE POLICE, ON KENS ADVICE WHEN, AMY TELLS THEM THAT HES UPSTAIRS IN HER BEDROOM. LEANNE RUSHES UPSTAIRS TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAS BEEN HIDING IN AMYS WARDROBE, BUT WHEN AMY WAS ASKED IF SHE HAD SEEN HIM OR KNEW WHERE HE WAS, SHE LIED. WE NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOUNG AMY SIMON IS DISTRAUGHT THAT LEANNE HAS TOLD ZEEDAN, WHO SIMON LOOKS UP TO, THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HES DONE. BUT ZEEDAN COVERS FOR LEANNE AND TELLS SIMON THAT HE GUESSED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT HE IS GUTTED. YOURE NOT THE LAD I THOUGHT YOU WERE. MAYBE THAT WILL OPEN SIMONS EYES AND HE WILL REALISE HOW LUCKY HE IS TO HAVE LEANNE AS HIS MUM. ZEEDAN TELLS SIMON THAT HE HAS LOST HIS MUM AND HIS DAD AND THAT SOME DAYS HE WANTS TO PUNCH BRICK WALLS, OTHERS, HE STRUGGLES TO GET OUT OF BED. HE SAYS HE WOULD NEVER LIFT A HAND TO HIS FAMILY. YOURE A GOOD KID SI, DEEP DOWN, I KNOW YOU ARE. ZEEDANS CONCERN FOR HIS FATHERS INTENDED, EVEN EXPANDS TO HIS TURNING UP WITH HIS SLEEPING BAG AND INSISTING HE IS STAYING THE NIGHT AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT SIMON IS NO LONGER A DANGER TO LEANNE. SIMON TELLS HIM, SHE DOESNT NEED A BODY GUARD. ZEEDAN REPLIES, AND YOURE GOING TO PROVE THAT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. ADMIRABLE. UNADMIRABLE IS THE WAY IN WHICH DAVID AND KYLIE ARE PLOTTING TO GET SHUT OF GAIL. THEY REASON THAT IF LILY COULD HAVE HER OWN ROOM THEN THEIR NIGHTS MIGHT BE BETTER. GAIL TELLS SALLY THAT THEY WANT HER OUT. ON SALLYS ADVICE GAIL DECIDES TO CONSULT TONY TO SEE IF IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO CONVERT THE GARAGE INTO A GRANNY FLAT FOR HER TO LIVE IN. SALLY, AU FAIT IN ALL MATTERS MODERN, OR AT LEAST SHE THINKS SHE IS, SAYS ITS NOT FRENCH DOORS, ITS BI-FOLDS AND ALSO THAT THEY ARE THE NEW BLACK. SHE ADDS THAT AN EN SUITE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. GAIL SPEAKS OF ASSISTED LIVING AS THE DEATH OF HOPE. ANNA AND TIM DO SEEM TO BE GETTING ON VERY WELL. THEY ARE BOTH DELIGHTED THAT THEYLL SEE MILEY SOON AND LOOK AT PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER. FAYE IS ASKED TO LOOK AT THE PHOTOGRAPHS BUT JUST SAYS CUTE. SHE IS SINGING THE LONELY GOAT HERD SONG, FROM THE SOUND OF MUSIC IN WHICH SHE WILL PLAY MARIA AND IN WHICH SHE IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED.

82	ATTRACTIVE YIELD AND HIGHER SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PRICE OUT PRIVATE SECTOR BORROWERS DUBAI: THE INTERNATIONAL MONETJARY FUND (IMF) SAID THAT THE SAUDI ARABIAS PLAN TO MEET LARGE FISCAL DEFICITS THROUGH DEBT FINANCING WILL HELP SLOW THE EROSION OF GOVERNMENT DEPOSITS IN THE BANKING SYSTEM, AND BUILD A YIELD CURVE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC  DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS.  ATTRACTIVE YIELD AND HIGHER SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PRICE OUT PRIVATE SECTOR BORROWERS AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT RESULTING IN HIGHER BORROWING COSTS FOR PRIVATE BORROWERS. WE EXPECT CORPORATE BANK LOAN PRICING IN SAUDI ARABIA TO INCREASE AS THE SOVEREIGN ISSUANCE ABSORBS THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE BANKING SYSTEM, SAID TREVOR CULLINAN, AN ANALYST AT STADNDARD & POORS. ALTHOUGGH PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING HAD GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST DECADE, THE YIELD COMPRESSION IN THE POST FINANCIAL CRISIS YEARS HAS RESULTED IN DECLINING APPETITE FOR PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING. SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2009, GLOBAL AND LOCAL INTEREST RATES HAVE DECLINED SHARPLY TO HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS. NET INTEREST MARGINS (NIMS) FOR SAUDI BANKS HAVE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS IN LINE WITH DECLINING LENDING PRICES AND LOW INTEREST RATES, TO 2.9 PER CENT LAST YEAR FROM 3.9 PER CENT IN 2009. OWING TO INCREASED COMPETITION, CORPORATE PRICING HAS SOFTENED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST FEW YEARS RESULTING IN VISIBLE MARGIN EROSION FOR THE BANKS. AS A RESULT, THE NIM OF RATED SAUDI BANKS CONTRACTED 100 BASIS POINTS ON AGGREGATE BETWEEN 2008 AND 2014.  WINNING THE AWARD, GARRETT SAID, WAS A GREAT WAY TO KICK OFF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY CELWEBRATPION. WE NOW EXPECT A REVERSAL IN THIS TREND BECAUSE THE BANKS WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE RETURNS ON ZERO-RISK-WEIGHTED GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, SAID TIMUCIN ENGIN, AN ANALYST WITH S&P. THE RATING AGENCY EXPECTS DEPOSIT GROWTH TO VISIBLY SLOWDOWN IN THE COMING QUARTERS DUE TO LOW OIL PRICES AND WE EXPECZT BANKS SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY BUFFERS TO GRADUALLY TIGHTEN.  THE ACTING MANAGING DIRECTOR, SAPETRO, MR. SAUDI BANKS ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE THEIR BALANCE SHEET ALLOCATION TO OTHER EXPOSURES TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE SOVEREIGN ISSUANCE. S  & P EXPECTS THE BANKS TO VISIBLY  REDUCE THEIR LIQUID ASSET EXPOSURES OVER THE NEXT FEW QUARTERS.  THEYLL THINK WE DID THEM A FAVOR. THE AVERAGE YIELD ON THE RECENT 10-YEAR SAUDI ISSUANCE IS 265 BPS OR 49 BPS OVER US TREASURIES, WHILE SAUDI BANKS GENERATE LESS THAN 15 BPS BLENDED YIELD ON THEIR INTERBANK PLACEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES. THIS MEANS THE BANKS SHOULD SEE A VISIBLE INCREASE IN ASSET DURATION.  SINCE 2003, PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING HAS GRWOWN FROM A BASE OF 42 PER CENT OF SYSTEM ASSETS TO 60 PER CENT, AS BANKS PLACED THE LIQUIDITY FROM MATURING GOVERNMENT SECURITIES INTO OTHER YIELD-GENERATING ASSETS. THIS SHIFT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE ACCELERATION IN THE GOVERNMENTS CAPITAL SPEYNDING, WHICH FUELLED GROWTH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR ACROSS VARIOUS ECONOMIC SEGMENTS, SAID ENGIN.
83	JAPAN DONT TIP ANYONE: TIPPING IS JUST NOT PART OF THE CULTURE. DONT EVEN LEAVE THE SMALL CHANGE. PEOPLE WILL COME RUNNING AFTER YOU WITH IT. DONT WEAR YOUR SHOES IN SOMEONES HOUSE: IF YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE TAKING THEIR SHOES OFF, DO THE SAME. (NOTE: THERES A SMALL AREA RIGHT INSIDE THE ENTRANCE CALLED A GENKAN WHICH IS USUALLY ONE LEVEL BELOW THE REST OF THE HOUSE, WHERE YOU TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES. YOU DONT TAKE THEM OFF OUTSIDE THE HOUSE!) DONT HUG PEOPLE YOU JUST MET: MOST PEOPLE DONT LIKE IT, ESPECIALLY OLDER FOLK. DONT STAND ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ESCALATOR: IN TOKYO YOU STAND ON THE LEFT. IN OSAKA YOU STAND ON THE RIGHT. FOLLOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING. GERMANY DONT DO THE NAZI SALUTE: NOT EVEN IN JEST. ITS A CRIME AND EVERY YEAR THERE ARE TOURISTS ARRESTED FOR IT. ALSO DONT CARRY ANY NAZI SYMBOLS ON YOU. DONT STARE: YOUD APPEAR EITHER UNEDUCATED OR MENTALLY ILL. DONT BE OVERLY FRIENDLY: GERMANS LIKE TO GRADUALLY WARM UP TO PEOPLE AND TAKE TIME TO REALLY GET TO KNOW THEM BEFORE ACTING LIKE BFFS. DONT WISH SOMEONE A HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEFORE THE ACTUAL DAY: THE ORIGIN IS A SUPERSTITION THAT SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO THEM (THEY MIGHT DIE) BEFORE THEIR BIRTHDAY IF YOU DO, HOWEVER THIS RULE IS NOT LIMITED TO SUPERSTITIOUS PEOPLE. EVEN BRIGHT, RATIONAL GERMANS WILL FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE ITS JUST NOT DONE. NORWAY DONT STARE AT NAKED PEOPLE: PEOPLE ARE PRETTY RELAXED ABOUT NUDITY, AND BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WILL FOR EXAMPLE CHANGE ON PUBLIC BEACHES WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT COVERING THEMSELVES UP. YOU ARE HOWEVER EXPECTED TO LOOK AWAY. DONT UNWRAP FLOWERS BEFORE YOU GIVE THEM AS A GIFT: GERMANS DO THIS. DONT ASK PEOPLE ABOUT CHURCH: MOST ATTEND NONE, AND ASKING THIS IS SEEN AS INTRUSIVE, RUDE AND DOWNRIGHT WEIRD. DONT EXPECT SPECIAL TREATMENT: PEOPLE ARE VERY INFORMAL HERE AND BEING ON A FIRST-NAME-BASIS WITH ANYONE SHORT OF THE KING IS THE NORM. EVEN THE PRIME-MINISTER OF NORWAY IS MOST OFTEN REFERRED TO BY FIRST NAME. RUSSIA DONT GIVE AN EVEN NUMBER OF FLOWERS AS A GIFT: THATS FOR DEAD FOLKS. PROPER BOUQUET WILL HAVE 1/3/5/7 FLOWERS. DONT RELY ON A CREDIT CARD: THERE ARE LOTS OF PLACES WHICH ONLY ACCEPT CASH. DONT ASSUME THE PEOPLE SUPPORT EVERYTHING THE GOVERNMENT DOES: QUITE OFTEN WE DONT. DONT CRITICIZE OUR GOVERNMENT. WE DO IT A LOT BY OURSELVES, WE DONT NEED YOUR HELP IN THAT. SINGAPORE YOU CAN GET FINED FOR A LOT OF THINGS IN SINGAPORE, INCLUDING: FEEDING THE BIRDS, SPITTING, URINATING IN PUBLIC, SMOKING IN PUBLIC, HAVING YOUR PET IN PUBLIC, EATING OR DRINKING ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, AND LITTERING, AMONG OTHER THINGS. KENYA DONT DISRESPECT RELIGION: ALMOST EVERYONE YOU MEET IS RELIGIOUS; RELIGION HERE IS ALWAYS IN FASHION, SO IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU IF YOU ARE RELIGIOUS, DONT TAKE OFFENSE BECAUSE IT IS COMMON FOR EVERYONE TO FOLLOW A RELIGION, AND AROUND 80% OF THE POPULATION ARE CHRISTIANS. DONT BE IMPATIENT: HARDLY ANYTHING RUNS ON TIME, WITH AN EXCEPTION OF A COUPLE OF BUSINESS MEETINGS AND BANK CLOSING HOURS AND MOST OTHER BUSINESSES. EVERYTHING RUNS LATE, DONT GET PISSED OFF OR IMPATIENT, LEARN TO GO WITH THE FLOW, THINGS WILL HAPPEN, JUST NOT ON TIME. DONT TALK ABOUT SEX IN MIXED COMPANY: IT IS WRONG AND IS FROWNED UPON AND PEOPLE MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE IN YOUR COMPANY AFTER THAT. DONT CALL SOMEONE BY THEIR FIRST NAME: MISS, MRS, MR., DR. AND ENGINEER SO AND SO (MOSTLY THE SURNAME) ARE TOTALLY ACCEPTED. IF YOU WANT TO CALL SOMEONE WHOSE NAME YOU DONT KNOW, REFER TO THEM AS MADAM OR SIR. YOU GET QUITE A LOT OF BONUS POINTS FOR THAT. ONLY REFER TO SOMEONE BY THEIR FIRST NAME IF THEY INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AS SUCH. NEW ZEALAND DONT CONFUSE NEW ZEALANDERS WITH AUSSIES: WE DONT LIKE IT! DONT EXPECT TO SEE KIWI BIRDS: THEY ARE ALMOST EXTINCT. IRONY! DONT MAKE FUN OF RUGBY, LORD OF THE RINGS, OR THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND: ALL BLACKS IS A RUGBY TEAM AND PROBABLY A RELIGION. HAKA IS A WAR-CRY PERFORMED BEFORE A WAR OR, NOWADAYS, A RUGBY MATCH. DO NOT MAKE FUN OF IT! KIWIS ARE PROUD OF LORD OF THE RINGS! THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND IS STILL A BIG DEAL HERE! WE STILL CELEBRATE HER BIRTHDAY AND SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO HER. DONT FREAK OUT ABOUT PEOPLE NOT WEARING SHOES: ITS PERFECTLY NORMAL TO GO ABOUT IN PUBLIC PLACES WITHOUT FOOTWEAR, AND IN SOME CASES A SHIRT. YOU WILL STILL BE SERVED. TURKEY DONT MAKE THE OKAY SIGN WITH YOUR THUMB AND FOREFINGER: THIS IS CONSIDERED OBSCENE IN TURKEY. LAY OFF THE ALCOHOL: TURKS DONT DRINK MUCH MAYBE AN OCCASIONAL GLASS OF WINE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND BEING DRUNK IS CONSIDERED A DISGRACE. DONT BLOW YOUR NOSE OR PICK YOUR TEETH IN PUBLIC: TURKS CONSIDER BOTH OF THESE IMPOLITE WHEN DONE AT A RESTAURANT, CAFE, OR BAR. INDIA DONT KISS IN PUBLIC: IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THIS CAN GET YOU INTO JAIL UNDER PUBLIC OBSCENITY (A LOT OF OUR LAWS ARE STUCK IN THE VICTORIAN ERA). DONT MAKE PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX: HUGGING AND HANDSHAKES ARE STILL FROWNED UPON IN MOST PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AMONG MEMBERS OF OPPOSITE SEX. UNLESS THE LOCAL OFFERS TO HUG OR HANDSHAKE, DONT. FRANCE DONT EXPECT A HUGE AMOUNT OF VEGAN OPTIONS: NOTIFY PEOPLE YOU VISIT AND BE CAREFUL IN WHICH RESTAURANTS YOU GO. VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE VEGAN IN FRANCE COMPARED TO SOME OTHER COUNTRIES, AND ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION IS SLOWLY IMPROVING, THE AWARENESS AND ACCEPTANCE OF IT ARE STILL QUITE POOR. SOME OLDER PEOPLE ESPECIALLY CAN CONSIDER IT A WEIRD OR EVEN RADICAL BEHAVIOR. DONT TALK ABOUT MONEY: FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN TELL YOU QUIT A JOB BECAUSE YOU WERE UNDERPAID, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT MENTION HOW MUCH EXACTLY. THERE ARE OLD TABOOS ABOUT SPEAKING OF MONEY IN THE FRENCH CULTURE, MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER IT A DIRTY TOPIC. DONT EXPECT PEOPLE TO SPEAK ENGLISH: THE FRENCH EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS BAD AT TEACHING FOREIGN LANGUAGES, WITH AN EXCESSIVE FOCUS ON READING AND WRITING COMPARED TO CONVERSATIONAL SKILLS. MANY OLDER PEOPLE WILL ONLY KNOW A BIT OF BAD AND HEAVILY ACCENTED ENGLISH AND/OR POSSIBLY GERMAN OR SPANISH. MEXICO DONT PATRONIZE PEOPLE: WERE A DEVELOPING COUNTRY AND WERE AWARE THAT SOME STUFF IS JUST BACKWARDS OVER HERE. DONT EVER IMPLY THAT YOU ARE BETTER THAN ANYONE, ESPECIALLY IF THAT HINGES ON YOU BEING A FOREIGNER. DONT BE EASILY OFFENDED: WE HAVE A HUGE SENSE OF HUMOR AS A CULTURE. NOTHING IS OUT OF BOUNDS FOR US! WELL MOCK, RIDICULE, INSULT, PICK ON AND PUT DOWN JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT, ON A REGULAR BASIS! DONT BE AFRAID TO TRY EVERYTHING: WE LOVE IT WHEN YOU TRY TO SAY THAT RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT WORD IN SPANISH, AND YOULL BE MET WITH PROUD CHEERS IF YOU BRAVE A BITE OUT OF THAT HORRIFYINGLY SPICY PEPPER, OR DOWN THAT SHOT OF TEQUILA. UNITED KINGDOM DONT CUT IN LINE: QUEUE JUMP THIS IS THE ONLY CRIME THAT THE POPULATION WOULD CONSIDER BRINGING BACK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR. DONT ASK HOW MUCH MONEY SOMEONE MAKES: INSTEAD PLAY A CURIOUS GUESSING GAME BY ASKING SOMEONE WHAT THEY DO, WHERE THEY LIVE, WHERE THEY WENT ON HOLIDAY, AND FIGURE IT OUT BY CORRELATING THIS WITH THEIR ACCENT. DONT INVITE SOMEONE TO YOUR HOME: UNLESS YOU KNOW THEM VERY VERY WELL. IRELAND DONT SAY TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU: I DONT KNOW HOW THIS PHRASE BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH IRISH PEOPLE, PERHAPS IT WAS USED IN THE DISTANT PAST. BUT ITS NOT NOW, AND ITS JUST REALLY IRRITATING. DONT ATTEMPT AN IRISH ACCENT: TO US THERE IS NO IRISH ACCENT; THERE ARE CORK ACCENTS, DUBLIN ACCENTS, KERRY ACCENTS ETC. FOR US AN ACCENT CONTAINS REAMS OF UNSPOKEN INFORMATION ABOUT A PERSON (URBAN/RURAL, SOCIAL STATUS) ASIDE FROM THE LOCATIONAL INFORMATION. DONT BE CHEAP: THE CLASSIC IS IN A ROUNDS SITUATION AT A PUB. IF SOMEONE IS OFFERING TO BUY THE FIRST ROUND, IT IS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO SAY OH IM ON A BUDGET, ILL GET MY OWN. IT IS NOT OK TO JOIN THE ROUND AND THEN NOT PAY FOR ONE. DONT CALL THE UK THE MAINLAND: AS FAR AS WERE CONCERNED, FRANCE IS THE MAINLAND.
84	HARTFORD NEARLY 200 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT OF NOTORIOUS KILLER AMY ARCHER-GILLIGAN, THE WOMAN WHO BECAME THE SUBJECT OF THE PLAY AND MOVIE "ARSENIC AND OLD LACE," WILL REMAIN SEALED AFTER THE STATE SUPREME COURT RULED MONDAY THAT THEY ARE NOT PUBLIC RECORDS. ARCHER-GILLIGAN DIED IN STATE CUSTODY IN 1962 AT WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS CONNECTICUT VALLEY HOSPITAL, WHERE SHE WAS SENTENCED TO LIVE AFTER A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE RULED HER CRIMINALLY INSANE IN 1924. ARCHER-GILLIGAN, WHO RAN A WINDSOR HOME FOR THE ELDERLY, WAS ACCUSED OF MURDERING RESIDENTS. THE STATE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION COMMISSION HAD PREVIOUSLY RULED THAT SOME OF ARCHER-GILLIGAN'S MEDICAL AND DENTAL RECORDS FROM THE 38 YEARS SHE SPENT AT CVH, SHOULD BE RELEASED. THEY WERE REQUESTED BY AN EAST HARTFORD MAN WRITING A BOOK ABOUT ARCHER-GILLIGAN, WHO WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR THE 1939 PLAY AND THE FRANK CAPRA MOVIE SEVERAL YEARS LATER. A TRIAL JUDGE AFFIRMED THE FOIC DECISION. ARCHER-GILLIGAN PLEADED GUILTY TO POISONING AT LEAST ONE MAN WHO LIVED AT HER WINDSOR NURSING HOME BY SLIPPING ARSENIC INTO HIS FOOD. INVESTIGATORS SUSPECTED AT LEAST THREE MORE VICTIMS AND POSSIBLY DOZENS MORE DIED OF ARSENIC POISONING AT THE ARCHER HOME FOR ELDERLY AND INDIGENT PERSONS AT 37 PROSPECT ST., BETWEEN 1907 AND 1916. HER ONLY CHILD IS ALSO DEAD, LEAVING NO KNOWN RELATIVES. THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTIVE SERVICES, WHICH RUNS THE HOSPITAL, AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FOUGHT THE RELEASE OF THE DOCUMENTS, ARGUING THAT THEY ARE PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS AND EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE UNDER STATE LAW. SINCE ARCHER-GILLIGAN HAS NO LIVING RELATIVES, THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION AS STEWARD OF THE RECORDS TO KEEP THEM SEALED, THEY ARGUED. THEY ALSO RAISED CONCERNS THAT RELEASING THE RECORDS COULD SET A PRECEDENT. IN THE MAJORITY OPINION, FIVE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AGREED THAT ALL OF THE RECORDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS AND THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED BY SEPARATING OUT HER DENTAL AND MEDICAL RECORDS. "WE CONCLUDE THAT THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY AFFIRMED THE [FOI] COMMISSION'S DETERMINATION THAT GILLIGAN'S MEDICAL AND DENTAL RECORDS WERE NOT EXEMPT," JUSTICE DENNIS G. EVELEIGH WROTE IN AN 18-PAGE DECISION. "OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BROAD VEIL OF SECRECY CREATED BY THE PSYCHIATRIST-PATIENT PRIVILEGE ALSO SUPPORTS OUR CONCLUSION THAT MEDICAL AND DENTAL RECORDS THAT ARE CREATED BY AN INPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY DURING THE TREATMENT OF A PATIENT ARE EXEMPT." IN A SEPARATE OPINION, JUSTICE ANDREW J. MCDONALD TOOK ISSUE WITH THE MAJORITY'S CONCLUSION THAT ALL THE RECORDS CREATED AT THE INPATIENT TREATMENT FACILITY ARE, AS A MATTER OF LAW, PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS. "THIS HEAVY-HANDED APPROACH DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS ARE NOT MEDICAL AND DENTAL RECORDS AT ALL, BUT ARE MERELY ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS AND CORRESPONDENCE HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH GILLIGAN'S PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT," MCDONALD WROTE. THE JUSTICES HAD SPENT MORE THAN AN HOUR QUESTIONING THE LAWYERS WHEN THE CASE CAME BEFORE THEM. THEIR QUESTIONS TOUCHED ON WHAT DEFINES A PUBLIC FIGURE AND WHY PATIENTS IN STATE MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS OF PRIVACY THAN THOSE IN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. THEY ALSO ASKED IF THE STATE EVEN HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RECORDS OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN DEAD FOR SO LONG AND HAS NO HEIRS SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC. ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL JACQUELINE HOELL ARGUED THAT THE MORE THAN 200 PAGES ARE PRIVILEGED PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS AND SHOULD REMAIN SEALED, JUST LIKE THEY WOULD BE FOR ANY OTHER PATIENT, WHETHER UNDER THE STATE'S CARE OR IN A PRIVATE FACILITY. "LEGITIMATE PUBLIC CONCERN FOR HOW SOMEONE IS TREATED IS NOT THE EQUIVALENT TO CURIOSITY AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS CASE," HOELL SAID. HOELL ARGUED THAT RELEASING ARCHER-GILLIGAN'S RECORDS WOULD SET A PRECEDENT THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY APPLY TO ANYONE TREATED AT A STATE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY. HOELL REPRESENTED THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. VALICIA DEE HARMON, THE COMMISSION'S ATTORNEY, ARGUED THAT THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF PUBLIC INTEREST IN ARCHER-GILLIGAN, 52 YEARS AFTER HER DEATH, AND THAT HER MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD PROVIDE A SNAPSHOT INTO THE TREATMENT GIVEN TO A HISTORICAL FIGURE. HARMON ALSO ARGUED THAT NO ONE WOULD BE HARMED BY THE RELEASE OF THE RECORDS SINCE THERE IS NO NEXT OF KIN. WRITER RON ROBILLARD FILED THE FOI REQUEST SEEKING ALL OF ARCHER-GILLIGAN'S PSYCHIATRIC AND MEDICAL RECORDS. HE IS WRITING A BOOK ABOUT ARCHER-GILLIGAN AND IS TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THE STATE TREATED THE MENTALLY ILL 90 YEARS AGO. THE STATE ORIGINALLY TOLD ROBILLARD THAT THE RECORDS HAD BEEN DESTROYED BUT THEY WERE LATER DISCOVERED IN A VAULT IN THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AT THE HOSPITAL. "I AM OBVIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED, BUT CAN'T SAY THAT I AM SURPRISED," ROBILLARD SAID. HE SAID THE DECISION LIKELY ENDS HIS PROJECT TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT ARCHER-GILLIGAN. "WITHOUT THOSE RECORDS I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO WRITE THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT HER," HE SAID. "THE NEW STUFF WAS HOW HER ILLNESS WAS DIAGNOSED AND HOW THEY TREATED HER."

LONG TERM, YOUR LAWN WILL RESPOND QUICKER TO FERTILIZER AND WATER RUNOFF WILL BE REDUCED WHEN IRRIGATING. OVERSEEDING WHEN IT COMES TO INCREASING LAWN THICKNESS AND HEALTH, OVERSEEDING CAN BE ESSENTIAL. IT CAN HELP DISCOURAGE FUTURE WEEDS WHILE ALSO AIDING RECOVERY FROM SUMMER HEAT, DISEASE AND INSECT ACTIVITY. SEEDING DURING LATE SUMMER OR EARLY FALL WILL GIVE GRASS THE MAXIMUM TIME TO DEVELOP A DEEP EXTENSIVE ROOT SYSTEM AND MATURE BEFORE THE ONSET OF WINTER STRESSES. AERATION IS RECOMMENDED WHEN OVERSEEDING TO GIVE SEEDS MORE SOIL CONTACT AND PROVIDE A MOIST, PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT REQUIRED FOR GERMINATION. FEEDING FALL FEEDING GIVES YOUR LANDSCAPE THE NUTRIENTS NEEDED TO PREPARE FOR A HEALTHY, GREEN SPRING REVIVAL. HIRING A TRAINED SPECIALIST WITH A PLAN CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR REGION WILL HELP TREES AND SHRUBS THRIVE. IF YOU FERTILIZE YOUR OWN LAWN, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE PRODUCT DIRECTIONS AND SWEEP ALL FERTILIZER THAT MAY REACH PAVEMENT BACK ONTO YOUR LAWN. MAINTAINING HEALTH AND APPEARANCE THROUGHOUT THE FALL, THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAINTAIN YOUR YARDS APPEARANCE AND HEALTH, REMOVE FALLEN TREE LEAVES AND DEBRIS FROM YOUR LAWN. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN MULCHING TREE LEAVES BACK INTO YOUR LAWN EFFECTIVELY CLEARS AWAY TREE LEAF DEBRIS THAT OTHERWISE CAN BECOME MATTED AND DAMAGE YOUR LAWN OVER THE WINTER. LOWERING THE MOWER HEIGHT BY ONE OR TWO SETTINGS THE LAST COUPLE MOWINGS BEFORE WINTER REDUCES GRASS DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH SNOW. AVOID WALKING ON FROST-COVERED LAWNS AS DOING SO MAY CAUSE BROWN FOOTPRINTS TO APPEAR LATER THAT CAN REMAIN VISIBLE UNTIL SPRING. CLEAN AND EDGE LANDSCAPE BEDS, LEAVING NO MORE THAN 2-3 INCHES OF MULCH IN THE BEDS. PRUNING PRUNING IS AN ESSENTIAL MAINTENANCE PRACTICE FOR TREES AND SHRUBS. LANDSCAPES CAN QUICKLY BECOME OVERGROWN IF NOT CARED FOR, BUT YEARLY PRUNING WILL MAINTAIN TREES AND SHRUBS TO AN IDEAL SIZE AND SHAPE. REMOVE DEAD OR DAMAGED BRANCHES FROM TREES AND SHRUBS TO PREVENT ROT ORGANISMS FROM INVADING THE TRUNK AND STEMS OF PLANTS. FOR MORE FALL LAWN CARE AND MAINTENANCE ADVICE, VISIT TRUGREEN.COM .

86	AMERICAN MINUTE WITH BILL FEDERER THE FALL OF ROME WAS A CULMINATION OF SEVERAL EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS. GREAT WALL OF CHINA: BY 220AD, THE LATER EASTERN HAN DYNASTY HAD EXTENDED SECTIONS OF THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA ALONG ITS MONGOLIAN BORDER. THIS RESULTED IN THE NORTHERN HUNS ATTACKING WEST INSTEAD OF EAST. THIS CAUSED A DOMINO EFFECT OF TRIBES MIGRATING WEST ACROSS CENTRAL ASIA, AND OVERRUNNING THE WESTERN ROMAN EMPIRE. OPEN BORDERS: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS POURED ACROSS THE ROMAN BORDERS: VISIGOTHS, OSTROGOTHS, FRANKS, ANGLOS, SAXONS, ALEMANNI, THURINGIANS, RUGIANS, JUTES, PICTS, BURGUNDIANS, LOMBARDS, ALANS, VANDALS, AS WELL AS AFRICAN BERBERS AND ARAB RAIDERS. WILL AND ARIEL DURANT WROTE IN THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (VOL. 3-CAESAR AND CHRIST, SIMON & SCHUSTER, 1944, P. 366): IF ROME HAD NOT ENGULFED SO MANY MEN OF ALIEN BLOOD IN SO BRIEF A TIME, IF SHE HAD PASSED ALL THESE NEWCOMERS THROUGH HER SCHOOLS INSTEAD OF HER SLUMS, IF SHE HAD TREATED THEM AS MEN WITH A HUNDRED POTENTIAL EXCELLENCES, IF SHE HAD OCCASIONALLY CLOSED HER GATES TO LET ASSIMILATION CATCH UP WITH INFILTRATION, SHE MIGHT HAVE GAINED NEW RACIAL AND LITERARY VITALITY FROM THE INFUSION, AND MIGHT HAVE REMAINED A ROMAN ROME, THE VOICE AND CITADEL OF THE WEST. LOSS OF COMMON LANGUAGE: AT FIRST IMMIGRANTS ASSIMILATED AND LEARNED THE LATIN LANGUAGE. THEY WORKED AS SERVANTS WITH MANY RISING TO LEADERSHIP. BUT THEN THEY CAME SO FAST THEY DID NOT LEARN LATIN, BUT INSTEAD CREATED A MIX OF LATIN WITH THEIR OWN GERMANIC, FRANKISH AND ANGLO TRIBAL TONGUES. THE UNITY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE BEGAN TO DISSOLVE. THE WELFARE STATE: BREAD AND THE CIRCUS! STARTING IN 123 BC, THE IMMENSELY POWERFUL ROMAN POLITICIAN, GAIUS GRACCHUS BEGAN APPEASING CITIZENS WITH WELFARE, A MONTHLY HAND-OUT OF A FREE DOLE (HANDOUT) OF GRAIN. ROMAN POET JUVENAL (CIRCA 100 AD) DESCRIBED HOW ROMAN EMPERORS CONTROLLED THE MASSES BY KEEPING THEM IGNORANT AND OBSESSED WITH SELF-INDULGENCE, SO THAT THEY WOULD BE DISTRACTED AND NOT THROW THEM OUT OF OFFICE, WHICH THEY MIGHT DO IF THEY REALIZED THE TRUE CONDITION OF THE EMPIRE: ALREADY LONG AGO, FROM WHEN WE SOLD OUR VOTE TO NO MAN, THE PEOPLE HAVE ABDICATED OUR DUTIES; FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ONCE UPON A TIME HANDED OUT MILITARY COMMAND, HIGH CIVIL OFFICE, LEGIONS EVERYTHING, NOW RESTRAINS ITSELF AND ANXIOUSLY HOPES FOR JUST TWO THINGS: BREAD AND CIRCUSES. THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE LESSONS OF HISTORY (P. 92): THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION AND POVERTY IN GREAT CITIES MAY COMPEL A GOVERNMENT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ENFEEBLING THE ECONOMY WITH A DOLE OR RUNNING THE RISK OF RIOT AND REVOLUTION. WELFARE AND GOVERNMENT JOBS EXPLODED, AS RECORDED IN GREAT AGES OF MAN-BARBARIAN EUROPE (NY: TIME-LIFE BOOKS, 1968, P. 39), ONE ROMAN COMMENTED: THOSE WHO LIVE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC FUNDS ARE MORE NUMEROUS THAN THOSE WHO PROVIDE THEM. CLASS WARFARE: CITY CENTERS WERE ABANDONED BY THE UPPER CLASS, WHO BOUGHT UP FARMS FROM RURAL LANDOWNERS AND TRANSFORMED THEM INTO PALATIAL ESTATES. THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (VOL. 3-CAESAR AND CHRIST, SIMON & SCHUSTER, 1944, P.90): THE ROMAN LANDOWNER DISAPPEARED NOW THAT OWNERSHIP WAS CONCENTRATED IN A FEW FAMILIES, AND A PROLETARIAT WITHOUT STAKE IN THE COUNTRY FILLED THE SLUMS OF ROME. INNER CITIES WERE DESTABILIZED, BEING ALSO PLAGUED WITH LEAD POISONING, AS WATER WAS BROUGHT IN THROUGH LEAD PIPES. (PLUMB OR PLUMBING IS THE LATIN WORD FOR LEAD.) THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE WAS LOW. SLAVERY AND SEX-TRAFFICKING ABOUNDED, ESPECIALLY OF CAPTURED PEOPLES FROM EASTERN EUROPE. SLAVS, WHICH MEANT GLORIOUS CAME TO HAVE THE INGLORIOUS MEANING OF A PERMANENT SERVANT OR SLAVE. (GREAT AGES, P. 18). TAXES: TAXES BECAME UNBEARABLE, AS COLLECTORS BECAME GREEDY FUNCTIONARIES IN A BUREAUCRACY SO HUGE AND CORRUPT. TAX COLLECTORS WERE DESCRIBED BY THE HISTORIAN SALVIAN AS MORE TERRIBLE THAN THE ENEMY. (GREAT AGES, P. 20). ARTHER FERRILL WROTE IN THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE: THE MILITARY EXPLANATION (NEW YORK: THAMES AND HUDSON LTD., 1986): THE CHIEF CAUSE OF THE AGRICULTURAL DECLINE WAS HIGH TAXATION ON THE MARGINAL LAND, DRIVING IT OUT OF CULTIVATION. THERE WAS A LOSS OF PATRIOTISM, WEALTH BEGAN TO FLEE THE EMPIRE, AND WITH IT, THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY. PRESIDENT WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON WARNED IN HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS, 1841: IT WAS THE BEAUTIFUL REMARK OF A DISTINGUISHED ENGLISH WRITER THAT IN THE ROMAN SENATE OCTAVIUS HAD A PARTY AND ANTONY A PARTY, BUT THE COMMONWEALTH HAD NONE THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY HAD FLED, AND, AVOIDING THE ABODES OF CIVILIZED MAN, HAD SOUGHT PROTECTION IN THE WILDS OF SCYTHIA OR SCANDINAVIA; AND SO UNDER THE OPERATION OF THE SAME CAUSES AND INFLUENCES IT WILL FLY FROM OUR CAPITOL AND OUR FORUMS. MORE RECENTLY, JOHN F. KENNEDY OBSERVED, JANUARY 6, 1961: PRESENT TAX LAWS MAY BE STIMULATING IN UNDUE AMOUNTS THE FLOW OF AMERICAN CAPITAL TO INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES ABROAD. OUTSOURCING: ROMES ECONOMY STAGNATED FROM A LARGE TRADE DEFICIT, AS GRAIN PRODUCTION WAS OUTSOURCED TO NORTH AFRICA. GERALD SIMONS WROTE IN GREAT AGES OF MAN-BARBARIAN EUROPE (NY: TIME-LIFE BOOKS, 1968, P. 39): AS CONQUERORS OF NORTH AFRICA, THE VANDALS CUT OFF THE EMPIRES GRAIN SUPPLY AT WILL. THIS CREATED CRITICAL FOOD SHORTAGES, WHICH IN TURN CURTAILED ROMAN COUNTERATTACKS. DEBT PRECEDED FALL: EMPEROR DIOCLETIAN IMPOSED WAGE AND PRICE CONTROLS AND FORBADE PEOPLE FROM CHANGING PROFESSIONS. CHOKING TAXES AND PERSONAL DEBT CAUSED MANY TO ABANDON THEIR MORTGAGED PROPERTY AND FLEE AS EX-PATS TO LIVE AMONGST THE BARBARIANS, RENOUNCING THEIR ROMAN CITIZENSHIP. DIOCLETIAN RESPONDED BY MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO ABANDON ONES MORTGAGED PROPERTY THUS PERMANENTLY TYING PEOPLE TO THE LAND IN WHAT BECAME IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE FEUDAL SYSTEM. ENORMOUS PUBLIC DEBT AND GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY CRIPPLED ROMES ECONOMY. THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE LESSONS OF HISTORY (P. 92): HUGE BUREAUCRATIC MACHINERY WAS UNABLE TO GOVERN THE EMPIRE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE ENORMOUS, OUT-OF-CONTROL DEBT. IN GREAT AGES OF MAN-BARBARIAN EUROPE (NY: TIME-LIFE BOOKS, 1968, P. 20), GERALD SIMONS WROTE: THE WESTERN ROMAN ECONOMY, ALREADY UNDERMINED BY FALLING PRODUCTION OF THE GREAT ROMAN ESTATES AND AN UNFAVORABLE BALANCE OF TRADE THAT SIPHONED OFF GOLD TO THE EAST, HAD NOW RUN OUT OF MONEY. SELF-PROMOTING & CORRUPT POLITICIANS: THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE LESSONS OF HISTORY (P. 92): THE EDUCATED AND SKILLED PURSUED BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL SUCCESS TO THE NEGLECT OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICS. RICHARD A. TODD WROTE IN THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (EERDMANS HANDBOOK TO THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY, GRAND RAPIDS, MI: WM. B. EERDMANS CO., 1977, P. 184): THE CHURCH, WHILE PREACHING AGAINST ABUSES, CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE BY DISCOURAGING GOOD CHRISTIANS FROM HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE. VIOLENT ENTERTAINMENT: THE CIRCUS MAXIMUS AND COLISEUM WERE PACKED WITH CROWDS OF ROMANS ENGROSSED WITH VIOLENT ENTERTAINMENT, GAMES, CHARIOT RACES, AND UNTIL 404 AD, GLADIATORS FIGHTING TO THE DEATH. GERALD SIMONS WROTE IN GREAT AGES OF MAN-BARBARIAN EUROPE (NY: TIME-LIFE BOOKS, 1968, P. 20): IN THE CAUSAL BRUTALITY OF ITS PUBLIC SPECTACLES, IN A RAMPANT IMMORALITY THAT EVEN CHRISTIANITY COULD NOT CHECK. EXPOSURE OF UNWANTED INFANTS: ROMAN DEMOGRAPHICS CHANGED AS FAMILIES HAD FEWER CHILDREN. SOME WOULD SELL UNWANTED CHILDREN INTO SLAVERY OR LEAVE THEM OUTSIDE EXPOSED TO THE WEATHER TO DIE, AS WAS THE PRACTICE TILL 374AD. THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION, VOL. 3-CAESAR AND CHRIST (SIMON & SCHUSTER, 1944, P. 134): CHILDREN WERE NOW LUXURIES WHICH ONLY THE POOR COULD AFFORD. IMMORALITY: ROME WAS CORRUPTED WITH COURT FAVORITISM, THE PATRONAGE SYSTEM, INJUSTICE IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM, INFIDELITY, PERVERTED BATHHOUSES, SEXUAL IMMORALITY, GLUTTONY, AND GYMNASIUMS (GYM BEING THE GREEK WORD FOR NAKED). 5TH-CENTURY HISTORIAN SALVIAN WROTE: FOR ALL THE LURID ROMAN TALES OF THEIR ATROCITIESTHE BARBARIANS DISPLAYEDA GOOD DEAL MORE FIDELITY TO THEIR WIVES. (GREAT AGES, P. 13.) SALVIAN CONTINUED: O ROMAN PEOPLE BE ASHAMED; BE ASHAMED OF YOUR LIVES. ALMOST NO CITIES ARE FREE OF EVIL DENS, ARE ALTOGETHER FREE OF IMPURITIES, EXCEPT THE CITIES IN WHICH THE BARBARIANS HAVE BEGUN TO LIVE LET NOBODY THINK OTHERWISE, THE VICES OF OUR BAD LIVES HAVE ALONE CONQUERED US THE GOTHS LIE, BUT ARE CHASTE, THE FRANKS LIE, BUT ARE GENEROUS, THE SAXONS ARE SAVAGE IN CRUELTYBUT ARE ADMIRABLE IN CHASTITY WHAT HOPE CAN THERE BE FOR THE ROMANS WHEN THE BARBARIANS ARE MORE PURE THAN THEY? SAMUEL ADAMS WROTE TO JOHN SCOLLAY OF BOSTON, APRIL 30, 1776: THE DIMINUTION OF PUBLIC VIRTUE IS USUALLY ATTENDED WITH THAT OF PUBLIC HAPPINESS, AND THE PUBLIC LIBERTY WILL NOT LONG SURVIVE THE TOTAL EXTINCTION OF MORALS. THE ROMAN EMPIRE, SAYS THE HISTORIAN, MUST HAVE SUNK, THOUGH THE GOTHS HAD NOT INVADED IT. WHY? BECAUSE THE ROMAN VIRTUE WAS SUNK.' MILITARY CUTS: THOUGH MILITARILY SUPERIOR AND MARCHING ON ADVANCED ROAD SYSTEMS, THE HIGHLY TRAINED ROMAN LEGIONS WERE STRAINED FIGHTING CONFLICTS FROM THE RHINE RIVER TO THE SASSANID PERSIAN EMPIRE. ROMAN BORDERS WERE OVER-EXTENDED AND THE MILITARY DEFENDING THEM WAS CUT BACK TO DANGEROUSLY LOW RANKS. THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (VOL. 3-CAESAR AND CHRIST, SIMON & SCHUSTER, 1944, P.90): THE NEW GENERATION, HAVING INHERITED WORLD MASTERY, HAD NO TIME OR INCLINATION TO DEFEND IT; THAT READINESS FOR WAR WHICH HAD CHARACTERIZED THE ROMAN LANDOWNER DISAPPEARED. TERRORIST ATTACKS: CALLED THE SCOURGE OF GOD, ATTILA THE HUN WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE ANTI-CHRIST AS HE DEVASTATED EUROPE WITH HIS HALF-MILLION WARRIORS. AQUILEIA, ONE OF THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME, WAS SO COMPLETELY DESTROYED THAT INHABITANTS RAN INTO THE OCEAN, HAMMERED DOWN LOGS AND LIVED ON PLATFORMS WHICH GREW INTO THE CITY OF VENICE. STE. GENEVIEVE CALLED PARIS TO PRAY IN 451AD AND FOR SOME REASON ATTILA TURNED ASIDE SPARING THE CITY. POPE LEO RODE OUT TO MEET ATTILA IN 452AD, AND PERSUADED HIM NOT TO SACK ROME, DELAYING THE THE CITYS FALL 24 MORE YEARS. FINALLY THE BARBARIAN CHIEFTAIN ODOACER ATTACKED. ROME IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE OFFICIALLY FALLEN ON SEPTEMBER 4, 476AD. THE MORAL LIBERAL CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, WILLIAM J.

87	HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED HOW PEOPLE WHO LIVE, WORK AND STUDY IN LONDON USE SOCIAL MEDIA? IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH LONDON? DO MORE FEMALES USE SNAPCHAT THAN MALES? WE THOUGHT THE SAME AND DECIDED TO FIND OUT THE ANSWER FOR OURSELVES! LINK HUMANS, TOGETHER WITH SOCIAL MEDIA LONDON SURVEYED PEOPLE WHO WORK AND LIVE IN LONDON AND ASKED QUESTIONS BASED ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT CATEGORIES: TRAVEL RELATIONSHIPS FOOD WORD FASHION SOCIAL MEDIA BRANDS WE THOUGHT THAT BY PROVIDING THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, WE COULD FIND OUT WHY CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE USING SOCIAL MEDIA, IF THERE ARE COMMON TRENDS AND HOW THIS CAN HELP BRANDS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS IN THE FUTURE FOR CONTENT AND TARGETING PURPOSES. SO, WHO REALLY IS USING SOCIAL MEDIA IN LONDON AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SOCIAL SECRETS THAT WE FOUND OUT? SOCIAL MEDIA IN TERMS OF PRIVACY, WE DISCOVERED THAT IN LONDON,51% OF FEMALES PREFER TO USE A PRIVATE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT, WHEREAS ONLY 28.21% OF MALES WOULD USE PRIVATE ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION TO THIS, WE WANTED TO FIND OUT LONDONS FAVOURITE SOCIAL NETWORK.TWITTER RANKED FIRST AS FAVOURITE SOCIAL NETWORK IN OUR SURVEY, INSTAGRAM CAME SECOND AND FACEBOOK RANKED 3RD. IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE THE RISE OF THE VISUAL NETWORK AND HOW POPULAR IT IS IN COMPARISON TO FACEBOOK. ON THE TOPIC OF VISUAL NETWORKS, WE ALSO WANTED TO DISCOVER RESPONDENTS FAVOURITE SOCIAL NETWORK FOR VIDEO, 71.67% OF RESPONDENTS CHOSE YOUTUBE AS THEIR FAVOURITE. AN INTERESTING STATISTIC WAS HOW POPULAR SNAPCHAT IS AMONGST CERTAIN AGE GROUPS. WE FOUND THAT 35.71% OF 18-24 YEAR OLDS USE SNAPCHAT DAILY AND THIS WAS THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OUT OF ANY OF THE POSSIBLE AGE GROUPS. BRANDS IT WAS IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT TAKEAWAYS FOR BRANDS FROM THIS STUDY. BRANDS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO TARGET AND ENGAGE WITH CERTAIN AUDIENCES, TO DO THAT THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEIR AUDIENCE WANT FROM THEM ON SOCIAL NETWORKS. WE FOUND THAT75.83% OF RESPONDENTS FOLLOW BRANDS FOR INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING CONTENT AND PROMOTIONS AND DISCOUNTS CAME NEXT IN TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE WANT FROM BRANDS. WHAT WASNT SO POPULAR WAS JOB LISTINGS AND PARTICIPATING IN DISCUSSIONS WHICH ONLY 16.67%SAID THEY WANTED FROM BRANDS. PERHAPS BRANDS NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON VARIED CONTENT THAT IS ENTERTAINING FOR VARIOUS GROUPS OF PEOPLE. SHAREABLE CONTENT IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT! 52.38% OF 18-24 YEAR OLDS CONSIDER COMPETITIONS TO BE IMPORTANT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHEN IT COMES TO BRANDS, SO PERHAPS THIS IS THE WAY TO ATTRACT MILLENNIALS AND A YOUNGER GENERATION. POLITICS AND EVENTS WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AT NETWORKING EVENTS AND HOW SOCIAL MEDIA IS INCORPORATED INTO THAT COMMUNICATION. SURPRISINGLY, WE FOUND THAT71.54% OF PEOPLE WOULD GIVE OUT THEIR TWITTER HANDLE AT AN EVENT AND 62.60% WOULD GIVE OUT THEIR EMAIL! LINKEDIN WAS NOT IN THE TOP 2 ALTHOUGH MANY MAY HAVE EXPECTED IT TO BE. HOWEVER, 90.23% OF RESPONDENTS SAID THEY WOULD DEFINITELY CONNECT ON LINKEDIN AFTER AN EVENT. WORK SOCIAL MEDIA AND WORK ARE MERGING MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. NOT ONLY HAS THERE BEEN AN INCREASE IN JOBS IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA INDUSTRY, PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA AT WORK FOR BOTH WORK PURPOSES AND TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES. THIS IS PROVEN THROUGH THE RESULTS WE GATHERED IN OUR SURVEY:73.23% OF RESPONDENTS SPEND 1 HOUR+ AT WORK DAILY AND88.55% USE SOCIAL MEDIA FOR WORK PURPOSES. IN TERMS OF WHAT LONDONERS WANT FROM BRANDS THAT THEY WISH TO WORK FOR IN THE FUTURE89.13% OF FEMALES EXPECT JOB LISTINGS ON SOCIAL MEDIA FROM POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS AND 44.57% EXPECT INTERVIEW TIPS. PERHAPS BRANDS SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF THIS, IT COULD BE A WAY TO RECRUIT MORE POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES IF THEY ARE BEING GIVEN WHAT THEY ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING FROM CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, IN ADDITION TO THIS, 92.31% OF 18-24 YEAR OLDS USE FACEBOOK AT UNIVERSITY SO THIS NETWORK WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO RECRUIT AND CREATE JOB POSTINGS. TO READ MORE ABOUT THE STATISTICS WE GATHERED INCLUDING INFORMATION REGARDING THE FOOD INDUSTRY, FASHION AND RELATIONSHIPTAKE A LOOK AT THE INFOGRAPHICS BELOW WHICH DISPLAY THE MOST SHOCKING FACTS AND FUNNY FIGURES!
88	TORONTO: PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI'S THREE-DAY VISIT TO CANADA EARLIER THIS YEAR COST CANADIAN TAXPAYERS 373,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS (APPROXIMATELY RS. 1,87,06,539.43). THIS INCLUDES INCLUDING 80,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS ON RECEPTIONS AND 106,400 CANADIAN DOLLARS ON A MOTORCADE. THE EXPENSES INCLUDED 10,448 DOLLARS ON HOTEL ROOMS, 30,000 DOLLARS ON AUDIO VISUAL EQUIPMENT, 21,708 DOLLARS ON UNSPECIFIED CONSULTANTS, 73,213 DOLLARS ON PUBLIC SERVANTS' TRAVEL, 14,790 DOLLARS ON HEALTH SERVICES, 3,65,654 DOLLARS ON FLOWERS AND WREATHS, 1,584 DOLLARS ON GIFTS, 5,981 DOLLARS ON INTERPRETERS AND TRANSLATION AND 75 DOLLARS FOR A FLAG. THE BILL DID NOT INCLUDE SECURITY COSTS, A REPORT SAID. THE LARGEST EXPENSE ON A GATHERING AT AN ARENA IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO, AT WHICH CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER AND CONSERVATIVE LEADER STEPHEN HARPER SPOKE TO 10,000 MEMBERS OF THE INDO-CANADIAN COMMUNITY AND MODI WAS FETED, WAS HOWEVER NOT BORNE BY CANADIAN TAXPAYERS BUT BY PRIVATE CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES. THE EVENT AT THE RICOH COLISEUM COST ABOUT 600,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS, NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF INDO-CANADIANS' PRESIDENT AZAD KUMAR KAUSHIK SAID. THE EVENT BECAME CONTROVERSIAL AS IT GAVE A POLITICAL BOOST TO PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY (PCP) MP PATRICK BROWN, WHO WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR LEADERSHIP OF ONTARIO PROVINCE. KAUSHIK, HOWEVER, SAID, "WE DID NOT LOOK AT IT FROM AN ELECTORAL PERSPECTIVE. OUR GOAL WAS TO CREATE BONDING BETWEEN INDIA AND CANADA." HE SAID BY ORGANISING THIS MEGA RECEPTION FOR MODI, THE GROUP WANTED TO PROMOTE ENHANCED INVESTMENT AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS REMIND THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT THAT CANADA IS HOME TO AN IMPORTANT DIASPORA WHOSE NEEDS SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED. MEANWHILE, TIMMINS JAMES BAY MPP GILLES BISSON HAS DEMANDED THAT BROWN, WHO IS NOW LEADER OF THE PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVES, SHOULD PAY TAXPAYERS BACK FOR SOME OF THE COST OF THE MODI VISIT. "YOU CAN'T HAVE SOMEBODY DO A POLITICAL ACTIVITY AND THEN HAVE IT PAID BY THE STATE," BISSON SAID. "IT WAS A PRETTY BIG THING FOR BROWN'S LEADERSHIP BID, TO HAVE THIS PERSON SHOW UP, AND SAY HE'S MY BOY, ESPECIALLY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT HE WAS TRYING TO GET ALL KINDS OF MEMBERSHIPS SIGNED UP TO," HE SAID. BISSON SAID HE WELCOMED MODI'S VISIT TO CANADA BUT FELT BROWN SHOULD REPAY SOME OF THE TRAVEL AND SECURITY COSTS THAT TAXPAYERS BORE TO HELP HIM CAMPAIGN. (WITH AGENCY INPUTS)
89	BOSTON, MA SINCE 1963, KATHARINE DIXON DUKAKIS, BETTER KNOWN AS KITTY, FAITHFULLY STOOD BY THE SIDE OF HER HUSBAND, WHOM SHE HAD JUST MARRIED, WHO WAS JUST BEGINNING WHAT WAS TO BE A LONG AND ILLUSTRIOUS POLITICAL CAREER. HIS NAME, MICHAEL STANLEY DUKAKIS A MEMBER OF THE MASSACHUSETTS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM 1963 UNTIL 1971, GOVERNOR THE STATE FROM 1975 TO 1979 AND AGAIN FROM 1983 TO 1991, AND THE 1988 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE. ONLY THE SECOND GREEK-AMERICAN GOVERNOR IN U.S. HISTORY SPIRO AGNEW (MD) WAS THE FIRST DUKAKIS ARGUABLY HAS ECLIPSED AGNEW, WHO WAS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FROM 1969 TO 1973, AS THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE GREEK-AMERICAN POLITICIAN OF ALL TIME. THROUGHOUT MUCH OF DUKAKIS POLITICAL CAREER, KITTY SUFFERED SOMETIMES SILENTLY, SOMETIMES INEVITABLY IN THE PUBLIC EYE WITH BOUTS OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE. NOW THAT HER HUSBAND IS OUT OF OFFICE, SHE IS NOT ONLY OPEN ABOUT THOSE ABUSES WHICH BECAME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE DECADES AGO BUT ALSO ABOUT HER DEPRESSION AND THE REVOLUTIONARY MANNER THROUGH WHICH SHE TREATED IT. IN FACT, SHE AND THE FORMER GOVERNOR PUBLICLY CONVEY THE MAGNIFICENT BENEFITS OF ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY (ECT). ECT UNQUESTIONABLY SAVED HER LIFE, GOVERNOR DUKAKIS TOLD THE NATIONAL HERALD, REGARDING THE THERAPYS REMARKABLE EFFECTS ON HIS WIFES CONDITION. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH POLITICO, MASSACHUSETTS FORMER FIRST COUPLE DISCUSS THE SAGA THAT HAS LED TO THEIR SHARING A PROMISING EMERGENCE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. KITTY VOLUNTARILY CHECKED INTO MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL IN JUNE 2001 AS JANE DEE, POLITICO REPORTS, FOR TREATMENT FOR SEVERE DEPRESSION. THANKS TO ECT, SHE IMMEDIATELY FELT MUCH BETTER WELL ENOUGH, IN FACT, TO JOIN HER HUSBAND IN CELEBRATING THEIR 38 TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY THE VERY NEXT DAY. THERE WERE NEGATIVE STIGMAS ATTACHED TO ECT, PARTICULARLY MADE PREVALENT BY THE OSCAR-WINNING 1975 FILM ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST KITTY HERSELF TOLD POLITICO SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AS SHE ENTERED THE HOSPITAL FOR HER FIRST TREATMENT. BUT THE DUKAKISES SOON REALIZED THAT DESPITE PERCEPTION, ECT WAS WONDERFULLY SUCCESSFUL. ACCORDINGLY, KITTY DECIDED SHE NO LONGER WANTED TO BE ANONYMOUS. AS POLITICO DESCRIBES, THEY HAD A PLATFORM TO ADVOCATE A MEDICAL TREATMENT THAT, DESPITE ITS MASSIVE IMAGE PROBLEM, IS WIDELY CREDITED WITH SAVING LIVES AND SETTING PATIENTS ONCE CRIPPLED WITH DEPRESSION ON THE ROAD TO HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE FUTURES. IN THE PROCESS, THE DUKAKISES HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES TO BE THE UNEXPECTED CHAMPIONS OF ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL AND MISUNDERSTOOD BUT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PROCEDURES IN MODERN MEDICINE. IN FACT, KITTY IS THE ONE DRAWING THE BIGGEST CROWDS THESE DAYS, HER CELEBRITY POLITICIAN HUSBAND TELLS POLITICO. BY COMPARISON, I ONLY GET POLITE APPLAUSE ITS PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY. DIET PILLS THE ADDICTION FOR MRS. DUKAKIS STARTED IN THE 1950S, WHEN SHE BEGAN SNEAKING HER MOTHERS DIET PILLS A EUPHEMISM AT THE TIME FOR AMPHETAMINES, OR SPEED, POLITICO REPORTED. THE HABIT GREW AND IT WASNT UNTIL 1974 WHEN DUKAKIS LEARNED ABOUT IT AND ASKED HER TO STOP. SHE TRIED, BUT COULDNT SHAKE THE HABIT FOR GOOD. KITTY FINALLY ENTERED REHABILITATION AND KICKED THE HABIT EIGHT YEARS LATER. BUT ALCOHOL REPLACED THE DRUGS, POLITICO WROTE, WHICH EXPERTS SAY IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION TO USE BOTH AS SELF-MEDICATION. SHE WAS ABLE TO TEMPER HER USE OF ALCOHOL DURING DUKAKIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, BUT INTENSIFIED HER DRINKING AFTER THE ELECTION WAS OVER. ECT-EPTIONAL NOTHING SEEMED TO WORK, UNTIL ECT. AS POLITICO DESCRIBES, AN ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY TREATMENT IS SUPPOSED TO RESET THE BRAIN TO DISRUPT THE PATIENTS DEPRESSION KIND OF LIKE REBOOTING A COMPUTER. WITH THE PATIENT UNDER ANESTHESIA, A SMALL CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY IS USED TO SPARK A GRAND MAL SEIZURE. DR. CHARLES WELCH, ONE OF THE NATIONS TOP EXPERTS ON ECT AND KITTYS PSYCHIATRIST, EXPLAINS THAT THE RESULTING SEIZURE IS THE NEUROLOGICAL EQUIVALENT OF FLICKING ON AND OFF EVERY LIGHT BULB IN NEW YORK CITY THREE TIMES IN ONE SECONDA MASSIVE EVENT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO JOLT THE BRAIN BACK INTO ITS NORMAL STATE. ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF PATIENTS WHO DO A SERIES OF ECT WHICH COULD RANGE FROM SIX TO 12 TREATMENTS GIVEN OVER A SERIES OF WEEKS GO INTO REMISSION. IT HAS THE HIGHEST REMISSION RATE OF ANY OF THE TREATMENTS THAT EXIST FOR DEPRESSION, SAYS DR. SARAH LISANBY, THE CHAIR OF THE PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES DEPARTMENT AT THE DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. LIKE OTHER CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS, THAT REMISSION IS NOT OFTEN PERMANENT. PATIENTS TYPICALLY GO ON ANTI-DEPRESSANT MEDICATION AFTER TREATMENT AND HAVE FOLLOW UP ECT TREATMENTS WHEN SIGNS OF DEPRESSION RETURN. LISANBY AND OTHER PSYCHIATRISTS SAY THAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FACING ECT NOW IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT REMISSION MORE PERMANENT. KITTY HAS TRAVELED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SINGING THE PRAISES OF ECT AND NEXT YEAR PLANS TO APPEAR FOR THE SECOND TIME AT AN ECT CONFERENCE IN SCANDINAVIA, POLITICO REPORTS, WHERE THAT THERAPY IS MORE WIDELY ACCEPTED THAN IN THE UNITED STATES. I CANT IMAGINE WHAT LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE WITHOUT ECT, SHE TELLS POLITICO. IT REALLY SAVED MY LIFE. ECT IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY ACCEPTED TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION, AND, IN FACT, IS BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR SEVERE DEPRESSION THERE IS. IT IS RELATIVELY QUICK AND PAINLESS, DUKAKIS TOLD TNH. SOMETIMES JUST ONE SERIES OF FIVE OR SIX TREATMENTS TAKES CARE OF THE PROBLEM FOR THE LONG TERM. IN OTHER CASES LIKE KITTYS, SHE NOW HAS ECT MAINTENANCE ONE TREATMENT ONCE A MONTH, AND SHE TAKES NO MEDICATION, WHICH NEVER HELPED HER ANYWAY. SHE NOW CHAIRS AN ECT SUPPORT GROUP, THE GOVERNOR CONTINUED, SPEAKS AT GRAND ROUNDS AT HOSPITALS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND IS THE CO-AUTHOR OF THE BOOK, SHOCK: THE HEALING POWER OF ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY, WHICH IS WIDELY USED AND RECOMMENDED BY PSYCHIATRISTS TO THEIR PATIENTS. AWARENESS AS ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION APPROACHES, DUKAKIS, A FIRSTHAND VETERAN OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS, WOULD LIKE MENTAL HEALTH BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT. I CERTAINLY HOPE THE CANDIDATES FOR THE PRESIDENCY WILL BE TALKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE CAMPAIGN. IT IS NOT, AND SHOULD NOT, BE A POLITICAL ISSUE, DUKAKIS BELIEVES, YET ONE THAT ALL POLITICIANS SHOULD ADDRESS. THERE IS NOTHING PARTISAN ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS. NOW, WITH THE PASSAGE BY THE CONGRESS OF BOTH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MENTAL HEALTH PARITY, WHICH REQUIRES INSURERS TO COVER MENTAL HEALTH JUST THE WAY THEY COVER ALL OTHER KINDS OF HEALTH, WE COULD BE ON THE THRESHOLD OF A HUGE BREAKTHROUGH IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THIS COUNTRY. THE POST APPEARED FIRST ON THE NATIONAL HERALD .
90	PROVERBS TEACH WISDOM FOR THE MOST PART, THESE PROVERBS, KNOWN AS WISDOM LITERATURE, ARE A COLLECTION WRITTEN BY KING SOLOMON, DAVIDS SON, TO WHOM GOD GAVE GREAT WISDOM. 1 KINGS 4:32 ATTRIBUTES OVER 3000 PROVERBS TO KING SOLOMON. THE PROVERBS FOCUS ON WISDOM AS APPLIED TO ALMOST EVERY FACET OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIP. THERE ARE FREQUENT USES OF METAPHORS, SIMILES, AND FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE AMONG THE VARIOUS PROVERBS. CONTRASTS AND COMPARISONS ARE ALSO COMMON. 1:2-4 THEIR PURPOSE IS TO TEACH PEOPLE WISDOM AND DISCIPLINE,TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE INSIGHTS OF THE WISETO TEACH PEOPLE TO LIVE DISCIPLINED AND SUCCESSFUL LIVES,TO HELP THEM DO WHAT IS RIGHT, JUST, AND FAIR. THESE PROVERBS WILL GIVE INSIGHT TO THE SIMPLE, KNOWLEDGE AND DISCERNMENT TO THE YOUNG. THE WISE BECOME WISER AND THOSE WITH UNDERSTANDING ARE GIVEN GUIDANCE. 1:7 FEAR OF THE LORD IS THE FOUNDATION OF TRUE KNOWLEDGE, BUT FOOLS DESPISE WISDOM AND DISCIPLINE. TRUE KNOWLEDGE BEGINS WITH A REVERENT RESPECT FOR THE LORD. THE WORD FOOL REFERS TO A PERSON WHO IS ARROGANT AND SELF-SUFFICIENT, THINKING AND BEHAVING AS IF THERE IS NO GOD. 1:20WISDOM SHOUTS IN THE STREETS. 1:23COME AND LISTEN TO MY COUNSEL.ILL SHARE MY HEART WITH YOU AND MAKE YOU WISE. 1:32-33FOR SIMPLETONS TURN AWAY FROM METO DEATH.FOOLS ARE DESTROYED BY THEIR OWN COMPLACENCY. BUT ALL WHO LISTEN TO ME WILL LIVE IN PEACE,UNTROUBLED BY FEAR OF HARM. THE BENEFIT OF WISDOM IS WE LEARN WHAT IT MEANS TO FEAR THE LORD. 2:2-4 TUNE YOUR EARS TO WISDOM, AND CONCENTRATE ON UNDERSTANDING. CRY OUT FOR INSIGHT,AND ASK FOR UNDERSTANDING.SEARCH FOR THEM AS YOU WOULD FOR SILVER;SEEK THEM LIKE HIDDEN TREASURES. 2:6-8FOR THE LORD GRANTS WISDOM! FROM HIS MOUTH COME KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING.HE GRANTS A TREASURE OF COMMON SENSE TO THE HONEST.HE IS A SHIELD TO THOSE WHO WALK WITH INTEGRITY. HE GUARDS THE PATHS OF THE JUSTAND PROTECTS THOSE WHO ARE FAITHFUL TO HIM. 2:9-11 YOU WILL FIND THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. WISE CHOICES WILL WATCH OVER YOU. UNDERSTANDING WILL KEEP YOU SAFE. 2:12 WISDOM WILL SAVE YOU FROM EVIL PEOPLE 2:16 WISDOM WILL SAVE YOU FROM THE IMMORAL WOMAN. 2:20-22 FOLLOW THE STEPS OF GOOD MEN. FOR ONLY THE GODLY WILL LIVE IN THE LAND, AND THOSE WITH INTEGRITY WILL REMAIN IN IT. BUT THE WICKED WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE LAND,AND THE TREACHEROUS WILL BE UPROOTED. THE PURPOSE OF THE PROVERBS IS TO PROVIDE WISDOM, WHICH LEADS TO GOOD CHOICES AND A LIFE OF INTEGRITY. PAUL ENCOURAGES GIVING PAUL BRIEFLY ADDRESSES THE TOPIC OF GIVING AS FUNDS WERE BEING COLLECTED FOR THOSE IN NEED IN JERUSALEM. THE TIME AND FREQUENCY FOR GIVING: 16:2 ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH WEEK YOU SHOULD EACH PUT ASIDE A PORTION OF THE MONEY YOU HAVE EARNED. GIVING IS TO BE DONE IN A PURPOSEFUL AND THOUGHTFUL MANNER, ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT GOD HAS PROSPERED EACH INDIVIDUAL. AS PAUL CLOSES THIS LETTER TO THE CORINTHIAN CHURCH HE MENTIONS HIS CURRENT AND FUTURE PLANS, WHILE MAKING NOTE OF FELLOW BELIEVERS WHO SERVE WITH DEVOTION.

91	JEPKEMOI LAUNCHED AN INNOVATIVE MARKETING AND PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM IN 2009. SHE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO CLIENT NEEDS AND QUICKLY GAINED A SOLID FOOTHOLD IN THE NAIROBI, AND LATER MOMBASA, MARKET. HER TOP LINE REVENUES TRIPLED EACH YEAR BETWEEN 2010 AND 2012 AND DOUBLED AFTERWARDS UNTIL SALES TOOK A NOSEDIVE IN 2014. HALFWAY THROUGH 2015, JEPKEMOI DECIDED TO SEND OUT ONLINE SURVEYS TO HER EXISTING, FORMER AND PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS. MUCH TO HER DISMAY, QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS INDICATED A MARKET PERCEPTION THAT HER FIRMS ONCE COVETED CREATIVITY HAD DISSIPATED AND WOULD-BE CLIENTS VIEWED THE COMPANY AS DECIDEDLY NOT INNOVATIVE. PUZZLED, JEPKEMOI ATTEMPTED TO THINK THROUGH WHAT UNDERPINNED THE DISMAL FEEDBACK. INITIALLY TEMPTED TO BLAME INCREASED COMPETITION, SHE DECIDED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. THE ONLY MAJOR CHANGE IN HER BUSINESS INVOLVED HIRING OF A NEW CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER (CMO) IN FEBRUARY 2014. HOWEVER, JEPKEMOI THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY THAT THE CMO CHANGE COULD HAVE LED TO THE DEMISE OF THE FIRMS INNOVATION. SHE VIEWED THE CMO AS A GO-GETTER, ORGANISED AND MUCH IN CONTROL OF ALL EXTERNAL ASPECTS OF THE MARKETING AND PUBLIC RELATIONS BUSINESS. JEPKEMOI DECIDED TO SET UP A BREAKFAST MEETING WITH A FORMER MBA COLLEAGUE WHO ALWAYS SEEMED TO KNOW STRATEGY AND ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENT MATTERS. BETWEEN SIPS OF COFFEE, HER FRIEND EXPLAINED THE DELICATE BALANCE OF MAINTAINING CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION IN A COMPANY. SHE RECOMMENDED THAT JEPKEMOI USE AN INTERNAL SURVEY OF HER STAFF TO GAUGE THEIR CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS TOWARDS INNOVATION. THE FRIEND POINTED OUT HOW RESEARCHERS LIKE SCOTT HELM AND FREDRIK ANDERSSON EMPLOY THE INNOVATION TOOL IN SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS BUSINESSES LIKE HERS. EAGER TO DIAGNOSE ANY ISSUES AND SAVE HER FIRM, JEPKEMOI QUICKLY DOWNLOADED THE SURVEY TOOL AND OBTAINED RESPONSES FROM HER ENTIRE TEAM. AFTERWARDS, NOT ONLY DID THE RESULTS SURPRISE HER, BUT SO DID THE RESEARCH FRAMEWORKS IMPLICATIONS FOR WHAT LEADS TO AN INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE BUSINESS. JEPKEMOI, LIKE MOST EXECUTIVES, DID NOT GRASP THE ROOT INTERNAL ANTECEDENTS THAT FOSTER EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION. RESEARCH BY ROBERT DEVELLIS SHOWS THAT MANAGERS CAN PREDICT FUTURE INNOVATION SUCCESS BY THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEIR EMPLOYEES PERCEIVE THE FOLLOWING THREE CREATIVE DRIVERS: PROACTIVENESS, RISK TAKING AND INNOVATION ORIENTATION. EXECUTIVES MUST FOSTER THESE THREE CAUSES OF INNOVATION TO BENEFIT FROM GREATER CREATIVITY. FIRST, DO EMPLOYEES FEEL THAT PROACTIVENESS IS VALUED OR FROWNED UPON? MOST EXECUTIVES PREFER PROACTIVE EMPLOYEES. HOWEVER, THE RIGIDITY, JEALOUSY AND COMPETITIVE NATURE WITHIN OFFICES OFTEN OVERRULES THE EXECUTIVES DESIRE FOR A PROACTIVE WORKFORCE. SO ONE MUST EXAMINE HOW EMPLOYEES TRULY FEEL. FURTHER, THE EXECUTIVE MUST LOOK AT HIS OR HER PAST PERFORMANCE WITH REGARDS TO PROACTIVENESS. IS YOUR FIRM SELDOM OR OFTEN THE FIRST ORGANISATION TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES, ADMINISTRATIVE TECHNIQUES OR OPERATING PROCESSES? DOES YOUR COMPANY EXPLOIT OR LAG CHANGES IN THE FIELD? ALSO, DO YOU PROVIDE THE LEAD FOR SIMILAR SERVICE PROVIDERS OR YOU FOLLOW OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS? THE TOUGH INTROSPECTIVE QUESTIONS CONTINUE WHEN ASSESSING YOUR EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISATIONS TOLERANCE AND HISTORY OF RISK TAKING. IF YOU HARSHLY PUNISH ERRANT OUTCOMES DESPITE CAREFUL PRE-PLANNING, THEN YOU SQUASH RISK TAKING. EMPLOYEES WHO FEEL EXPOSED TO CASTIGATION FOR TAKING CHANCES BECOME DRASTICALLY LESS CREATIVE IN THEIR WORKPLACE. ADDITIONALLY, DOES YOUR COMPANY SPECIFICALLY CONDUCT ITSELF IN LINE WITH THE BEHAVIOURAL NORMS OF YOUR INDUSTRY OR DO YOU BREAK OUTSIDE THE BOX OF NORMAL WORKPLACE REPORTING TIMES, MANNERS OF DRESS, EMPLOYEE TEAM REPORTING OR STAFF REWARDS? DO YOU STAY IN SAFE TERRITORY BY ACQUIRING NEW PROJECTS THAT FIT WITH YOUR PUBLIC IMAGE OR ALLOW YOUR FIRM TO TAKE ON NEW PROJECTS THAT WILL ALTER ITS PUBLIC IMAGE? NEXT, DO YOUR DECISIONS MAINTAIN OR CREATE CHANGES IN STAFF STABILITY? THE ANSWER TO THESE QUESTIONS POINT TO THE AMOUNT OF ORGANISATIONAL RISK YOU TAKE. FINALLY, LOOK INTO INNOVATION ORIENTATION ITSELF. DO YOU REWARD NEW WAYS OF ACCOMPLISHING TASKS? DO YOU HOLD INTERNAL COMPETITIONS FOR THE MOST CREATIVE SOLUTIONS? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HELD AN INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY WORKSHOP FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES? ORGANISATIONALLY, DOES YOUR FIRM RETAIN A HISTORY OF STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR MAINTAIN TRIED-AND-TRUE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES? CAN YOUR FIRM BOAST A RECORD OF SOLID DEVELOPMENT OF NEW INTERNAL PROCESSES OR THE USE OF ESTABLISHED METHODS? HAVE YOU INTRODUCED MULTIPLE NEW PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND POLICIES IN THE PAST OR INTRODUCED FEW OR NONE? WERE MOST MODIFICATIONS IN INTERNAL PROCESSES, SERVICES, PRODUCTS AND POLICIES MAJOR CHANGES OR MINOR CHANGES? THESE WILL REVEAL YOUR APTITUDE FOR COMPANY-WIDE CREATIVITY. IN SUMMARY, JEPKEMOI MUST REMOVE OR COACH HER CMO TO FOSTER PROACTIVENESS, RISK TAKING AND INNOVATION ORIENTATION IN ORDER TO REAP THE PROFITABLE REWARDS THAT GREATER INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY BRINGS TO AN ORGANISATION. HOW DOES YOUR COMPANY FALL WITHIN THE ABOVE MEASURES? SHARE YOUR IDEAS ON HOW TO FOSTER THE ANTECEDENTS OF INNOVATION IN YOUR FIRM WITH OTHER BUSINESS DAILY READERS THROUGH #INNOVATIONFORUM ON TWITTER.

92	FALL LEAF COLOR IN THE MOUNTAINS OF WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE THE BEST IT HAS BEEN IN A NUMBER OF YEARS BECAUSE OF GENERALLY DRIER-THAN-NORMAL CONDITIONS DURING 2015. THATS THE WORD FROM WESTERN CAROLINA UNIVERSITYS AUTUMNAL SEASON SAGE KATHY MATHEWS IN HER ANNUAL PREDICTION OF HOW FOLIAGE AROUND THE REGION WILL PERFORM AS THE SUNLIGHT OF SUMMER WANES AND DAYS BECOME FROSTY. MATHEWS, AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY AT WCU, SPECIALIZES IN PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND BASES HER COLOR FORECAST ON BOTH PAST AND PREDICTED WEATHER CONDITIONS. SHE BELIEVES THAT THE FORMATION OF HIGHER LEVELS OF PIGMENTS IN THE LEAVES CORRELATES WITH DRY WEATHER THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, BUT ESPECIALLY AS FALL COMES AROUND THE BEND. THIS FALL COULD BE ONE OF THE BEST LEAF COLOR SEASONS IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA IN RECENT MEMORY, MATHEWS SAID. THREE WORDS EXPLAIN IT UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER. U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE REGION HAD BEEN DRIER THAN NORMAL FOR MOST OF THE YEAR, BUT WITH ENOUGH RAIN, PARTICULARLY IN THE MONTHS OF APRIL AND JUNE, TO AVOID DROUGHT AND KEEP THE TREES HEALTHY, SHE SAID. SUGAR CONCENTRATIONS IN THE LEAVES INCREASE DURING DRY WEATHER BECAUSE THE TREES ARE NOT TAKING UP AS MUCH WATER THROUGH THEIR ROOTS, MATHEWS SAID. THE ABUNDANCE OF SUGARS LEADS TO THE PRODUCTION OF MORE ANTHOCYANINS, THE RED PIGMENTS THAT APPEAR WHEN GREEN CHLOROPHYLLS BEGIN RECEDING. THATS WHAT CAUSES THE LEAF COLORS TO REALLY POP, ALONG WITH THE SIMULTANEOUS APPEARANCE OF ORANGE AND YELLOW PIGMENTS ON THE SAME OR DIFFERENT TREE SPECIES, SHE SAID. SOME FOLIAGE FANS MAY BE WONDERING IF THE MUCH-PUBLICIZED EL NINO WEATHER PATTERN MAY AFFECT THE FALL COLORS. METEOROLOGISTS ARE PREDICTING A LIGHT HURRICANE SEASON IN THE ATLANTIC THIS YEAR, PARTLY BECAUSE OF DRY AIR OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO AND CARIBBEAN CAUSED BY EL NINO, AND THAT REDUCES THE CHANCES OF HEAVY RAIN AND BIG WIND STORMS IN THE MOUNTAINS IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER GOOD NEWS FOR THE LEAF DISPLAY, MATHEWS SAID. LEAF-PEEPERS ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW WHEN THE PEAK COLOR WILL HAPPEN, BUT THE TIMING OF THE COLOR CHANGE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE DECREASING AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT THAT COMES WITH THE PASSING DAYS, PLUS THE ELEVATION OF A PARTICULAR LOCATION, SHE SAID. THE PEAK OF FALL COLOR OFTEN ARRIVES DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND WEEK OF OCTOBER IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS, ABOVE 4,000 FEET, AND DURING THE THIRD WEEK OF OCTOBER IN THE MID-ELEVATIONS, 2,500 TO 3,500 FEET, MATHEWS SAID. VISITORS CAN LOOK FOR LEAVES TO BE PEAKING IN COLOR INTENSITY A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FIRST REPORTED FROST IN ANY PARTICULAR AREA, SHE SAID. REGARDLESS OF ALL THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT LEAF COLOR, VISITORS TO WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA ALWAYS WILL FIND A PLEASING LEAF DISPLAY SOMEWHERE IN THE MOUNTAINS FROM SEPTEMBER INTO NOVEMBER, WITH A WIDE RANGE OF COLOR MADE POSSIBLE BY THE REGIONS ELEVATIONS RANGING FROM 1,500 FEET TO OVER 6,000 FEET AND THE MORE THAN 100 TREE SPECIES, MATHEWS SAID. KATHY MATHEWS
93	A STATE-OF-THE-ART JOBS WEBSITE WILL HELP MATCH JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS, THE TNAISTE AND MINISTER FOR SOCIAL PROTECTION, JOAN BURTON T.D., HAS SAID. THE TNAISTE TODAY (FRIDAY, 18 SEPTEMBER 2015) ANNOUNCED THAT THE CONTRACT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF THE NEW JOBSIRELAND.IE WEBSITE HAS BEEN AWARDED TO BDO IRELAND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AN IRISH TECH START-UP - THE HIRE LAB BASED IN CARRIGALINE, CO. CORK. THE CONTRACT WHICH IS VALUED AT SOME 4.5M WILL LEAD TO THE CREATION OF UP TO 25 HIGH SKILLED JOBS IN THE HIRE LAB AND WILL DELIVER A FREE, CUTTING-EDGE RECRUITMENT AND EMPLOYMENT WEBSITE FOR USE BY JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS THROUGHOUT IRELAND. THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE IN THE PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL ROOM AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK, IN THE PRESENCE OF UCC VICE PRESIDENT, CAROLINE FENNELL. THE EXISTING JOBSIRELAND.IE WEBSITE, FIRST DEVELOPED IN THE LATE 1990S, IS THE LARGEST SUCH WEBSITE IN USE IN IRELAND WITH ALMOST 100,000 JOBS ADVERTISED IN 2014. ITS REPLACEMENT WILL IMPROVE SERVICES FOR JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS, INCLUDING: ENABLING JOBSEEKERS TO SUBMIT CVS AND APPLY FOR JOBS ON-LINE. ENABLING BOTH EMPLOYERS AND JOBSEEKERS TO SEARCH FOR EACH OTHER USING COMPETENCIES AND SKILLSETS. OPERATING IN THE BACKGROUND TO AUTOMATICALLY MATCH CANDIDATE CVS TO JOB SPECIFICATIONS POSTED BY EMPLOYERS, AND NOTIFYING CANDIDATES AND THE EMPLOYER WHEN SUCH A MATCH IS FOUND. INTEGRATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTIONS INTREO SERVICE IN SUPPORT OF PROGRAMMES SUCH AS COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT AND TS. THE TNAISTE SAID: TODAY IS ABOUT UNLOCKING POTENTIAL - ABOUT TRANSFORMING JOBSIRELAND.IE INTO A CUTTING-EDGE SERVICE THAT WILL BENEFIT BOTH JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE AS WE SPEED UP PROGRESS IN TACKLING UNEMPLOYMENT. ITS ABOUT UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY PERSON ON THE LIVE REGISTER TO RETURN TO WORK AND BUILD A BETTER FINANCIAL FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES, AND THEIR FAMILIES, OVER TIME. THE GOVERNMENT IS DRIVING A JOBS-LED RECOVERY THAT IS NOW ADDING 1,300 JOBS A WEEK, AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN BY A THIRD SINCE ITS CRISIS PEAK. BUT WEVE MORE TO DO. AND BDO IRELAND AND THE HIRE LAB WILL HELP US DO THAT THROUGH THIS VERY IMPORTANT CONTRACT. COMMENTING ON THE PROJECT, DERRY GRAY FROM BDO IRELAND STATED HIS DELIGHT THAT THE INNOVATIVE APPROACH PROPOSED BY THE COLLABORATION OF BDO AND THE HIRE LAB, WAS SELECTED AS THE PREFERRED BIDDER. THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE OF BDO AND THE HIRE LAB, IS A COLLABORATION OF TWO INDIGENOUS IRISH BUSINESSES, WHO WILL PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH A 21ST CENTURY SOLUTION TO THEIR JOBS AND RECRUITMENT PLATFORM. BEING AWARDED THIS CONTRACT IS A POSITIVE ENDORSEMENT OF IRISH INNOVATION IN THIS EXCITING AREA. OUR TEAM LOOKS FORWARD TO DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISE TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH A SOLUTION THAT NOT ONLY SATISFIES BUT EXCEEDS ITS TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS NEEDS. MAURICE BUCKLEY, CEO OF THE HIRE LAB COMMENTED, "WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTION ON SUCH A STRATEGIC PROJECT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DEPLOYING OUR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENTS' JOBS MATCHING AND VACANCY SERVICE. SECURING A PROJECT LIKE THIS, ALLOWS US TO CREATE 25 HIGHLY SKILLED POSITIONS DOUBLING OUR WORKFORCE IN CORK OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS."

THE NEW SERVICE, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO GO LIVE BY THE END OF MARCH 2016, WILL UPGRADE THE EXISTING JOBSIRELAND.IE SERVICE AND WILL INTRODUCE ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY TO THE BENEFIT OF JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS. THE CURRENT JOBSIRELAND.IE SERVICE ENABLES JOBSEEKERS TO SEARCH FOR JOB OPPORTUNITIES BASED ON JOB TYPE, LOCATION AND SALARY. EMPLOYERS HOWEVER CANNOT SEARCH FOR SUITABLE JOBSEEKERS THEY HAVE TO RELY ON CANDIDATES FINDING AND APPLYING FOR THEIR JOB FROM AMONG THE MANY THOUSANDS HOSTED ON THE SYSTEM.  IT WILL ALSO OPERATE IN THE BACKGROUND TO AUTOMATICALLY MATCH CANDIDATE CVS TO JOB SPECIFICATIONS POSTED BY EMPLOYERS AND NOTIFY CANDIDATES AND THE EMPLOYER WHEN A MATCH IS FOUND. THE SYSTEM WILL ALSO ENABLE JOBSEEKERS TO SUBMIT CVS AND APPLY FOR JOBS ON-LINE AND WILL INTEGRATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTIONS INTREO SERVICE IN SUPPORT OF PROGRAMMES SUCH AS COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT, TS AND JOBBRIDGE, AND WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENTS CASE WORKERS TO TRACK AND SUPPORT JOBSEEKER EMPLOYMENT SEARCH ACTIVITY.

94	REVISE DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, LATELY IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS (LETS CALL THEM RAOUL AND CHRISTINE, FOR CONVENIENCES SAKE) THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND RECENTLY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP. IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT CLOSE TO TEN YEARS AND I CONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP.  1 MICRON WORKING ON SECOND-GEN 3D XPOINT NON-VOLATILE MEMORY MEANWHILE TSINGHUA UNIGROUP CONTINUES TO STRIVE TO ACQUIRE THE US CHIPMAKER. RAOUL, IVE KNOWN FOR ALMOST AS LONG, BUT WE LIVE IN THE SAME CITY AND HANG OUT OCCASIONALLY. THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES.  THE POSTER THEME MUST BE AUTOMOTIVE RELATED, AND ANY MIXED MEDIA SUITABLE FOR REPRODUCTION AS A POSTER IS ALLOWED, INCLUDING COMPUTER-GENERATED GRAPHICS. CHRISTINE AND I HAD A FALLING OUT SOME TIME AGO AND ONLY RECENTLY RECONNECTED. DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST.  IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL IN ONE OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER, THIS WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND RAOUL HAS SINCE CHANGED. ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?).  BUT I JUST CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.  FINALLY, LOOK INTO INNOVATION ORIENTATION ITSELF. PART OF ME WONDERS IF IM BEING TOO CLINGY ABOUT THIS? ITS THEIR LIVES AND I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO GET IT IN PRACTICE. ANOTHER PART WONDERS IF IM BEING UNFAIR TO RAOUL? MAYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR THEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE. IVE THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW IM NOT AS BOTHERED AS I WAS INITIALLY. UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH.  THEY ARE WELL FOCUSED ON HOW TO CLING TO POWER, FOR THEY KNOW THAT THAT IS THE ROUTE TO SOUTHERN RESOURCES. I STILL CANT FULLY COME TO TERMS WITH IT AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS BETTER THAN THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY I CANT JUST LIVE AND LET LIVE? WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO? SIGNED, OVERLY ANXIOUS FOR NO GOOD REASON

99	ICC CHAIRMAN N SRINIVASAN HAS MOVED THE SUPREME COURT AGAINST BOARD FIOR CRICKET CONTROL OF INDIA SECRETARY ANURAG THAKUR SEEKING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OF THAKUR. FOLLOWING SUPREME COURT'S ORDER REJECTING N SRINIVASAN'S PLEA SEEKING CLARIFICATION WHETHER HE COULD ATTEND THE GOVERNING BODY MEETING AS TAMIL NADU CRICKET ASSOCIATION (TNCA) PRESIDENT, THE ICC CHAIRMAN HAS MOVED THE COURT AGAINST ANURAG THAKUR SEEKING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OF THAKUR, ACCORDING TO REPORT PUBLISHED BY INDIAN EXPRESS . SRINIVASAN, WITH HIS PLEA, HAS CHARGED THE BOARD FOR CRICKET CONTROL IN INDIA (BCCI) SECRETARY OF PERJURY SAYING HE FILED 'FALSE AFFIDAVIT' WITH 'PLETHORA OF MISLEADING STATEMENTS', REFERRING TO THE APPLICATION EARLIER MOVED BY THE BCCI REGARDING CONFLICT OF INTEREST ISSUE. IN THE FRESH PLEA, SRINIVASAN HAS COUNTERED TWO STATEMENTS MADE BY THAKUR IN BCCI'S APPLICATION. ALSO READ: GANGULY GOOD, BUT MANOHAR BEST FOR BCCI CHIEF POST: ANURAG THAKUR SRINIVASAN MENTIONED THE STATEMENT IN WHICH BCCI CITED ALLEGED CONFLICT OF INTEREST, CLAIMING HE WAS A TRUSTEE IN THE INDIA CEMENTS SHAREHOLDERS TRUST THAT OWNED INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE FRANCHISE CHENNAI SUPER KINGS. "THE AVERMENTS IN THE FALSE (BCCI) APPLICATION CAN THEN ONLY BE PERSONAL TO ANURAG THAKUR, WHO HAS ABUSED THE PROCESS OF THIS COURT BY FILING HIS PERSONAL FALSE AFFIDAVIT IN THE GARB OF AN AFFIDAVIT ON BEHALF OF THE BCCI," SRINIVASAN SAID. SRINIVASAN RUBBISHED THAKUR'S CLAIMS WHICH SAID THE BOARD AMENDED CERTAIN RULES ONLY TO ACCOMMODATE THE TAMIL NADU CRICKET SUPREMO'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST. HE CALLED THE CLAIM AN 'EGREGIOUS LIE' AND SAID EVERY BOARD MEMBER, INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI , WHO WAS THE THEN PRESIDENT OF CRICKET ASSOCIATION OF GUJARAT, WAS PRESENT WHEN THE AMENDMENT WAS MADE. SRINIVASAN HAS ALSO ACCUSED THAKUR OF SENSATIONALISING BCCI'S POSITION IN HIS PLEA AS HE "SOUGHT TO CREATE A CONFUSION BETWEEN HIM AND HIS NAMESAKE, ANOTHER N SRINIVASAN, WHO IS A FORMER PARTNER OF A CHARTERED ACCOUNTANCY FIRM IN CHENNAI," THE REPORT SAYS. SRINIVASAN HASN'T REFUSED TO HOLD BACK AND HAS EXPOSED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE BCCI AHEAD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ON OCTOBER 4. THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE TOP MEMBERS OF THE BOARD SEEMS NEVER ENDING.
100	THE 34-YEAR-OLD QUEENSLANDER BOWED OUT ON SUNDAY AFTER A 10-YEAR CAREER OF 59 TESTS PHOTO: AFP MELBOURNE: THE RETIREMENT OF ALL-ROUNDER SHANE WATSON ROBS TEST CRICKET OF ONE OF ITS MOST ENIGMATIC CHARACTERS, WHILE DEPRIVING AUSTRALIAN FANS OF THEIR FAVOURITE WHIPPING BOY IN THE RED-BALL GAME. THE 34-YEAR-OLD QUEENSLANDER BOWED OUT ON SUNDAY AFTER A 10-YEAR CAREER OF 59 TESTS, FEATURING 3,731 RUNS AT AN AVERAGE OF 35.19 AND 75 WICKETS AT 33.68. READ:AUSTRALIAS SHANE WATSON ANNOUNCES TEST RETIREMENT WATSON, WHO HAS NOT STEPPED DOWN FROM THE ONE-DAY AND TWENTY20 SIDES, CAN FURTHER BURNISH HIS CONSIDERABLE ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE SHORTER FORMATS OF THE GAME. BUT HIS RESPECTABLE, IF NOT SPECTACULAR, LEGACY IN TESTS WILL REMAIN A SOURCE OF DEBATE IN ASSESSING ONE OF THE GAMES MOST POLARISING PLAYERS. WATSONS BACKERS WILL REMEMBER A STOIC FIGURE WHO EKED A LOT FROM A CURSED BODY, FLASHED A GLORIOUS COVER DRIVE AND TOOK BAGS OF WICKETS ON FOREIGN PITCHES WITH METRONOMIC MEDIUM PACE. FANS CLOSER TO HOME WILL RECALL A CAREER THAT FELL INFURIATINGLY SHORT OF ITS ENORMOUS PROMISE. THERES A LOT THAT IM PROUD OF, WATSON SAID AFTER ANNOUNCING HIS DECISION. THE THING IM MOST PROUD OF IS IVE GIVEN EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN TO GET THE BEST OUT OF MYSELF. I HAVENT ACHIEVED CERTAINLY ALL THE THINGS I DREAMED OF ACHIEVING IN TEST CRICKET AVERAGE 50 WITH THE BAT AND IN THE 20S WITH THE BALL. THATS OBVIOUSLY THE DREAM AS AN ALL-ROUNDER TO ACHIEVE AND OBVIOUSLY I DIDNT GET ANYWHERE NEAR THAT, BUT I DO KNOW I GAVE IT EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BEST OUT OF MYSELF. BY ANY MEASURE, WATSON HAS BEEN A MAN OF CONTRADICTIONS, MANY OF THEM FRUSTRATING AND SOME QUITE HILARIOUS. SPORTING THE BARREL-CHESTED PHYSIQUE OF A SURF LIFE-SAVER, WATSON MADE HIS TEST DEBUT AGAINST PAKISTAN IN 2005, HAVING CUT HIS TEETH IN FIRST-CLASS CRICKET IN FRIGID TASMANIA, FAR FROM THE SUNNY BEACHES OF HIS NATIVE QUEENSLAND. HE FELL FLAT ON HIS FACE AFTER HIS OPENING DELIVERY AT THE SYDNEY CRICKET GROUND, BUT PICKED HIMSELF UP TO TAKE A WICKET AND SCORE A NERVOUS 31. HE WOULD PLAY ONLY TWO MORE TESTS BEFORE HIS SHOULDER GAVE WAY, SHUNTING HIM OUT OF THE SIDE FOR ANOTHER THREE YEARS. UPON HIS RETURN, HE QUICKLY ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS ONE OF THE COUNTRYS MOST IMPORTANT PLAYERS IN A TEAM BATTLING TO REBUILD AFTER THE RETIREMENTS OF A GOLDEN GENERATION OF PLAYERS. FALSE STARTS WHILE HIS BOWLING WAS COMMENDABLY TIGHT AND OFTEN PRODUCED BREAKTHROUGH WICKETS, HIS FOCUS AT THE CREASE WAS INCLINED TO WANDER. HE BECAME KNOWN AS A SQUANDERER OF STARTS, A REPUTATION THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY PROVE UNSHAKEABLE. IT WASNT UNTIL HIS 15TH TEST THAT HE WOULD FINALLY RAISE HIS BAT FOR A CENTURY, HAVING BEEN DROPPED ON 98 BY A PAKISTAN FIELDER IN THE 2009 BOXING DAY TEST IN MELBOURNE. HE WOULD SCORE ONLY THREE MORE TONS FROM HIS 109 INNINGS, THOUGH BUILDING PLATFORMS WITH 24 HALF-CENTURIES. ALTHOUGH A SHARP SLIP FIELDER, HIS RUNNING BETWEEN WICKETS WAS OFTEN LAMENTABLE, LEAVING BATTING PARTNERS FUMING AS THEY TRUDGED OFF AS CASUALTIES OF A WATSON-INDUCED MIX-UP. LATER IN HIS CAREER, HIS PADS SEEMED TO GROW TO EPIC PROPORTIONS AND OFFER THE EASIEST OF TARGET PRACTICE FOR ACCOMPLISHED SEAMERS SEEKING TO TRAP HIM LBW. WATSONS ENTHUSIASM FOR THE DECISION REVIEW SYSTEM WAS MATCHED ONLY BY HIS INEPTITUDE IN USING IT, AND YOUTUBE COMPILATIONS OF SOME OF HIS MOST FARCICAL APPEALS REMAIN IN HIGH CIRCULATION. THE INJURIES NEVER ABATED FOR LONG ENOUGH FOR WATSON TO BUILD MOMENTUM, AND HE GRADUALLY BECAME A PROBLEM. URGED TO SHELVE HIS BOWLING TO PRESERVE HIS BODY, HE FELL SHORT OF THE RUNS TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF AS A SPECIALIST BATSMAN. YET, HIS SEEMINGLY UNBREAKABLE HOLD OF HIS PLACE WITHIN THE TEAM WAS ONE OF THE BIGGER CURIOSITIES OF AUSTRALIAN CRICKET. CRITICS RAGED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND TALK-BACK RADIO IN HIS HOMELAND, BUT SELECTORS STUCK BY THEIR MAN THROUGH THICK AND THIN HOWEVER RARELY THEIR FAITH WAS REPAID. THE AXE FINALLY SWUNG IN JULY AFTER THE FIRST ASHES TEST IN ENGLAND WHERE THE SCORECARD SHOWED A FAMILIAR SIGHT FOR GROANING AUSTRALIANS WATSON TRAPPED LBW IN BOTH INNINGS AFTER MAKING STARTS. HE CUT A FORLORN FIGURE CARRYING THE DRINKS IN THE FINAL FOUR TESTS, WHICH SOMEHOW FELT POORER FOR THE LACK OF THE QUEENSLANDER. IF FAILING TO BRING RUNS OR WICKETS, WATSON COULD GENERALLY BE RELIED UPON TO DELIVER DRAMA OR COMEDY, AND HIS ABSENCE ROBS THE TEST ARENA OF ONE OF ITS MOST HUMAN ACTORS.

102	NORFOLK CONSTABULARYS SAFER SCHOOLS PARTNERSHIP IS ROLLING OUT THE ANTI-VIOLENCE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM TO YEAR 9 STUDENTS IN ALMOST 50 SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTY BETWEEN NOW AND MARCH NEXT YEAR. THE PROGRAM, WHICH IS AIMED AT PUPILS AGED 13 AND 14, WAS STARTED AND IS PRESENTED BY ANN BARTLETT, THE MOTHER OF A SERVICEMAN WHO DIED AFTER A FIGHT IN A PORTSMOUTH PUB WHEN HE WAS KILLED BY ONE PUNCH. SHE SAID: ONE PUNCH CAN KILL WAS SET UP IN THE UK AFTER THE LOSS OF ONE OF MY OWN. 21 YEAR-OLD KYLE WAS INVOLVED IN A FIGHT WHILST ON A NIGHT OUT WITH FRIENDS. HE SUFFERED SEVERE HEAD INJURIES AND DIED LESS THAN 24 HOURS LATER. EVERY MONTH WE DISCOVER THAT THIS IS HAPPENING MORE AND MORE AND BY RAISING AWARENESS AND EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE EARLIER, WE MAY HELP TO LESSEN THESE TRAGIC SENSELESS DEATHS. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENTATION WILL BE TO ALERT YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE DANGERS OF FIGHTING AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES, THEREBY REDUCING VIOLENT CRIME IN SCHOOLS OR INVOLVING YOUNG PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL. INSPECTOR BEX BROWN, FROM THE SAFER SCHOOLS AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT TEAM, SAID: I AM THRILLED THAT THIS PRESENTATION HAS BEEN POSITIVELY TAKEN UP BY THE SCHOOLS IN NORFOLK. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF GETTING INTO FIGHTS. THE AIM OF THE PRESENTATION IS TO TRY AND PREVENT TRAGIC ACCIDENTS FROM HAPPENING IN THE PLAYGROUND AND TO SHOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF USING VIOLENCE RATHER THAN SPEAKING TO A RESPONSIBLE ADULT OR TEACHER TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. WE WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO RESPECT ONE ANOTHER AND IF A PROBLEM DOES ARISE, FOR THEM TO FEEL CONFIDENT TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND WALK AWAY. IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR DAVID WILLIAMS, 27, OF CROSSWAY TERRACE, ACLE, WAS JAILED FOR 27 MONTHS FOLLOWING A ONE PUNCH ATTACK IN NORWICH WHICH LEFT THE VICTIM HAVING TO BE PUT INTO AN INDUCED COMA BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE HEAD INJURIES HE RECEIVED. JACK CHEUNG HAD BEEN ENJOYING A NIGHT OUT IN THE CITY WITH FRIENDS AND WAS IN UPPER KING STREET, OUTSIDE ALL BAR ONE, WHEN HE WAS PUNCHED IN THE FACE IN AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK. MR CHEUNG SUFFERED A SERIOUS HEAD INJURY AFTER FALLING TO THE GROUND AND HITTING HIS HEAD ON THE PAVEMENT FOLLOWING THE ATTACK WHICH HAPPENED ON JULY 20 LAST YEAR. HE WAS TREATED BY PARAMEDICS AT THE SCENE AND WAS TAKEN TO THE NORFOLK AND NORWICH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL BEFORE BEING TRANSFERRED TO ADDENBROOKES HOSPITAL IN CAMBRIDGE, WHERE HE WAS PUT IN AN INDUCED COMA TO ALLOW HIS INJURIES TO BE TREATED. WILLIAMS WAS JAILED AFTER ADMITTING INFLICTING GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM. DO YOU HAVE A CRIME STORY? EMAIL PETER.WALSH @ARCHANT.CO.UK
103	ABOUT 100 BUSINESSES FACING RELOCATION IF A FUTURE PARAMOUNT ENTERTAINMENT RESORT GOES AHEAD SAY THEY HAVE BARELY BEEN CONTACTED BY ITS DEVELOPERS AND FEAR HEAVY JOB LOSSES. PENINSULA MANAGEMENT GROUP (PMG) HAS BEEN SET UP BY COMPANIES IN NORTH KENT AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED THEME PARK, MANY OF WHICH SAY THERE ARE NO SUITABLE INDUSTRIAL SITES WHICH CAN ACCOMMODATE THEM NEARBY. THE BODY, FOUNDED IN MAY, IS CARRYING OUT AN EMPLOYMENT SURVEY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE RESORT ON THE SWANSCOMBE PENINSULA BETWEEN GRAVESEND AND DARTFORD. IT ESTIMATES ABOUT 5,000 JOBS WILL BE AFFECTED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF THE ATTRACTION GOES AHEAD. LOSSES ON THAT SCALE COULD MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE 27,000 JOBS THE PARK SAYS IT WILL CREATE IN THE FUTURE. MANY COMPANIES FEAR THEY WILL BE FORCED TO MOVE QUICKLY IF THE SO-CALLED LONDON PARAMOUNT IS APPROVED BECAUSE ITS DEVELOPERS, LONDON RESORT COMPANY HOLDINGS, WILL BE ABLE TO USE COMPULSORY PURCHASE POWERS HANDED DOWN FROM THE GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THE ATTRACTIONS BOSSES SAYS THEY HAVE MET REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GROUP AND HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE FREEHOLDERS AND LONG LEASEHOLDERS ON THE ESTATES. THE COMPANIES AFFECTED LIE ON MANOR WAY BUSINESS PARK IN SWANSCOMBE, THE NORTHFLEET INDUSTRIAL ESTATE AND THE KENT KRAFT ESTATE IN NORTHFLEET. PMG DIRECTOR DOUG HILTON SAID: IT IS UNLIKELY ANY SUITABLEEMPTY INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES OR SITES ARE AVAILABLEIN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITYTO ACCOMMODATE THIS NUMBER OF BUSINESSES UNLESS THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES START TO MAKE AN URGENT ALLOCATION WITHIN THEIR PLANS. "THIS WILL MEAN ANY APPLICATION FOR RELOCATION PREMISES WILL HAVE TO BE FAST-TRACKED AND NEW UNITS BUILT,MANY OF WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE CUSTOMISEDTO SUIT SPECIFIC NEEDS, BEFORE THE LEISURE PARK DEVELOPMENT CAN COMMENCE. PMGSMOST PRESSING CONCERNIS THE SECURITY AND CONTINUITY OF THE BUSINESSES, MOST OF WHICH ARE LONG STANDING, FAMILY-RUN ENTITIES, WHICH HAVE ALREADY HAD TO ENDURE SIMILAR TURMOIL WHEN UNION RAILWAYS RIPPED THE HEART OUT OF THESE ESTATES FOR THE HS1 LINE. "THE LOCAL AND WIDER COMMUNITIES, FROM WHICH MANY OF THE EMPLOYEES AND OWNERS MATERIALISE, WILL LOSE A HUGE RANGE OF SKILLS AND JOBS IF THESE BUSINESSES ARE DESTROYED OR FORCED TO RELOCATE OUT OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA. IF IT DESTROYS ALL THESE JOBS BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS THEN THE THEME PARK WILL SIMPLY NOT BE CREATING ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IT HAS SO FAR CLAIMED. LONDON RESORT COMPANY HOLDINGS DIRECTOR FENLON DUNPHY, ON BEHALF OF LONDON PARAMOUNT, SAID: WHILE THERE IS A LACK OF SUITABLE SUPPLY OF BUSINESS PREMISES IN THE IMMEDIATE LOCALITY, OUR AGENTS ARE UNDERTAKING A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH FOR PREMISES WITHIN GRAVESHAM, DARTFORD AND THE WIDER REGION TOWARDS MEDWAY AND MAIDSTONE. WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THIS PROCESS RUNS AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO ENSURE BUSINESSES CAN BE GIVEN THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR RELOCATION AND THEREFORE JOBS ARE TRANSFERRED RATHER THAN LOST. WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE JOB LOSSES, LONDON PARAMOUNT WILL BE A LONG-TERM PROVIDER OF UP TO 27,000 JOBS IN LOCAL BOROUGHS AS WELL AS IN THE WIDER COUNTY AND SOUTH EAST.
104	REVISE: TRANSPORTING MILLION TONNES OF SULPHUR IN THE PAST YEAR DURING OUR TESTING AND COMMISSIONING AND TRIAL OPERATIONS PHASES IS A VERY PROUD ACHIEVEMENT FOR ETIHAD RAIL, OUR OPERATING PARTNER, ERDB, AND THE UAE AS A WHOLE, AS IT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES OUR UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION AS A RELIABLE, SAFE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MODE OF TRANSPORT, REMARKED ITS CEO FARIS SAIF AL MAZROUEI. OUR SUCCESS TO DATE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE TREMENDOUS OUR CUSTOMER AND PARTNER, ADNOC, HE STATED. TODAYS ANNOUNCEMENT OFFERS AN INSIGHT INTO THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THAT THE FEDERAL RAILWAY NETWORK WILL BRING TO THE UAE, WITH ETIHAD RAILS TRAINS HAVING ALREADY REPLACED MORE THAN 66,000 TRUCK TRIPS FROM THE ROADS IN HE WESTERN REGION OF ABU DHABI IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, SAID THE COMPANY IN ITS STATEMENT. THE ETIHAD RAIL PROJECT IS BEING DELIVERED IN THREE KEY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. IT WILL BE USED TO TRANSPORT BULK AND NON-BULK MATERIALS, OFFERING TAILOR-MADE SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERING CUSTOMER NEEDS. NETWORK ROUTES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE ALL KEY CUSTOMER SECTORS, WITH FREIGHT FACILITIES POSITIONED TO CONNECT PRODUCTION HUBS WITH POINTS OF IMPORT AND EXPORT, SAID THE STATEMENT. ETIHAD RAIL SAID ITS FLEET COMPRISES SEVEN LOCOMOTIVE AND 270 HOPPER WAGONS AND OPERATES TO TRANSPORT GRANULATED SULPHUR FROM TWO PLANTS IN SHAH AND HABSHAN IN THE WESTERN REGION OF ABU DHABI TO ITS TERMINAL AT RUWAIS PORT. ONCE COMPLETED, THE ETIHAD RAIL NETWORK WILL SPAN APPROXIMATELY 1,200 KM ACROSS THE UAE, CONNECTING URBAN AND PERIPHERAL COMMUNITIES, FACILITATING TRADE, OPENING UP COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND FOSTERING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, STATED AL MAZROUEI. IT WILL ALSO FORM A VITAL PART OF THE GCC RAILWAY NETWORK, LINKING THE UAE TO SAUDI ARABIA THROUGH GHWEIFAT IN THE WEST AND OMAN THROUGH AL AIN IN THE EAST, NOTED THE OFFICIAL. GOING FORWARD, WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THIS SUCCESS AS WE MOVE TOWARDS OUR TARGET OF TRANSPORTING MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION TONNES OF SULPHUR EVERY YEAR ONCE WE ENTER INTO FULL COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, HE ADDED. SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THE 261-KM-ROUTE LAST YEAR, TRIALS ARE BEING HELD ON A DAILY BASIS, CONDUCTED BY ETIHAD RAILS OPERATING PARTNER, ERDB. FULL COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO START SHORTLY ONCE ETIHAD RAIL IS GRANTED ITS REGULATORY APPROVALS, THUS LEADING TO A SIGNIFICANT JUMP IN THE VOLUME OF SULPHUR TRANSPORTED BY RAIL IN 2018 AND BEYOND, SAID A SENIOR OFFICIAL.
105	ROBEY JENKINS, HR MANAGER FOR AGE UK GLOUCESTERSHIRE SHARES HIS WEEKLY BLOG WITH US: MUCH LIKE THE NAMING OF CATS, THE ADVERTISING OF A JOB IS A CURIOUS MATTER. LAST WEEK I MADE AN ARGUMENT THAT JOB ADVERTISERS SHOULD TAKE A MORE PRACTICAL APPROACH TO THE PAPER QUALIFICATIONS THEY EXPECT FROM CANDIDATES. AND IT OCCURRED TO ME AS I WROTE THAT, PERHAPS, I SHOULD TAKE SOME TIME TO WRITE MORE GENERALLY ABOUT THE ADVERTISING OF JOBS. IT IS A TASK OFTEN DELEGATED TO JUNIOR HR OPERATORS, RECRUITING MANAGERS OR SOMEONE IN THE RECRUITING MANAGERS TEAM. IT OFTEN INVOLVES DIGGING OUT WHATEVER COPY WAS USED LAST TIME TO ADVERTISE THE ROLE AND RECYCLING IT. SO LET ME START BY SAYING THAT IF YOU, THE HR LEAD IN YOUR ORGANIZATION, ARENT PERSONALLY REVIEWING THE COPY OF EVERY SINGLE JOB AD YOU RELEASE, THEN EITHER YOU ALREADY HAVE A SPECIALIST RECRUITMENT LEAD (IN WHICH CASE, GO WRITE YOUR OWN BLOG AND STOP LOOKING TO ME FOR ADVICE) OR YOURE DOING IT WRONG. JOB ADVERTS SHOULD BE TREATED AS TOPICS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE BY THE HR LEAD, EVEN IF THEY ARE DELEGATING THE SPECIFICS TO A TRAINED SUBORDINATE, FOR TWO KEY REASONS: THE QUALITY OF YOUR JOB ADS WILL DICTATE THE QUALITY OF YOUR APPLICANTS . A REALLY POWERFUL AND EFFECTIVE JOB AD CONVEYS A POSITIVE IMPRESSION OF THE ROLE AND THE ORGANIZATION AND SO WILL DRAW MORE APPLICANTS. AS THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS INCREASES, THE OVERALL QUALITY OF YOUR SHORT-LIST WILL RISE. YOUR JOB ADS ARE ALSO AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR YOUR WHOLE ORGANIZATION . IT ISNT OFTEN THAT HR GETS TO WRITE ADVERTISING COPY WITHOUT MARKETING GETTING INVOLVED. IN FACT, IF YOU HAVE A MARKETING & COMMUNICATIONS TEAM, THEN THEY PROBABLY SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN HELPING TO FRAME YOUR JOB AD. BUT WHETHER THEY ARE INVOLVED OR NOT, A JOB AD IS A MARKETING TOOL AND A PRESS RELEASE. AND ITS NOT JUST ONE AIMED AT PEOPLE OUTSIDE YOUR ORGANIZATION. YES, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, YOUR JOB ADS WILL BE READ BY PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WORK FOR YOU. IT WILL BE READ WITH PARTICULAR INTEREST BY THOSE ALREADY DOING THE SAME OR A SIMILAR JOB TO THE ONE YOURE ADVERTISING FOR AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE THINKING OF APPLYING! THEY WANT TO SEE WHETHER WHAT YOURE ADVERTISING AND WHAT THEY DO EVERY DAY BEAR ANY RESEMBLANCE TO EACH OTHER. SO WITH THOSE TWO KEY POINTS MADE, LETS TAKE A PRACTICAL LOOK AT WHAT TO INCLUDE IN A JOB ADVERT AND HOW TO LAY IT OUT. IT WOULD BE TEMPTING, AT THIS POINT, TO START WITH THE BOX TICKING: WHAT YOU MUST INCLUDE AND WHAT YOU MUST NOT. BUT IM GOING TO DELIBERATELY LEAVE THAT TO THE END. IF I COULD, ID LEAVE IT OUT ENTIRELY, BUT I FEEL COMPELLED TO MENTION IT, IF ONLY TO SALVE MY CONSCIENCE. INSTEAD, WE WILL START WITH WHATS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT: SELL THE COMPANY A JOB AD IS AN ADVERT, WHICH MEANS IT IS AN EXERCISE IN SELLING. AND THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD BE SELLING IS THE ORGANIZATION. THIS SETS THE CONTEXT FOR THE JOB. A JOB HITTING STUFF OR MOVING PAPER OR WRITING CODE ISNT, INHERENTLY, ALL THAT EXCITING. BUT ITS A COG IN A MACHINE THAT DOES SOMETHING GREAT! AT LEAST, IT OUGHT TO BE, ESPECIALLY IF YOURE IN A CHARITY. THE ORGANIZATION DOES SOMETHING BIG AND EXCITING AND CLEVER AND IMPORTANT AND YOU, THE APPLICANT, ARE GOING TO HAVE A PART IN THAT! THE AD SHOULD MAKE THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATE FEEL EXCITED ABOUT WORKING FOR YOU BEFORE THEYVE EVEN READ THE JOB DESCRIPTION. SELL THE JOB TOO MANY JOB ADS FOCUS ON WHAT THE JOB INVOLVES. AND UNLESS THE JOB IN QUESTION INVOLVES (A) CUDDLING BABY ANIMALS, (B) SPACE TRAVEL OR (C) FREE LUXURY HOLIDAYS, THE ACTUAL DAY-TO-DAY WORK THAT THE JOB INVOLVES ISNT GOING TO ATTRACT ANYONE. IF YOU WANT TO SELL THE JOB, SELL ITS IMPACT . YOUVE ALREADY EXPLAINED WHY WHAT THE COMPANY DOES IS AMAZING, IMPORTANT AND EXCEPTIONAL. SO NOW YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY WHAT THIS JOB DOES IS VITAL TO THE AMAZING IMPORTANCE OF THAT EXCEPTIONALITY. CANDIDATES WILL PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW WHETHER THE JOB INVOLVES HITTING THINGS OR MOVING PAPER OR WRITING CODE. WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW IS THAT DOING THESE THINGS MATTERS AND THAT THEIR WORK WILL HAVE AN IMPACT AND ESPECIALLY (BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY) IN A CHARITABLE CONTEXT HOW THEM DOING THIS JOB WILL MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. INCIDENTALLY, IF YOU CANT DRAW A CLEAR LINE BETWEEN WHAT THE COMPANY DOES AND HOW THIS JOB CONTRIBUTES TO WHAT THIS COMPANY DOES THEN STOP WRITING THIS JOB AD AND GO BACK TO FIND OUT WHETHER YOU NEED THE JOB AT ALL. BUY THE CANDIDATE THERE ARE SOME THINGS, AS I SUGGESTED AT THE START, THAT YOU MUST INCLUDE. THE JOB TITLE, THE SALARY, THE HOURS AND THE LOCATION ARE THE KEY FOUR THINGS YOU NEED TO INCLUDE. IF SPACE ALLOWS, FEEL FREE TO INCLUDE A ROUGH OUTLINE OF THE OTHER BENEFITS, BUT DO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ACTUAL BENEFITS AND NOT JUST A LEGAL RIGHTS DRESSED IN SHINY CLOTHES. FLEXIBLE WORKING, PAID PARENTAL LEAVE AND A PENSION ARE ALL, TO SOME EXTENT, RIGHTS. IF YOU ENHANCE THESE, THOUGH, SAY SO. ALSO, UP TO THIS POINT, YOUVE BEEN IN SELL MODE. THE READER IS NOW POISED TO MOVE FROM CURIOUS TO CANDIDATE. BUT YOU CANT JUST LET ANYONE THROUGH THE DOOR. THEY WANT THE JOB. THEY NEED THE JOB. BUT DO THEY HAVE WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM THE JOB? OF COURSE, YOULL BE SHORT-LISTING AND INTERVIEWING TO PICK THE PERFECT CANDIDATE. BUT YOU CAN MAKE THEM DO PART OF THE WORK FOR YOU BY SETTING OUT A FEW FILTER REQUIREMENTS IN THE ADVERT. THESE ARE THE HEADLINE BASICS THAT A CANDIDATE MUST HAVE TO GET FOOT IN THE DOOR. THINK IN TERMS OF ABSOLUTES: STRAIGHTFORWARD YES OR NO CRITERIA THAT FALL INTO ONE OF THREE CATEGORIES: QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERIENCE AND RESOURCES (FOR EXAMPLE, NEEDING A DRIVERS LICENCE OR ACCESS TO A CAR FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES). THESE SHOULD FILTER OUT ANYONE WHO CANT SAY YES TO EVERYTHING, SO EVERYONE WHO MOVES ON TO THE APPLY NOW STAGE SHOULD ALREADY MEET YOUR BASIC NEEDS. AS FOR THINGS YOU SHOULD NOT INCLUDE, KEEP IN MIND THE PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS IN THE EQUALITIES ACT 2010. ANYTHING IN THE AD STRAYING INTO THAT TERRITORY WITHOUT A VERY CLEAR, OPERATIONAL JUSTIFICATION: REMOVE. THE NAMING OF CATS NOT ONLY IS THE NAMING OF CATS A CURIOUS MATTER, ACCORDING TO OLD POSSUM, BUT IT ALSO INVOLVES THREE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT PARTS. AND SO, WE SEE, DOES THE ADVERTISING OF JOBS, ALTHOUGH IT DOESNT SCAN SO WELL. THE GOOD NEWS, THOUGH, IS THAT NO PART OF THE ADVERTISING OF JOBS IS EFFANINEFFABLE OR DEEP AND INSCRUTABLE. JOBS ARE PRODUCTS. CANDIDATES ARE CURRENCY. IF WE WANT THE RIGHT CANDIDATES IN THE RIGHT JOBS, THEN WE HAVE TO SELL THE COMPANY, SELL THE JOB, AND BUY THE CANDIDATE.

106	REVISION: EACH DAY WE SEE THE EFFORT OF UNIONS TO FORCE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY FARM WORKERS TO PAY BRIBES TO WORK. THEN YOU HAVE THE EFFORT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES ARE FORCING WORKERS TO SPEND MORE ON WORKING CONDITIONS. THEN YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR FARMS, ESPECIALLY IF A NEW PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. THE SOLUTION IS ROBOTS AND MACHINES TO DO THE PICKING AND HARVESTING OF CROPS.  CRUZ "WILL RARELY BE IN TEXAS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE," FLEMING WARNED SUPPORTERS IN AN INVITATION TO THE TYLER EVENT. WHILE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE NEW MACHINES, THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SO. YEARS AGO UC DAVIS DEVELOPED A TOMATO PICKING MACHINEBUT THE UNIONS STOPPED ITS DEVELOPMENT. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. AGAIN, AMERICA CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN AGRICULTURE INTERNATIONALLY. WE CAN INNOVATE AND FEED THE HUNGRY MASSES BY MAKING FOOD AVAILABILITY MORE RELIABLE AND LOW COST. 4 LABOR-INTENSIVE CROPS FARMERS WISH THEY HAD ROBOTS TO HARVEST ELIZA BARCLAY, KPBS, 9/7/15 THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION SAYS MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO PICK HOT AND BELL PEPPERS COULD HELP SOLVE LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEMS. IF YOURE ENJOYING A LATE-SUMMER FRUIT PIE THIS LABOR DAY, CONSIDER WHAT WENT INTO GROWING AND HARVESTING THAT FRUIT. CHANCES ARE, IT TOOK A LOT OF HUMAN HANDS TO ENSURE ITS SKIN WOULD BE PERFECT AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. WHILE MACHINES HAVE REPLACED HUMAN HANDS FOR A LOT OF FARM JOBS THE HARVESTING OF TOMATOES FOR PROCESSING, THE CUTTING OF LETTUCE AND SPINACH, THE SHAKING OF ALMOND TREES TO MAKE THE NUTS FALL TO THE GROUND MANY FRUIT, VEGETABLE AND NUT FARMERS STILL RELY HEAVILY ON PEOPLE TO PLANT, MAINTAIN AND HARVEST THEIR CROPS. MACHINES DONT YET EXIST FOR THESE CROPS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN AMPLE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK, AND BECAUSE ITS HARD TO DESIGN MACHINES THAT CAN CUT OR PICK THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLES WITHOUT SQUISHING OR DAMAGING THEM TOO MUCH. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. ALL THATS CREATED A NEW PUSH FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO MECHANIZATION TO REPLACE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME FILLING. THERES AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF FRESH-MARKET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS, MATTHEW WHITING , AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND EXTENSION SPECIALIST AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEET CHERRY INDUSTRY, TELLS THE SALT. THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED HARVEST LABOR IS ON EVERY GROWERS MIND. FOR LABOR DAY, WE THOUGHT WED ROUND UP SOME OF THE CROPS THAT CANT YET BE HARVESTED BY A MACHINE, BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE FUTURE. TO BE CLEAR, THE ISSUE OF FARM LABOR IS COMPLICATED. AND MACHINES THAT COULD HARVEST THESE CROPS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE. SWEET CHERRIES THESE ARE THE SOFT, SWEET CHERRIES WE GET IN BAGS WITH THE STEM ATTACHED. AND WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND PLUMP? BECAUSE A HUMAN HAND CAREFULLY PICKED THEM. BUT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER WILLING HANDS TO DO THAT WORK. AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTICED. OF ALL THE PRODUCERS THAT DREAM OF MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO EASE THEIR LABOR WOES, THE SWEET CHERRY GROWERS MIGHT BE THE CLOSEST TO GETTING ONE THANKS TO RESEARCH FUNDING. MATT WHITING SAYS HE AND OTHERS AT WSU ARE CLOSE TO FINDING A COMMERCIAL PARTNER FOR A PROTOTYPE HARVESTER THAT CAN PICK 50 TIMES AS MANY CHERRIES AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD IN THE SAME TIME. STILL, THERES ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS NEW MODEL IS VIABLE: NEW VARIETIES OF CHERRIES SUITED TO THE MECHANICAL HARVESTER WILL NEED TO BE BRED. WHITING SAYS RESEARCH IS HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT IN 10 TO 12 YEARS, SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER GROWERS A SUITE OF NEW VARIETIES. ASPARAGUS AS THE HUFFINGTON POST HAS REPORTED , ASPARAGUS IS UNIQUELY LABOR INTENSIVE BECAUSE THE QUICK-GROWING PLANT MUST BE HARVESTED EVERY DAY OF ITS THREE-MONTH GROWING SEASON. EACH PLANT SPROUTS MULTIPLE SPEARS (THE PART OF THE PLANT WE EAT) A DAY, WHICH HAVE TO BE HAND-CUT EVERY DAY.  LET'S START AT THE TOP AND WORK OUR WAY DOWN. SO THAT MEANS WORKERS ARE CUTTING 14 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FROM ROUGHLY FEBRUARY TO MAY. BUT VARIOUS MECHANICAL ASPARAGUS HARVESTERS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING THEM. ACCORDING TO A 2009 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT , IF THE U.S. ASPARAGUS INDUSTRY IS TO INSURE A COMPETITIVE POSITION, IT MUST SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGY FOR LABOR TO LOWER PER UNIT COSTS AND SHIFT THE WORKFORCE TO VALUE-ADDED EMPLOYMENT. INSTITUTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW. APPLES COMMERCIAL APPLE PICKING TODAY REQUIRES BRAWN WORKERS HAVE TO FILL BUCKETS ALL DAY LONG WITH HEAVY APPLES AND THEN DUMP THEM INTO BINS. AND ACCORDING TO A FRUIT INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION , THE ERA OF FULLY AUTOMATED ROBOTIC HARVESTERS NAVIGATING [APPLE] ORCHARD ROWS IS STILL YEARS AWAY.  THATS CHANGING, THOUGH. THE WASHINGTON STATE TREE FRUIT RESEARCH COMMISSION IS NOW PURSUING MORE RESEARCH ON MECHANICAL HARVESTING. AND THIS YEAR, SOME COMMERCIAL APPLE FARMERS MAY BE USING A VACUUM HARVESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME. ITS DESIGNERS SAY IT SAVES TIME, REDUCES PICKER FATIGUE AND BOOST THE HARVEST YIELD. PEPPERS CALIFORNIA GROWS ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE PEPPERS IN THE U.S., AND LATELY THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION HAS BEEN TALKING MORE DEVELOPING MECHANICAL HARVESTING AND VARIETIES BRED TO BE PICKED BY MACHINES. ACCORDING TO A 2015 REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION, WITH INCREASING COST AND DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF LABOR NEEDED TO PICK PEPPERS, INNOVATION [SIMILAR TO THE PROCESSED TOMATO INDUSTRY] COULD GIVE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. FARMERS SIGNIFICANT RETURNS AND POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PEPPER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA, THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO HAVE FRESH MARKET QUALITY AND MECHANICAL HARVESTING IN BOTH BLOCKY [BELL PEPPERS] AND HOT TYPES.

107	(NANOWERK NEWS) RESEARCHERS AT CIC NANOGUNE (BASQUE COUNTRY) IN COLLABORATION WITH COLLEAGUES AT ICFO - THE INSTITUTE OF PHOTONIC SCIENCES (CATALUNYA) HAVE IMAGED HOW LIGHT MOVES INSIDE AN EXOTIC CLASS OF MATTER KNOWN AS HYPERBOLIC MATERIALS. THEY OBSERVED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, ULTRASLOW PULSE PROPAGATION AND BACKWARD PROPAGATING WAVES IN DEEP SUBWAVELENGTH-SCALE THICK SLABS OF BORON NITRIDE A NATURAL HYPERBOLIC MATERIAL FOR INFRARED LIGHT. THIS WORK HAS BEEN FUNDED BY THE EC GRAPHENE FLAGSHIP AND WAS RECENTLY REPORTED IN NATURE PHOTONICS (). HYPERBOLIC MATERIALS ARE VERY SPECIAL BECAUSE THEY BEHAVE LIKE A METAL IN ONE DIRECTION, BUT LIKE AN INSULATOR IN THE OTHER. UNTIL NOW, THESE MATERIALS HAVE BEEN USED TO FABRICATE COMPLEX NANOSTRUCTURES THAT PERMIT SUBWAVELENGTH-SCALE IMAGING, AS WELL AS THE FOCUSING AND CONTROLLING OF LIGHT AT THE NANOSCALE. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO FULLY EXPLOIT THEIR POTENTIAL, IT IS NECESSARY TO STUDY AND UNDERSTAND HOW LIGHT BEHAVES INSIDE THEM. THE WORK LAYS THE FOUNDATIONS FOR STUDYING THE PRECISE MANNER IN WHICH LIGHT TRAVELS THROUGH COMPLEX OPTICAL SYSTEMS AT THE SUBWAVELENGTH SCALE IN EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS OF DETAIL. SUCH A CAPABILITY WILL BE VITAL FOR VERIFYING THAT FUTURE NANOPHOTONIC DEVICES, PERHAPS WITH BIOSENSING OR OPTICAL COMPUTING APPLICATIONS, ARE FUNCTIONING AS EXPECTED. "THE DIFFICULTY IN PERFORMING THE REPORTED EXPERIMENTS IS THE EXTREMELY SHORT WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT WHEN IT IS INSIDE A HYPERBOLIC MATERIAL EXPLAINS IKERBASQUE PROFESSOR RAINER HILLENBRAND, LEADER OF THE NANOOPTICS GROUP AT NANOGUNE. WHEN LIGHT MOVES INSIDE THE MATERIAL IN OUR CASE MID-INFRARED LIGHT IN A 135 NM BORON NITRIDE SLAB - IT TRAVELS IN THE FORM OF WHAT WE CALL A POLARITON, WHERE THE LIGHT IS ACTUALLY COUPLED TO THE VIBRATIONS OF THE MATTER ITSELF". THESE POLARITONS CAN BE CONSIDERED A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD TO THE SCIENTISTS TRYING TO STUDY THEM. ON THE ONE HAND, THEY SQUEEZE LIGHT INTO MUCH SMALLER VOLUMES THAN IS NORMALLY POSSIBLE. THIS IS HELPFUL FOR A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE THE MANIPULATION OF LIGHT IN TINY SPACES, SUCH AS DETECTING AND IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUAL MOLECULES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS ULTRA-HIGH CONFINEMENT MEANS THAT SPECIAL TECHNIQUES HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED TO LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOR. EDWARD YOXALL, WHO PERFORMED THE EXPERIMENTS AT NANOGUNE ALONG WITH MARTIN SCHNELL, ELABORATES: "BECAUSE THE WAVELENGTH OF A POLARITON IS SO SMALL, WE CANNOT USE 'CONVENTIONAL' OPTICAL EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS LENSES AND CAMERAS, TO IMAGE IT. INSTEAD, WE HAVE TO USE A SPECIAL TYPE OF MICROSCOPE." THIS MICROSCOPE - A SCATTERING-TYPE SCANNING NEAR-FIELD INFRARED MICROSCOPE - IS CAPABLE OF SEEING DETAILS 1000 TIMES SMALLER THAN A STANDARD INFRARED MICROSCOPE, VISUALIZING "OBJECTS" OF JUST 10 NANOMETERS. "BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION THAT MAKES TRACKING POLARITONS TRICKY", CONTINUES YOXALL. "IF WE WANT TO SEE HOW A POLARITON MOVES, WE NEED TO DETECT AND TRACK IT IN BOTH SPACE AND TIME. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY USING EXTREMELY SHORT FLASHES OF LIGHT - OR PULSES- THAT ARE JUST 100 FEMTOSECONDS LONG." THAT IS AN EXTREMELY SMALL NUMBER; LESS THAN ONE MILLIONTH OF A MILLIONTH OF A SECOND. BY USING THESE VERY SHORT FLASHES IN COMBINATION WITH THEIR NEAR-FIELD MICROSCOPE, THE RESEARCHERS ARE ABLE TO WATCH THE POLARITONS PASSING DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ALONG THE BORON NITRIDE SLAB, ALLOWING FOR MEASURING THEIR SPEED. BY USING BOTH THE SPACE AND TIME INFORMATION THAT IS GATHERED DURING THE EXPERIMENT, THE SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXACTLY DETERMINE HOW THE POLARITON WAS TRAVELLING. THE TIME- AND SPACE-RESOLVED MAPS REVEALED A RANGE OF INTRIGUING BEHAVIORS OF THE POLARITONS, INCLUDING A DRAMATIC SLOWING DOWN OF THE PULSE VELOCITY - BELOW 1 PERCENT OF THE LIGHT VELOCITY IN VACUUM- AND A REVERSAL OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE POLARITON WAVES WERE PROPAGATING IN RELATION TO THE DIRECTION OF THE ENERGY FLOW. AN EXCITING RESULT IS THE SPEED AT WHICH THE POLARITON MOVES, SAYS YOXALL. THERES A LOT OF INTEREST IN SLOW LIGHT, AND WHAT WEVE SHOWN HERE IS A NOVEL WAY OF ACHIEVING THIS. SLOW LIGHT IN CONVENTIONAL PHOTONIC STRUCTURES HAS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR MANIFOLD APPLICATIONS IN SENSING AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, OWING TO ENHANCE LIGHT-MATTER INTERACTIONS. THE DEEP SUBWAVELENGTH-SCALE CONFINEMENT OF SLOW POLARITONS IN HYPERBOLIC MATERIALS COULD HELP TO MINIATURIZE THESE DEVICES.

112	SUMMARY OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO, KROGER HAS PROVIDED MUCH HIGHER RETURNS THAN EITHER WAL-MART OR TARGET. THIS OUTPERFORMANCE WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS COMING TOGETHER. INTERESTINGLY, THE SAME COMPONENTS THAT LED TO PAST OUTPERFORMANCE COULD PROVIDE A DRAG ON RETURNS MOVING FORWARD. IN A PREVIOUS ARTICLE , I DETAILED HOW KROGER (NYSE: KR ) PROVIDED VERY SOLID INVESTMENT RETURNS OVER THE PAST DECADE. IT CAME DOWN TO A FEW THINGS: REASONABLE GROWTH COUPLED WITH A SOLID REDUCTION IN SHARE COUNT AND AN EXPANSION IN THE EARNINGS MULTIPLE. THAT IS, KROGER, AS A COMPANY, SAW REASONABLE GROWTH, BUT INVESTORS RECEIVED AN OUTSIZED BENEFIT. REVIEWING THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION CAN BE HELPFUL FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST, IT PROVIDES YOU WITH A HISTORICAL VIEW OF THE INVESTMENT. YOU CAN SEE THE MAJOR COMPONENTS INTERACT TO GIVE YOU A BETTER FEEL FOR WHY SOMETHING OCCURRED. PERHAPS JUST AS IMPORTANT IS THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN GET A GAUGE AS TO REPEATABILITY. NATURALLY, HISTORY DOES NOT REPEAT ITSELF, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T LEARN SOMETHING. IF A SECURITY WAS "SUCCESSFUL" IN THE PAST DUE TO CERTAIN COMPONENTS, IT CAN BE TELLING TO REVIEW THOSE VALUE-DRIVING FACTORS. THESE TWO THINGS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY LOOKING AT A SINGLE SECURITY. IT CAN ALSO BE USEFUL TO COMPARE A SINGLE COMPANY TO SOME SIMILAR COMPETITORS: FOR INSTANCE WAL-MART (NYSE: WMT ) AND TARGET (NYSE: TGT ). OF COURSE, THERE ARE OTHER (AND PERHAPS MORE DIRECT) COMPETITORS OUT THERE FOR KROGER, BUT AS FAR AS LARGE-CAP DIVIDEND GROWTH COMPANIES GO, WAL-MART AND TARGET OFFER A SOLID BASELINE. HERE'S A SIDE-BY-SIDE (BY-SIDE) COMPARISON OF KROGER, WAL-MART AND TARGET DATING BACK TO FISCAL-YEAR 2005. NOTE THAT ALL NUMBERS ARE BASED ON FISCAL RATHER THAN CALENDAR YEARS: KR WMT TGT REVENUE GROWTH 6.7% 4.9% 3.6% START PROFIT MARGIN 1.6% 3.5% 4.6% END PROFIT MARGIN 1.6% 3.4% 3.8% EARNINGS GROWTH 7.0% 4.5% 1.4% YEARLY SHARE COUNT -4.3% -2.8% -3.4% EPS GROWTH 11.5% 7.6% 5.2% START P/E 14 18 20 END P/E 20 17 17 SHARE PRICE GROWTH 15.8% 7.0% 3.3% % OF DIVS COLLECTED 20% 25% 16% START PAYOUT % 17% 23% 14% END PAYOUT % 20% 38% 44% DIVIDEND GROWTH 13.2% 13.8% 19.6% TOTAL RETURNS 16.5% 8.6% 4.7% THIS TABLE PROVIDES ALL THE MAJOR CUES AS TO WHY KROGER PROVIDED INVESTORS WITH MUCH HIGHER RETURNS AS COMPARED TO SHAREHOLDERS IN WAL-MART OR TARGET. LET'S START AT THE TOP AND WORK OUR WAY DOWN. KROGER STARTED THE PERIOD WITH REVENUES OF ABOUT $60 BILLION AND GREW THIS NUMBER TO OVER $108 BILLION - THIS EQUATES TO REVENUE GROWTH OF ABOUT 6.7% PER YEAR. WAL-MART IS MUCH LARGER - HAVING STARTED WITH $315 BILLION IN REVENUES - BUT DIDN'T GROW AS FAST. AT THE END OF THE PERIOD, THE COMPANY GENERATED $485 BILLION IN REVENUES, GOOD FOR A GROWTH RATE OF ABOUT 4.9% PER YEAR. TARGET LAGS IN BOTH CATEGORIES. THE COMPANY STARTED THE PERIOD WITH ABOUT $53 BILLION IN REVENUES AND ENDED FISCAL YEAR 2014 WITH $73 BILLION IN SALES. THIS EQUATES TO A GROW RATE OF 3.6%, AND DEMONSTRATES SOME OF THE LATER PERIOD STRUGGLES WITH THE FAILED EXPANSION IN CANADA . SO KROGER BEGINS WITH A SOLID LEG-UP. THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO INCREASE TOTAL SALES AT A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN EITHER WAL-MART OR TARGET. IF THE PROFIT MARGIN REMAINS THE SAME DURING THE OBSERVATION PERIOD, YOU'D SEE TOTAL EARNINGS GROWTH THAT MIRRORS TOTAL REVENUE GROWTH. KROGER SAW A SLIGHT INCREASE IN ITS MARGIN WHILE BOTH WAL-MART AND TARGET SAW A DECREASE IN TOTAL PROFITABILITY. AS SUCH, KROGER'S TOTAL EARNINGS GREW BY A SLIGHTLY FASTER RATE THAN REVENUES (ABOUT 7% PER YEAR) WHEREAS THE OTHER TWO COMPANIES SAW TOTAL EARNINGS GROWTH THAT LAGGED OVERALL SALES GROWTH. ONCE MORE KROGER HAS A SOLID LEAD. NOTE THAT IN DEVELOPING THE GROWTH PROFILE OF AN INVESTMENT, THE IMPORTANT PART IS WHERE YOU START AND NOT WHERE YOU ARE. BOTH WAL-MART AND TARGET MAKE QUITE A BIT MORE THAN KROGER ON EACH DOLLAR WORTH OF SALES. KROGER SELLS MORE STUFF THAN TARGET, BUT TARGET MAKES A LOT MORE MONEY - ROUGHLY $1 BILLION MORE IN FISCAL-YEAR 2014. STILL, THE LOWER BASE AND SUBSEQUENT MAINTAINING OF MARGINS ALLOWED KROGER TO PROVIDE BETTER GROWTH. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO RAG ON "FINANCIAL ENGINEERING" VIA SHARE BUYBACKS, BUT REALLY IT'S JUST A WAY TO ALLOCATE CAPITAL. CONSISTENT SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BUY OUT PARTNERS ON YOUR BEHALF, SO YOUR UNDERLYING EARNINGS CLAIM GROWS AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE COMPANY. THESE THREE COMPANIES ARE CERTAINLY NO EXCEPTION: DECREASING COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING BY 4.3%, 2.8% AND 3.4% ANNUALLY. THAT'S A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE OVER A DECADE. IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT ELIMINATES ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR SHAREHOLDERS DURING THE TIME PERIOD. AS SUCH OF THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, SHAREHOLDERS SAW THEIR UNDERLYING EARNINGS CLAIM GROW AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE COMPANY BY ITSELF. KROGER ONCE MORE LEAD THE TRIO, RESULTING IN DOUBLE-DIGIT EARNINGS-PER-SHARE GROWTH. AT THIS POINT, KROGER HAS A REASONABLY SOLID ADVANTAGE. IT WOULD TAKE A LARGE COMPARATIVE REDUCTION IN WHAT SHAREHOLDERS WERE WILLING TO PAY FOR THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS IN ORDER FOR KROGER NOT TO TURN OUT BETTER INVESTMENT RESULTS. IN FACT, THE OPPOSITE HAPPENED. IF THE BEGINNING AND END EARNINGS MULTIPLE REMAIN THE SAME, SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION WILL BE EQUAL TO EARNINGS-PER-SHARE GROWTH. IN THIS CASE, ALL THREE COMPANIES SAW THE P/E RATIO BOUNCE ABOUT. KR'S INVESTORS SAW THE EARNINGS MULTIPLE MOVE FROM ABOUT 14 ALL THE WAY UP TO 20 - RESULTING IN SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION (AT NEARLY 16% PER YEAR) THAT GREATLY OUTPACED EPS GROWTH. ON THE OTHER HAND, BOTH WMT AND TGT EXPERIENCED P/E COMPRESSION DURING THIS PERIOD. AS SUCH, THE SHARE PRICE GROWTH FOR THESE TWO COMPANIES TRAILED THE EPS GROWTH. FINALLY, WE CAN LOOK AT THE DIVIDENDS. IN THIS RESPECT, THE COMPANIES HAVEN'T BEEN ALL THAT DIFFERENT. EACH HAS GROWN ITS PAYOUT BY A VERY SOLID RATE AND RETURNED AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TOTAL CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS. WAL-MART SHOWS MORE TOTAL FUNDS RETURNED, AND TARGET HAD A HIGHER GROWTH RATE, BUT IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED VIA A LARGER INCREASE IN THE PAYOUT RATIO. MOVING TO THE BOTTOM LINE, KROGER WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE 16.5% YEARLY RETURNS AS COMPARED TO 8.6% FOR WAL-MART AND UNDER 5% FOR TARGET. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE BUSINESSES AREN'T THAT DISSIMILAR. ALL THREE COMPANIES SELL SOME OF THE SAME GOODS, INCREASE SALES OVER THE YEARS, MAKE A SMALL PROFIT WITH LARGE QUANTITIES, REDUCE SHARE COUNT AND PAY AN INCREASING DIVIDEND. YET, THE INTERACTION OF THE COMPONENTS MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE INVESTOR. KROGER WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE MUCH HIGHER RETURNS FOR A FEW REASONS. THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO GROW A BIT FASTER, MAINTAINED ITS MARGINS, REDUCED ITS SHARE COUNT BY A GREATER RATE, AND INVESTORS WERE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR SHARES AS TIME WENT ON. MOVING FORWARD, THIS CAN BE HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT THE PROCESS. FIRST IT ANSWERS THE QUESTION PRESENTED BY THIS ARTICLE'S TITLE. JUST AS IMPORTANT, IT GIVES YOU SOME INSIGHT INTO THE POTENTIAL REPEATABILITY MOVING FORWARD. FOR INSTANCE, DUE TO KR'S LOWER PAYOUT RATIO, YOU MIGHT SUSPECT THAT THE COMPANY CAN CONTINUE TO INCREASE ITS DIVIDEND AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE OTHER TWO. AS AN EXAMPLE, TGT HAS ALREADY BEGUN ON ITS " GLIDE PATH " AS CONSTRAINED BY THE INCREASED PAYOUT RATIO. MOREOVER, THIS TYPE OF REVIEW MIGHT PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO WHAT TYPE OF GROWTH YOU COULD EXPECT IN THE FUTURE. KROGER SAW MUCH SUPERIOR SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION DUE TO AN EXPANSION IN ITS EARNINGS MULTIPLE. TODAY, THE SHARE PRICE IS EVEN HIGHER - INDICATING THAT PERHAPS A CAUTIOUS ASSUMPTION WOULD SURMISE THAT A LOWER RATHER THAN HIGHER VALUATION MIGHT BE POSSIBLE. IF SO, THE ACCELERATED SHARE PRICE GROWTH OF THE PAST WOULD SUDDENLY TURN INTO A LAG WHEREBY THE SHARE PRICE GROWS AT A SLOWER RATE THAN FUTURE EARNINGS-PER-SHARE GROWTH. ALTERNATIVELY, WAL-MART HAS SEEN ITS PRICE MOVE MATERIALLY LOWER - PERHAPS INDICATING THAT FUTURE SHARE PRICE GROWTH COULD OUTPACE EPS GROWTH . IN SHORT, KROGER WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPERIOR INVESTMENT RETURNS DUE TO FASTER GROWTH, RETIRING MORE SHARES AND THE FACT THAT INVESTORS WERE WILLING TO PAY A HIGHER VALUATION. THIS ILLUMINATES THE INVESTMENT HISTORY OF THESE THREE SECURITIES, BUT IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THIS MUST ALWAYS HOLD. INDEED, SOME OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT GOT KROGER TO THIS POINT - SUCH AS A HIGHER VALUATION - COULD BE MORE OF A DRAG ON RETURNS IN THE FUTURE. THE IDEA IS TO GET A HISTORICAL VIEW AS TO WHY CERTAIN EVENTS MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED AND THEN TO THINK ABOUT THE RELATIVE REPEATABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MOVING FORWARD.

EVEN WHEN THE PAST IS STARING AT HER AS SPECTATOR AND FORMER RIVAL M VENUS WILLIAMS DOESNT ENJOY TRIPS DOWN MEMORY LANE, AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE VIEW MAY BE. EVEN WHEN THE PAST IS STARING AT HER AS SPECTATOR AND FORMER RIVAL MARTINA HINGIS WAS DURING WILLIAMS THIRD ROUND U.S.  DAY : CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE EFFECTS OF HISTORICAL TRAUMA? OPEN MATCH FRIDAY THE 35-YEAR-OLD PREFERS TO LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD; LESS INTERESTED IN REVISITING HER 1992 FINALS RUN AS A DEBUTING, UNSEEDED TEENAGER WITH RED, WHITE AND BLUE BRAIDS AS DISCUSSING THE OPPONENT IN FRONT OF HER. THAT OPPONENT WAS ANOTHER SWISS STAR, 12TH-SEEDED BELINDA BENCIC, WHO WAS BORN THE SAME YEAR WILLIAMS FIRST APPEARED IN FLUSHING, AND WHO THREE WEEKS AGO BECAME JUST THE SECOND PERSON TO BEAT WILLIAMS SISTER, SERENA, THIS YEAR. ENTERING THE MATCH HAVING LOST A SET IN EACH OF THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS, THE 20RD-SEEDED WILLIAMS PUT ON AN IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE OVER THE TEENAGE THREAT, USING A SERVE STRAIGHT OUT OF HER PRIME TO DEFEAT BENCIC, 6-3, 6-4 AT ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM. AFTER ADVANCING TO THE TOURNAMENTS FOURTH ROUND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE YEARS, WILLIAMS MENTIONED SHE RECEIVED SOME ADVICE FOR THE MATCH FROM A CERTAIN TOP-RANKED PLAYER IN THE WORLD, WHO RECENTLY PLAYED BENCIC.  I THINK IT WORKED. WILLIAMS, WHO OVERCAME A 4-4 DEFICIT IN THE SECOND SET TO THE SECOND-HIGHEST SEED LEFT IN THE TOP HALF OF THE DRAW, NEXT WILL PLAY 19-YEAR-OLD QUALIFIER ANETT KONTAVEIT, WHO IS RANKED NO. 152 IN THE WORLD AND HAD NEVER WON A GRAND SLAM MATCH BEFORE THIS WEEK. WITH ONE MORE WIN, WILLIAMS WILL BE IN POSITION FOR A POTENTIAL SHOWDOWN WITH HER TOP-SEEDED SISTER IN THE QUARTERFINALS.  PROGENICS' FIRST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT, RELISTOR (METHYLNALTREXONE BROMIDE) FOR OPIOID-INDUCED CONSTIPATION, IS PARTNERED WITH AND MARKETED BY VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS INTERNATIONAL, INC. DESPITE BEING FAR TOO EXPERIENCED TO LOOK TOO FAR AHEAD, WILLIAMS ADMITTED THE LOOMING BATTLE IN WHICH SERENAS PURSUIT OF A CALENDAR GRAND SLAM WOULD BE AT STAKE HAS CROSSED HER MIND. HOW COULD IT NOT? AS MUCH AS SHES TRIED TO MAKE THEIR PREVIOUS 26, OFTEN AWKWARD PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS (15-11, SERENA) FEEL LIKE ANY OTHER MATCH, WILLIAMS HAS TO CONSIDER MUCH MORE THAN JUST FACING THE WORLDS BEST PLAYER.  OPEN MATCH WINS, BEHIND HER SISTER. WE BOTH HAVE TO GET THERE. I THINK WE BOTH HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, BUT THERE ARE NO GIVENS. [OUR] FIRST MATCH WAS P
116	(PARIS) THE SUDAN REVOLUTIONARY FRONT (SRF), A COALITION OF REBEL GROUPS, ON WEDNESDAY CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THE DECISION OF THE AFRICAN UNION PEACE AND SECURITY COUNCIL (AUPSC) IN FAVOUR OF A PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING. THE ARMED OPPOSITION GROUPS MADE THEIR DECISION IN THEIR SECOND MEETING WITH INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ENVOYS HELD IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL PARIS TO DISCUSS POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND DRAW A MAP FOR A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE IN SUDAN. THE MEETING TAKES PLACE AFTER A DECISION BY THE AUPSC ON 25 AUGUST REITERATING ITS SUPPORT FOR A PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING GATHERING ALL THE ARMED GROUPS AND POLITICAL PARTIES BUT THE RULING NATIONAL CONGRESS PARTY (NCP) REJECTS THIS ROADMAP. SRF EXTERNAL RELATIONS SECRETARY, YASIR ARMAN,, WHO IS ALSO THE SPLM-N SECRETARY-GENERAL, TOLD SUDAN TRIBUNE THAT THE SRF URGED THE INTERNATIONAL ENVOYS TO BACK-THE RECENT DECISION OF THE AFRICAN UNION 539 IN SUPPORT OF A COMPRESSIVE AND INCLUSIVE NATIONAL DIALOGUE PROCESS IN SUDAN. ARMAN FURTHER REVEALED THAT THE ENVOYS HAVE AGREED TO BACK UP THE AUPSCS DECISION ON NATIONAL DIALOGUE. HE ASSERTED THAT THE DECISION WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL WHICH WILL SUPPORT IT, PARTICULARLY SINCE THERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT ANY MATTER THAT WINS REGIONAL CONSENSUS SHOULD RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS AS WELL. THE SECOND MEETING WAS ATTENDED BY US ENVOY TO SUDAN AND SOUTH SUDAN DONALD BOOTH, BRITISH COUNTERPART, MATTHEW CANNELL IN ADDITION TO THE HEAD OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AT THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTRY JEAN-CHRISTOPHE BELLIARD. ALSO, PRESENT WERE A REPRESENTATIVE OF NORWAY AND THE EU ENVOY FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA ALEXANDER RONDOS. DURING THE MEETING, THE SRF GROUPS STRESSED THEIR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THE UNITY OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, WHICH BESIDES THE REBEL ALLIANCE, INCLUDE THE NATIONAL UMMA PARTY (NUP), NATIONAL CONSENSUS FORCES (NCF) AND CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS. ARMAN APPEALED TO RUSSIA AND CHINA TO SUPPORT THE AFRICAN ROADMAP BECAUSE IT SETS THE FOUNDATION FOR PEACE, SECURITY AND DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH WILL ENABLE SUDAN TO ENTER INTO A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, INCLUDING RUSSIA AND CHINA. NO DEVELOPMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED AT TIMES OF WAR, HE SAID. THE MEETING WAS ADDRESSED VIA CONFERENCE CALL BY NUP LEADER AL-SADIG AL-MAHDI, NCF CHAIRMAN, FAROUK ABU ISSA, AMIN MAKKI MADANI, HEAD OF THE ALLIANCE OF THE SUDANESE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS AND GAHZI SALAH AL-DIN ATTABANI THE LEADER OF THE REFORM NOW MOVEMENT (RNM), A SPLINTER FACTION OF THE RULING PARTY. ARMAN SAID THE PARTICIPATION OF ATTABANI IN THE MEETING MARKS A PROGRESS IN THE RELATION BETWEEN THE RNM AND THE SRF. HE POINTED OUT THAT THE SRF GROUPS WILL HOLD A THREE-DAY MEETING IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL TO DISCUSS THE POLITICAL SITUATION, ADDING THE MEETING SHOULD COME OUT WITH A ROAD MAP FOR ALL ISSUES OF PEACE AND NATIONAL DIALOGUE IN SUDAN. HE SAID PREPARATIONS WERE UNDERWAY FOR A MEETING OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, BUT HE DID NOT GIVE A SPECIFIC DATE FOR THAT MEETING. ALSO, ARMAN REITERATED THAT SRF ARE COMMITTED TO THE UNITY OF THE OPPOSITION AND TO A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE SETTLEMENT, AWAY FROM PARTIAL SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE PROMISED THE SUDANESE PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE ROADMAP TO END WAR. THE BALL IS NOW IN KHARTOUMS COURT. IT IS THE PARTY THAT HAD INITIATED THESE WARS AND IT PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO BRING THEM TO AN END, HE ADDED. LAST SUNDAY, THE DIALOGUE MECHANISM SOFTENED THIS POSITION ON THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING AND ANNOUNCED ACCEPTING TO MEET THE REBEL GROUPS BEFORE THE PROCESS TO DISCUSS THE GUARANTEES ENABLING THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DIALOGUE CONFERENCE IN KHARTOUM. IN PREVIOUS STATEMENTS, THE SPLM-N SECRETARY GENERAL HAD DISMISSED GOVERNMENT PRESS REPORTS THAT KHARTOUM WOULD NOT MIND ATTENDING A PRELIMINARY MEETING WITH SRF AND ARMED GROUPS AS AN ATTEMPT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO CAUSE A RIFT IN THE OPPOSITION FORCES, PARTICULARLY BETWEEN THE SRF AND THE NUP OF SADIQ AL-MAHDI. THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING S SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD IMPLEMENT BEFORE THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO CREATE A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT. THESE INCLUDE A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND HUMANITARIAN ACCESS FOR CIVILIANS IN THE REBEL HELD AREAS, POLITICAL FREEDOMS AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. US PROPOSAL FOR STOPPING HOSTILITIES US ENVOY DONALD BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT TO THE MEDIA, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED THAT THE REBELS SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT OMER AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. FOLLOWING THE JOINT MEETING, BOOTH MET WITH REBEL GROUPS FROM DARFUR REGION AND DISCUSSED THEIR DEMAND FOR RENEGOTIATING THE DOHA DOCUMENT FOR PEACE IN DARFUR. BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED TO THE REBEL GROUPS THAT THEY SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. SUDAN TRIBUNE LEARNT THAT BOOTH ALSO HELD A SEPARATE MEETING WITH THE SPLM-N TO DISCUSS NEGOTIATIONS WITH KHARTOUM ON A DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES DOCUMENT, INCLUDING A CEASEFIRE, AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO CIVILIANS IN THE SPLM-N CONTROLLED AREAS. ON ITS PART, SUDAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT - ABDEL WAHID AL-NUR ISSUED A STATEMENT REITERATING ITS DEMAND FOR PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS, DISARMING THE JANJAWEED AND THE REMOVAL OF NEW-COMERS FROM THE LANDS AND HAWAKEER. THE STATEMENT CLEARLY PROVIDED THAT THE GROUP WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE WITH KHARTOUM UNTIL THOSE "CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES" WERE MET.
117	UPDATE. FROM A NOTORIOUS CON MAN TO CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES, THIS GRAND HOME -- NAY, THIS GRAND COMPOUND -- IN THE HEART OF THE LOS FELIZ NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES HAS HOUSED QUITE A CAST OF CHARACTERS OVER THE YEARS. WITH 14 BEDROOMS AND EIGHT BATHROOMS, IT'S RICH AND BRIMMING WITH POSSIBILITIES. BUILT IN 1929 BY ARCHITECT HARLEY S. BRADLEY FOR A MAN NAMED RUDOLPH ROSENBERG , IT WAS SOLD THE SAME YEAR TO MUSIC STORE MAGNATE BEN PLATT . OVER THE YEARS, PLATT HIRED ARCHITECTS PAUL R. WILLIAMS AND ALBERT E. HANSEN , TO EXPAND IT, ADDING A POOL, TENNIS COURTS, AND ANOTHER STORY TO BRING IT TO ITS CURRENT 10,000-SQUARE-FOOT MEASUREMENT. THE NEXT OWNER WAS A NOTORIOUS CON MAN NAMED C.C. JULIAN , WHOM LISTING AGENT DAVID SOLOMON DESCRIBES AS THE BERNIE MADOFF OF HIS DAY.  IN THE LATE 1950S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OWNER TOOK OVER: THE SAINT COLUMBAN'S FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY, A GROUP OF CATHOLIC MISSIONARY PRIESTS  WHO STILL LIVE  THE MOST NOTEWORTHY HISTORIC FEATURE IS A CAVE THAT LEADS TO A HIDDEN WINE CELLAR TO A FULL SPEAK-EASY USED DURING PROHIBITION. THERE ARE ALSO QUARTERS FOR LIVE-IN STAFF. SOLOMON SAYS IT WILL TAKE THE RIGHT BUYER TO BRING THE HOME TO PRESENT-DAY STANDARDS, BUT THE RETURN COULD BE HUGE. CURRENTLY LISTED FOR $5,499,000, THE PROPERTY  COULD BE VALUED AT OVER $12 MILLION POSTRENOVATION BASED ON ITS SIZE, HISTORY, AND LOCATION. "WHEN IT'S REDONE, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES IN LOS ANGELES," HE SAYS. ALTHOUGH THE HOME IS SET BACK FROM THE ROAD, IT FEATURES AMAZING CITY VIEWS AND IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HOLLYWOOD'S GREEK THEATRE AND GRIFFITH PARK. AS FOR THE NEIGHBORS, THINK HOLLYWOOD STARS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOME BEHIND THIS PROPERTY USED TO BE ROBERT PATTINSON 'S LOVE NEST WITH THEN-GIRLFRIEND KRISTEN STEWART . THE "TWILIGHT" STAR SOLD THE HOME IN 2014, AND NOW JIM PARSONS OF "THE BIG BANG THEORY" LIVES THERE.  SOLOMON SAYS WHILE IT COULD BE ANYONE FROM A SINGLE FAMILY TO A PRODUCTION COMPANY, THE LUCKY OWNER WILL DEFINITELY POSSESS ONE QUALITY. "THE RIGHT BUYER WILL BE SOMEONE WHO HAS AN APPRECIATION FOR THE TYPE OF HOME THEY JUST DON'T BUILD ANYMORE," HE SAID. "THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS."

ANOTHER MAN SELLING BOOKS WASHED AWAY THE VOMIT. A MAN NAMED CHARLIE MEDINA SAT AT THE SAME SPOT A FEW DAYS LATER, UNABLE TO REMEMBER HIS NAME BEFORE HE FELL INTO A TRANCE WITH HIS JAW OPEN AND HIS EYES DILATED. AND THE LOVERS.

THE PEOPLE HERE ON THIS STRETCH OF 125TH STREET IN EAST HARLEM MAY CHANGE, BUT THE DRUG REMAINS THE SAME: K2 , ALSO CALLED SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA, A POTENT MIX OF HERBS AND CHEMICALS THAT HAS BECOME WIDELY USED AMONG HOMELESS PEOPLE IN NEW YORK CITY. CROWDS OF UP TO 80 OR 100 HOMELESS PEOPLE COME IN ON BUSES FROM A NEARBY SHELTER ON RANDALLS ISLAND, DRAWN BY HEROIN RECOVERY CLINICS NEARBY, AND SPEND THE DAY THERE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS CHEAPER NARCOTIC. THE BLOCK BETWEEN PARK AND LEXINGTON AVENUES APPEARS AT TIMES TO BE A STREET OF ZOMBIES. THE ZOMBIES ARE JUST A SYMPTOM OF THE PROBLEM. THE RESIDENT EVIL I WAS REFERREDTO ABOVE IS THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY, WHICH REFUSES TO CLEAR THESE ADDICTS OFF THE STREETS. THIS ISN'T THE KIND OF CRIME THAT REQUIRES FANCY DETECTIVE WORK TO SOLVE; THESE PEOPLE ARE SO OUT IN THE OPEN, LYING ON BUSY STREETS, THAT THEY CAN'T BE AVOIDED. THE REASON THEY ARE THERE IS BECAUSE OF LAX LAWS ABOUT HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS, LAX LAWS FOR DRUG ADDICTS (I BELIEVE LIBERALS AND RAND PAUL CALL IT "DECRIMINALIZING LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS"), AND A LACK OF WILL ON THE PART OF THE POLICE TO KEEP THE STREETS SAFE AND CLEAR. AND THE LACK OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE POLICE COMES FROM THE TOP, FROM COMMISSAR DE BLASIO. IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS HARLEM HAS BECOME A TRENDY PLACE TO LIVE FOR WHITE LIBERALS, WHO WOULD SPEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR BROWNSTONES IN DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOODS. ON THE UPSIDE, THE PRICE OF DRUGS AND PROSTITUTES ARE PROBABLY CHEAPER THERE. I ALSO KNOW THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS AN OFFICE THERE. KEEPING THE STREETS CLEAR OF DRUG ADDICTS IS NOT A DIFFICULT THING. WHEN SOCIETY HAS LOST THE WILL TO FIGHT BACK, THE STREETS BECOME LITTERED WITH DISGUSTING AND INSANE ZOMBIE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO DRUGGED UP THAT THEY THINK NOTHING OF VOMITING, DEFECATING, OR COPULATING ON A PUBLIC SIDEWALK.

HOT LIX 10:30 P.M. JASON D. WILLIAMS "I CALL IT MY ROCK 'N' ROLL INFERNO," TORCH SAYS. "BECAUSE I WORK THE CROWD. ... AND CATER TO RIDERS, MOTORCYCLE, MAINLY." WHEN HE ARRIVES, EVENT STAFF CLEAR OUT A 25-FOOT RADIUS FOR HIS PERFORMING AREA, WHICH IS NEVER ON STAGE, BUT IS SOMETIMES IN FRONT OF ONE. TORCH PREFERS TO BE ON THE GROUND, WITH HIS AUDIENCE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE THE NUANCES OF HIS DANGEROUS PERFORMANCE. THE RADIUS IS TO KEEP THE AUDIENCE SAFE FROM THE BIG AND FLASHY MOVES, SUCH AS THE 8- AND 10-FOOT FLAMES SHOT FROM HIS MOTORCYCLE, THE 30- AND 40-FOOT CURLS STEMMING FROM HIS FLAMETHROWER AND TO KEEP THEM A REASONABLE DISTANCE FROM THE TALL FLAMES HE BREATHES. TORCH ALSO USES AN ARRAY OF NUNCHUCKS, A BULLWHIP AND A FIRE STAFF (THAT LOOKS LIKE A BATON) TO SPIN, CRACK AND WIELD FIRE IN CIRCLES, ARCS AND OTHER SHAPES. "WHEN YOU SAY 'FIRE SHOW,' YOU PICTURE SOMEONE DOING A VERY SLOW PACE," TORCH SAYS. "MOST [FIRE PERFORMERS] ARE WEIRD LOOKING DUDES TRYING TO LOOK SEXY [WHILE PERFORMING]. THEY HAVE THEIR SHIRT OFF AND HAVE LONG HAIR OR HAVE GIRLS IN HULA HOOPS.  NONE OF US THAT ARE ON THAT LIST SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE, BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME SEE A BAND LIKE PRIEST OR MY MATE DEE [SNIDER] FROM TWISTED SISTER, WE WANNA GIVE YOU A GOOD TIME, WE WANNA HELP YOU FORGET ALL THE TROUBLES AND THE WORRIES IN THE WORLD. "A LOT OF THE FIRE PERFORMERS DO ONE THING AT A SLOW PACE AND CAN DRAG IT OUT FOR 5 OR 10 MINUTES." BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU GET WITH HIS SHOW, BECAUSE HE'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE FIRE PERFORMER. "MINE HAS LOTS OF ENERGY, WORKING THE CROWD AND GETTING LOTS OF ENERGY GOING," HE SAYS.  CANVAS EMPOWERS BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES TO COLLECT INFORMATION USING MOBILE DEVICES; INSTANTLY SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH COLLEAGUES, PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS; AND SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATE THE DATA WITH THEIR BUSINESSES EXISTING BACKEND SYSTEMS SO THAT DECISION MAKERS GAIN ACCESS TO ACCURATE, REAL-TIME INFORMATION FROM THEIR WORKFORCE.  I TAKE THE KIT TO MY GP, WHERE THE NURSE OR PHLEBOTOMIST TAKES THE BLOOD, LABELS IT AND I POST IT OFF. "IT'S MORE IN-YOUR-FACE ... TO GET THE WHOLE CROWD'S ATTENTION." RATHER THAN A BIG, LONG SET, TORCH WILL DO VARIOUS ACTS, USUALLY AT 30 SECONDS TO MINUTE EACH. ONCE SOMETHING STOPS BEING INTERESTING, HE STOPS DOING IT. HE FEEDS ON THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CROWD AND EXERTS SO MUCH ENERGY WITH EACH PERFORMANCE THAT HE USUALLY FEELS SICK AFTERWARD, FROM ALL THE EFFORT SPENT AND THE HIGH DEMAND IT PUTS ON HIS BODY. WHILE DOING A SHOW, "TO PUMP UP ENERGY, I'LL BE RUNNING AROUND LIKE A MANIAC," HE SAYS. BUT THE TECHNIQUE OF EATING FIRE TAKES DISCIPLINE, INCLUDING HIGH CONTROL OF HIS BREATHING.  THE FARM'S SENIOR MANAGERS SAY THE NEW VILLAGE WILL BE USED A PROTOTYPE FOR OTHER FARMING COMMUNITIES. GOING FULL THROTTLE TO AN INSTANT STOP MEANS A LOT OF PRACTICE. TORCH GOT HIS START IN 2009 WHEN HE LEARNED HOW TO USE BASIC FIRE PERFORMING EQUIPMENT FROM A FIRE-EATING GO-GO DANCER AT A DALLAS NIGHTCLUB, WHERE HE WORKED. AFTER FEW 10- AND 15-MINUTE TEACHING SESSIONS, HE BOUGHT HIS OWN EQUIPMENT AND PERFORMED A TIMES A NIGHT SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK. HE STARTED TOURING IN 2012 AND ENJOYS STAYING ON THE ROAD.  "ABOVE ALL, I'M A BIKER," HE SAYS ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE.  MAIN, EL DORADO. "I LOVE MY BIKER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND WHAT WE REPRESENT, WHICH IS GREAT CAUSES." IT INFLUENCES THE VENUES HE PICKS FOR PERFORMANCE, WHICH INCLUDE PLENTY OF BIKER RALLIES. "YOU BECOME FAMILY WITH A LOT OF [PEOPLE] AT THESE RALLIES," HE SAYS. "BIKERS ARE A CLOSE KNIT GROUP OF PEOPLE. A LOT GOES INTO THESE RALLIES [INCLUDING] A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE." NAN WHAT'S UP ON 09/25/2 FOR MOST PEOPLE, BREATHING FIRE IS JUST AN EXPRESSION. BUT FOR TORCH, IT'S A WAY OF LIFE. CHAD LAND, WHO PREFERS HIS STAGE NAME TORCH, TOURS THE COUNTRY FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR -- USUALLY FROM MARCH THROUGH OCTOBER AT VARIOUS BIKER RALLIES -- ENTERTAINING BIKERS WITH HIS FIRE PERFORMANCE.

OR, ARE THEY EXPLOITING THEIR WORKERS BY DENYING THEM BENEFITS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY AVAILABLE AT MORE TRADITIONAL JOBS? FEDERAL LAWMAKERS RETURNED REPEATEDLY TO THE SECOND QUESTION AT A HEARING ON TUESDAY THAT FOCUSED ON HOW CONGRESS SHOULD REGULATE SO-CALLED ON-DEMAND ECONOMY FIRMS LIKE UBER, AIRBNB AND THUMBTACK (WHICH MATCHES USERS WITH LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS). PERHAPS PREDICTABLY, THE DEBATE OFTEN FELL ALONG PARTISAN LINES. REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE, WHICH HELD THE HEARING, EXPRESSED WARINESS ABOUT REGULATING THE INDUSTRY. DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INDUSTRYS POTENTIAL TO DENY BENEFITS TO WORKERS AND NOTED THAT WOMEN AND AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE OFTEN UNDERREPRESENTED IN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS IN THE TECH INDUSTRY, WHICH THE COMPANIES SAY THEY ARE PART OF. I FOR ONE AM MORE CONCERNED ABOUT EXISTING REGULATIONS HURTING NEW JOBS THAN I AM ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEW REGULATIONS, SAID REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R) OF TEXAS, WHO CHAIRS THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, MANUFACTURING AND TRADE. NOTING THAT THE HEARING WAS PART OF A SERIES LOOKING AT SO-CALLED DISRUPTIVE INNOVATIONS SUCH AS INTERNET OF THINGS DEVICES, HE ADDED, AS WE LOOK AT ANY DISRUPTER, WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES, IS MORE REGULATION NEEDED OR IS SOMEONE JUST WORRIED ABOUT CHANGES TO THE STATUS QUO? BUT REP. JAN SCHAKOWSKY (D) OF ILLINOIS, THE SUBCOMMITTEES RANKING MEMBER, NOTED THAT THE TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES BROUGHT BY SUCH TECHNOLOGICALLY-ENABLED FREELANCE WORK WERE NOT ALWAYS POSITIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR OLDER WORKERS WHO WERE USED TO RECEIVING BENEFITS LIKE HEALTH INSURANCE AND SOCIAL SECURITY IN FULL-TIME POSITIONS. THE WORKERS ARE ATOMIZED AND UNABLE TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN IN THEIR OWN INTEREST, AND THIS SHIFT [MEANS THAT] MANY WORK-RELATED RISKS GO FROM EMPLOYERS TO WORKERS, SHE SAID. WITH 80 MILLION AMERICANS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN SOME OF FORM OF FREELANCE WORK WHETHER DRIVING FOR RIDE-SHARING SERVICES LIKE UBER OR LYFT OR PUTTING TOGETHER FURNITURE AND MAKING FOOD DELIVERIES FOR TASKRABBIT, PARTICIPATION IN THE SO-CALLED ON-DEMAND ECONOMY HAS BEEN GROWING DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. COMMITTEE MEMBERS POINTED OUT THAT THE INDUSTRY HAD GENERATED $15 BILLION IN REVENUE IN 2013, ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY ACCOUNTING FIRM PRICEWATERHOUSE COOPERS. AND THE INDUSTRY IS PROJECTED TO GROW TO $335 BILLION IN TEN YEARS. TESTIMONY DURING THE HEARING OFTEN FOCUSED ON DEFENDING THE INDUSTRY FROM CLAIMS THAT IT EXPLOITS WORKERS, THE HILL REPORTS. WITNESSES INCLUDED LUCEELE SMITH, WHO DRIVES FOR UBER, AND MICHAEL BECKERMAN, HEAD OF LOBBYING GROUP THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION, WHO PREVIOUSLY WORKED ON CAPITOL HILL, INCLUDING WORKING FOR REP. FRED UPTON (R) OF MICHIGAN, WHO CHAIRS THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE. I HAVE WORKED IN TRADITIONAL JOBS BEFORE, BUT THERES NOTHING ELSE OUT THERE WHERE YOU CAN SET YOUR OWN SCHEDULE AND YOUR OWN GOALS, SAID MS. SMITH, AN AIR FORCE VETERAN WHO SAID SHE USED THE INCOME FROM DRIVING FOR THE SERVICE TO PAY FOR TRAVEL TO SEE HER FAMILY IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS. THE HEARING MARKED ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS HAVE FOCUSED ON WHETHER THE SHARING ECONOMY DESERVES FURTHER REGULATION, THE HILL NOTES. SO FAR, CALLS FOR FURTHER REGULATION HAVE COME FROM DEMOCRATS, SUCH AS SEN. MARK WARNER OF WEST VIRGINIA, AND FROM DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED STATEHOUSES SUCH AS MASSACHUSETTS. BUT THE HILL REPORTS THAT NO LEGISLATION ON REGULATING SHARING-ECONOMY BENEFITS HAS BEEN FILED YET. THAT TREND LOOKS LIKE IT IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE, WITH REP. UPTON, THE COMMITTEES CHAIR, SAYING ON TUESDAY THAT AT A TIME WHEN JOBS ARE STILL HARD TO FIND AND BALANCING THE BUDGET IS A CHALLENGE, WE SHOULD NOT RISK HASTY CALLS TO REGULATE. SOME STUDIES REVIEWED BY THE COMMITTEE FOUND THAT RIDE-SHARING CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE TAXI SERVICE BY DECREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS, AS ONE STUDY IN NEW YORK FOUND, OR BY MAKING ADDITIONAL RIDES AVAILABLE FOR PATRONS WHO FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET A TRADITIONAL CAB, AS ONE SURVEY OF LOW-INCOME LOS ANGELES NEIGHBORHOODS SHOWED. DESPITE THE ONGOING LABOR DISPUTES, THE SERVICES ARE GENERATING NEW JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY UNDEREMPLOYED, SEVERAL WITNESSES SAID. WEVE HEARD A LOT OF STORIES OF PEOPLE WHOVE BEEN DOWN ON THEIR LUCK, PEOPLE WHOVE JUST LEFT THE MILITARY, PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR JOBS, OR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WHAT NEXT TO DO IN THEIR LIVES, AND THEYRE ABLE TO COME TO THESE PLATFORMS, COME ONLINE, AND START FINDING NEW WORK, SAID JONATHAN LIEBER, CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR THE MARKETPLACE APP THUMBTACK.

122	LAST POST IN THIS THREAD I MENTIONED THAT I HAD OBTAINED SOME 'HONDURAN' MAHOGANY FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD ON THE CABINET. I WASN'T ENTIRELY PLEASED WITH THE MATERIAL I RECEIVED AS I HAD WANTED QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY, WHILE 7 OUT OF THE 10 BOARDS RECEIVED WERE NOT FITTING THAT DESCRIPTION AT ALL. I REALIZE NOW THAT QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY IS NOT GENERALLY WHAT WAS BEING CUT - LOGS ARE INVARIABLY SAWN THROUGH AND THROUGH - AND THUS QS STOCK IS LESS COMMONLY AVAILABLE THAN I HAD THOUGHT. SO, TRYING TO OBTAIN MORE (IN BULK) IN THE HOPE OF SCORING SOME MORE QUARTERSAWN BOARDS WAS NOT LOOKING PROMISING. NONE OF THE RETAILERS I SPOKE WITH SEEMED EVEN WILLING TO DO A SORT FOR A FEW BOARDS, AND FAIR ENOUGH. AFTER FURTHER RUMINATION, I DECIDED IT WOULD BE BEST TO CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SPECIES FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD, A SPECIES THAT WAS TYPICALLY CUT FOR QUARTERSAWN FROM THE GET-GO AND WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD MATCH FOR THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE REST OF THE CABINET. I'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED WOODS SUCH AS MAHOGANY, BLACK CHERRY, AND SWISS PEAR WOOD FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD. NONE OF THOSE WERE LIKELY TO FIT THE REQUIREMENTS I HAD IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION, SO I KEPT LOOKING. I FINALLY CAME ACROSS A SUITABLE MATERIAL, AND IT IS BOTANICALLY RELATED TO BUBINGA (WHICH IS GUIBORTIA TESSMANII OR GUIBORTIA PELLAGRINIANA OR GUIBORTIA DEMEUSEI). THIS IS A WOOD CALLED SHEDUA, AKA OVANGKOL, WHICH COMES FROM THE SPECIES GUIBORTIA EHIE. THIS IS A SOMEWHAT SMALLER TREE THAN THOSE SPECIES FROM WHICH BUBINGA IS OBTAINED, HOWEVER IN MANY RESPECTS SHEDUA SHARES THE SAME WORKING QUALITIES AS BUBINGA. THE WOOD COMES FROM WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES LIKE GABON AND CAMEROON, AND THE TREE IS MORE COMMONLY UTILIZED FOR ITS GUM RESIN, CALLED CONGO COPAL, THAN ITS TIMBER. THE TIMBER IS NOT VERY COMMONLY AVAILABLE, AND DOES SEEM TO FIND A CERTAIN FAVOR AMONG THE GUITAR-MAKING COMMUNITY. HERE'S A GUITAR WITH A SHEDUA BACK: (FROM:HTTP://WWW.GUITARBENCH.COM/2012/01/04/SHEDUA-TONEWOOD-PROFILE/) AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS A MORE BROWNISH CAST THAN BUBINGA, BUT SHARES THE BLACK STREAKS. COMPARING SHEDUA'S MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WITH BUBINGA, IT IS VERY CLOSE INDEED, BEING VERY SLIGHTLY LIGHTER AND DENSER, A LITTLE LOWER IN VOLUMETRIC CHANGE DUE TO MOISTURE CONTENT CHANGE, A SLIGHT BIT SOFTER IN TERMS OF CRUSHING STRENGTH AND A HAIR STIFFER IN BENDING STRENGTH (MODULUS OF ELASTICITY). I IMAGINE, THEREFORE, THAT IT SHOULD HAVE FAIRLY SIMILAR WORKING QUALITIES TO BUBINGA. THIS IMAGE FROM HEARNE HARDWOODS SHOWS THE VARIED APPEARANCE OF SHEDUA BASED ON THE GRAIN ORIENTATION: AS IT SO HAPPENS, HEARNE WAS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THE US WHICH HAD ANY STOCK OF SHEDUA AT ALL, LET ALONE QS AND/OR FIGURED STOCK. IN FACT, THEY HAD A DECENTLY SIZED STACK OF 12/4 MATERIAL, 6~12" WIDE, 16' LONG OR LONGER, AND SOME OF IT WAS QUARTERSAWN. CONSIDERING FEW OTHER RETAILERS HAVE ANY OF THIS MATERIAL, IT WAS AMAZING TO COME ACROSS SUCH NICE STOCK. THEY ALSO TOOK TIME TO REPLY TO MY EMAILS, AND SEND PICTURES, ONCE I HAD DEMONSTRATED SOLID INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL - - AND HAD GIVEN THEM MY CREDIT CARD INFO! THEY SEEM TO BE A WOOD RETAILER SPECIALIZING IN HIGH QUALITY AND RARE MATERIALS. THEY SENT ME SOME PICTURES OF A COUPLE OF BOARDS WHICH MATCHED THE REQUIREMENTS I GAVE THEM, SWABBED WITH ALCOHOL TO MAKE THE FIGURE A BIT CLEARER THOUGH NOT SHOWING THE TONE WHICH WILL BE OBTAINED WITH A PROPER FINISH: THEY WERE WONDERING IF I WAS SO DETERMINED TO HAVE QUARTERSAWN BECAUSE I WAS A LUTHIER, HOWEVER I LET THEM KNOW THEY WERE GUESSING WRONG. I DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC REASONS FOR WANTING QUARTERSAWN MATERIAL OF COURSE. THE GUY WHO SENT ME THE PICTURES STATED THAT THESE TWO BOARDS MIGHT BE THE NICEST IN THE ENTIRE PILE. I ASKED FOR A FOLLOW-UP PIC OF THE END GRAIN OF THE TWO BOARDS, TO CONFIRM THEY WERE WHAT I WANTED IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION: AND THE OTHER BOARD, ABOUT 12" WIDE: THE STICKS ARE HARD TO SCALE UNTIL YOU NOTICE THAT A FORKLIFT IS DOING THE LIFTING.... THE STOCK LOOKED GOOD TO ME. THE PRICE WAS STEEP, AT $35/BOARD FOOT, SO EACH OF THOSE BOARDS WAS $1400.00, HOWEVER I WAS ABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE COST SOMEWHAT BY SELLING A PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY-ACQUIRED MAHOGANY OFF TO ANOTHER WOODWORKER IN MY BUILDING. I ORDERED THOSE TWO BOARDS AND THEY SHOULD BE AT MY SHOP IN ANOTHER 3~4 DAYS. I THINK THIS WOOD WILL GO VERY NICELY WITH THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE BULK OF THE CABINET: I THINK THE CAD REPRESENTATION OF THE SHEDUA IS APPROXIMATE AT BEST. IN RECENT DAYS I HAVE REVISED THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DIVIDERS ON THE LOWER BANK OF DRAWERS, MAKING THEM STRAIGHT INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM MATCH THE DRAWER CURVES, AND RECESSING THEM BACK SLIGHTLY - THIS FOR AMONG OTHER REASONS, TO INCREASE THE SHADOW LINE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE CURVED DRAWERS AND THE SURROUNDING FRAMEWORK: THE DIVIDER'S OUTER ARRISES WILL ADDITIONALLY BE CHAMFERED. THE DRAWERS THEMSELVES WILL HAVE A BEADED PERIMETER DETAIL, AND HAVE THE DRAWER SIDEWALL THROUGH- TENONS POKING OUT, NEITHER OF WHICH IS NOT ILLUSTRATED YET, AND THE HANDLE DESIGN FOR THE DRAWERS REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION. LIKEWISE, THE UPPER SET OF DRAWERS AND DOORS REMAINS JUST A FRONTAL PLANE AT THE MOMENT WITH NO ALLOWANCE FOR SET BACK, CHAMFERING, ETC.. GETTING THERE! THANKS FOR VISITING THE CARPENTRY WAY. GOT SOME MACHINE'S COMING SOON SO I AM WORKING ON GETTING MY SHOP READY FOR THAT - THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE SUBJECT OF THE NEXT POST.

WILLIAMS "I CALL IT MY ROCK 'N' ROLL INFERNO," TORCH SAYS. "BECAUSE I WORK THE CROWD.  AND CATER TO RIDERS, MOTORCYCLE, MAINLY." WHEN HE ARRIVES, EVENT STAFF CLEAR OUT A 25-FOOT RADIUS FOR HIS PERFORMING AREA, WHICH IS NEVER ON STAGE, BUT IS SOMETIMES IN FRONT OF ONE. TORCH PREFERS TO BE ON THE GROUND, WITH HIS AUDIENCE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE THE NUANCES OF HIS DANGEROUS PERFORMANCE. THE RADIUS IS TO KEEP THE AUDIENCE SAFE FROM THE BIG AND FLASHY MOVES, SUCH AS THE 8- AND 10-FOOT FLAMES SHOT FROM HIS MOTORCYCLE, THE 30- AND 40-FOOT CURLS STEMMING FROM HIS FLAMETHROWER AND TO KEEP THEM A REASONABLE DISTANCE FROM THE TALL FLAMES HE BREATHES. TORCH ALSO USES AN ARRAY OF NUNCHUCKS, A BULLWHIP AND A FIRE STAFF (THAT LOOKS LIKE A BATON) TO SPIN, CRACK AND WIELD FIRE IN CIRCLES, ARCS AND OTHER SHAPES. "WHEN YOU SAY 'FIRE SHOW,' YOU PICTURE SOMEONE DOING A VERY SLOW PACE," TORCH SAYS. "MOST [FIRE PERFORMERS] ARE WEIRD LOOKING DUDES TRYING TO LOOK SEXY [WHILE PERFORMING]. THEY HAVE THEIR SHIRT OFF AND HAVE LONG HAIR OR HAVE GIRLS IN HULA HOOPS. "A LOT OF THE FIRE PERFORMERS DO ONE THING AT A SLOW PACE AND CAN DRAG IT OUT FOR 5 OR 10 MINUTES." BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU GET WITH HIS SHOW, BECAUSE HE'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE FIRE PERFORMER. "MINE HAS LOTS OF ENERGY, WORKING THE CROWD AND GETTING LOTS OF ENERGY GOING," HE SAYS. "IT'S MORE IN-YOUR-FACE ... TO GET THE WHOLE CROWD'S ATTENTION." RATHER THAN A BIG, LONG SET, TORCH WILL DO VARIOUS ACTS, USUALLY AT 30 SECONDS TO A MINUTE EACH. ONCE SOMETHING STOPS BEING INTERESTING, HE STOPS DOING IT. HE FEEDS ON THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CROWD AND EXERTS SO MUCH ENERGY WITH EACH PERFORMANCE THAT HE USUALLY FEELS SICK AFTERWARD, FROM ALL THE EFFORT SPENT AND THE HIGH DEMAND IT PUTS ON HIS BODY. WHILE DOING A SHOW, "TO PUMP UP ENERGY, I'LL BE RUNNING AROUND LIKE A MANIAC," HE SAYS. BUT THE TECHNIQUE OF EATING FIRE TAKES DISCIPLINE, INCLUDING HIGH CONTROL OF HIS BREATHING. GOING FULL THROTTLE TO AN INSTANT STOP MEANS A LOT OF PRACTICE. TORCH GOT HIS START IN 2009 WHEN HE LEARNED HOW TO USE BASIC FIRE PERFORMING EQUIPMENT FROM A FIRE-EATING GO-GO DANCER AT A DALLAS NIGHTCLUB, WHERE HE WORKED. AFTER A FEW 10- AND 15-MINUTE TEACHING SESSIONS, HE BOUGHT HIS OWN EQUIPMENT AND PERFORMED A COUPLE TIMES A NIGHT SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK. HE STARTED TOURING IN 2012 AND ENJOYS STAYING ON THE ROAD. IT KEEPS HIM CLOSE TO NATURE, GIVES HIM A WAY TO SEE THE COUNTRY AND INTRODUCES HIM TO WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A STELLAR GROUP OF PEOPLE. "ABOVE ALL, I'M A BIKER," HE SAYS ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE. "I LOVE MY BIKER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND WHAT WE REPRESENT, WHICH IS GREAT CAUSES." IT INFLUENCES THE VENUES HE PICKS FOR PERFORMANCE, WHICH INCLUDE PLENTY OF BIKER RALLIES. "YOU BECOME FAMILY WITH A LOT OF [PEOPLE] AT THESE RALLIES," HE SAYS. "BIKERS ARE A CLOSE KNIT GROUP OF PEOPLE. A LOT GOES INTO THESE RALLIES [INCLUDING] A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE."

127	MY OWN NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING BLOG POST/ARTICLE: "EASIER" IS THE WORD SHE IS CONTEMPLATING HERE. DOES LOSING A CHILD OR A MUCH WANTED PREGNANCY GET EASIER? I AGREE WITH "NO". IT GETS BEARABLE. THAT IS THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE ALMOST 4 YEARS OUT. THE DEFINITION OF BEARABLE IS: ABLE TO BE ENDURED, TOLERABLE. IT DIDN'T USED TO FEEL BEARABLE. I WOULD SAY THE GRIEF BECAME BEARABLE SOMETIME BETWEEN YEAR 1 AND 2. BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALL ACTIVE GRIEF. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS I WAS UTTERLY LOST AND CONSUMED BY THE LOSS OF MICHAEL AND ALENA - HAPPINESS FELT PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE. AT 3-6 MONTHS I WAS GETTING INTO THE TERRITORY OF WANTING HAPPINESS AGAIN; OF WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HEAVIEST KIND OF GRIEF WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND I BEGAN FEELING THE NEED TO PARENT MY LOST BABIES THROUGH ACTS. FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR, I WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO HEAL AND FIND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY. GRIEF AT THIS STAGE WAS CONSUMING, BUT NOT ALL-CONSUMING. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS A "NORMAL" PERSON AT ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME. AT THIS POINT IN MY JOURNEY AS A BEREAVED MOTHER, I WOULD SAY MOST WOULD CONSIDER ME A NORMAL, HAPPY, FUNCTIONING MOTHER/WIFE/WOMAN ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. MEANING, I GET ON WITH LIFE, TRYING TO ENJOY EVERYTHING I CAN, WHILE HONORING MY BABIES AND GIVING IN TO THE GRIEF WHEN NECESSARY. THINGS ARE BEARABLE. I'LL NEVER BE AT 100% AGAIN - THERE IS TOO MUCH SCARRING. BUT I WORK EVERY DAY TO GET JUST ONE MORE PERCENT HEALED. MY SKIN IS THICKER AND FOR 11 MONTHS OF THE 12 PER YEAR, I AM SMILING AND ABLE TO GET ON WITH IT. THAT SINGLE MONTH IS VERY NEAR. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BODY...THE NEARING OF OCTOBER. I CAN FEEL THEIR BIRTHDAY APPROACHING; CAN ALMOST HEAR IT, TOUCH IT, SMELL IT. THE LEAVES BEGINNING TO TURN AND THE COOL MORNINGS ARE INDICATORS THAT THE MONTH OF MEMORIES SWIMS NEARER TO ME. I WELCOME THE MEMORIES OF THE TWO BEINGS I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING UP TILL THAT POINT, BUT ALSO SHRINK BACK IN PAIN. THIS WILL BE THE MONTH (ALSO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS), THAT I HAVE TO RELIVE MY KIDS DYING. IT'S THE MONTH I HAVE TO REMEMBER GIVING BIRTH, WHILE TEARS OF HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FALL DOWN MY FACE. IT'S FREAKING PAINFUL. BUT, IT'S BEARABLE. AND I WILL GET THROUGH IT JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, KEEP READING. I LOVED THE WAY THIS WRITER EXPRESSED LIFE AS A BEREAVED PARENT. *COPIED FROM STILL STANDING MAGAZINE* A QUESTION IM FREQUENTLY ASKED BY BEREAVED PARENTS IS, DOES ITEVERGET EASIER? THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES IS PALPABLE. I KNOW. I GET IT. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION STILL SCARES ME TOO BECAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EASIER FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT. AND IT WASNT LONG AGO THAT I WAS ASKING BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WERE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF GRIEF THAN I WAS THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. IM NOT SURE WHEN I STOPPED ASKING IT PROBABLY WHEN I REALIZED IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN. STRADDLING HEAVEN AND EARTH ISNT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE ASEASY. EASIERIS A TRICKY WORD WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING AS PERMANENTLY HORRIFIC AS CHILD LOSS. I LIKE TO RESERVE THE WORDEASIERFOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING A NEW SKILL OVER TIME. EASIER IS A NICE LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEMEASURED.ITS ALSO A LOVELY LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT ARENT IRRETRIEVABLY LOST AND PERMANENTLY MISSING. FOREVER AND EVER. IM CERTAIN THE PROGRESS OF MOVING THROUGH THE UNCHARTED WATERS OF GRIEF AFTER THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS IMMEASURABLE. ITS ONE STEP FORWARD, FOUR STEPS BACK. ITS TREADING WATER, WITH YOUR HEAD SLIGHTLY ABOVE, UNTIL YOURE NOT. ITS SWIMMING ALONG, THEN DROWNING WITHOUT NOTICE. ITS NOT LINEAR. I WILL REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT GRIEF. WHETHER IN A DAY, A YEAR, OR A LIFETIME GRIEF ISNOTLINEAR. EVEN STILL, SEVEN YEARS LATER, I THINK IM SAILING ALONGOK,THEN ALL OF A SUDDENSMACKOUT OF NOWHERE GRIEF BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. SOMETIMES IT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF A STRATEGICALLY PLACED GORGEOUS NINE YEAR OLD, BLUE-EYED LITTLE BOY WHO SHOULD BE MY LIVING BREATHING OLDEST SON, BUT WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER MOTHER WHO IS CALLING AFTER HIM; SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM THE MISSING PUZZLE PIECE OF MY HEART THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF MY SON THAT STARTS OOZING UNCONTROLLABLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND TEARS LEAK OUT OF MY EYES WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. SOMETIMES ITS THE SIMPLE, ALMOST-PERFECT MOMENTS WITH MY 2/3RDS CHILDREN, THAT SMACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD AND ROB MY LUNGS OF PROPER BREATH. BREATHE,I GASP.BREATHE. THE THING ABOUT LIFE AFTER LOSS IS THAT NO MATTER WHATSOMEONE IS ALWAYS MISSING.NO MATTER WHAT, MY FAMILY IS ALWAYS ACHINGLYINCOMPLETE.I COULD HAVE FOUR MORE CHILDREN, AND THESE FACTS WOULD STILL REMAIN, STARING ME DOWN LIKE A CRUEL BULLY WHO WILL TORMENT ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT BACK. THE REALITY OF CHILD LOSS IS THAT THE WRONG CAN NEVER BE MADE RIGHT. IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED. EVER. LIFE IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN WITHOUT OUR LIVING, BREATHING CHILD(REN) IN IT. LIFE WILL NEVER FEEL A-OKAY AGAIN. SURE IT WILL HAVE MOMENTS OF BITTERSWEET JOY, AND BITTERSWEET HAPPINESS, AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LAUGH AGAIN, AND FIND STUPID THINGS FUNNY, BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE WHAT ITONCE WAS. THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THAT TWITTERPATED FEELING OF HAPPINESS THE KIND THAT FEELS NAIVE NOW, THE KIND YOU WONDER IF EVER EXISTED AT ALL? YOU MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. YOU CANT FIX IT, MEND IT, OR EVEN CRY IT AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS GO BY,THE ACHE REMAINS. SO BACK TOTHEQUESTION DOES IT EVER GET EASIER? THE HARD TRUTH IS A RESOUNDINGNO. NOT FOR ME, ANYWAY. IT HASNT GOTTENEASIERTO LIVE WITHOUT A HUGE PIECE OF MY HEART. GRIEF IS ALWAYS THERE, LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WALK THIS EARTH WITHOUT MY SON. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO BREATHE WHILE CHOKING ON AIR. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE NORMAL ANSWERS TO NORMAL QUESTIONS ANYMORE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS LIVING IN THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, SOUND LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OF GRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN HARD. WHETHER YOURE A DAY IN, OR 20 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO HARD. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD, OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION. SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD. AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE CAN HONOR OUR PRECIOUS CHILD WITH EVERY BREATH WE TAKE. WE CAN AND WILL BE HAPPY AGAINANDIM GUESSING IT WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS FEEL DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT OUR CHILD. WE LIVEANDWE GRIEVE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER, IT JUST BECOMESDIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT CALL THAT PESSIMISM, BUT FOR ME, ITSTRUTH. ITS SIMPLY THE REALITY OF BEREAVED PARENTHOOD. NOTE: GRIEF IS AS UNIQUE AS EACH PERSONS FINGERPRINT. IVE MET PLENTY OF BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WOULD SAY A RESOUNDING YES, GRIEF DOES GET EASIER OVER TIME. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR THEM. EASIER JUST ISNT THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. EACH PERSONS EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT. NO TWO PEOPLE GRIEVE THE SAME. AND OUR JOB IS TO MEET EVERYONES EXPERIENCE/REALITY WITH UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT AND LOVE.

128	( FAMILY FEATURES ) A BEAUTIFUL LAWN CAN BE THE FOUNDATION TO A HAPPY, HEALTHIER LIFE AND LEAD TO SPENDING MORE TIME OUTDOORS. IN FACT, 86 PERCENT OF AMERICANS CONSIDER THEIR LAWN IMPORTANT TO THEIR HOME AND LIFE. A HEALTHY LAWN ENCOURAGES YOU TO LIVE LIFE OUTSIDE MORE WITH YOUR FAMILY, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, SAID DR. KIRK HURTO, CHIEF SCIENCE OFFICER, TRUGREEN. THERES NO TIME LIKE LATE SUMMER AND EARLY FALL TO START PREPARING YOUR YARD FOR THOSE SPRING AND SUMMERTIME OUTDOOR GATHERINGS. WHILE A RECENT SURVEY CONDUCTED BY TRUGREEN SHOWED THAT SEVEN OUT OF 10 AMERICANS BELIEVE THEMSELVES TO BE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THEIR YARD, THE LAWN CARE EXPERTS AT TRUGREEN OFFER THESE HELPFUL REMINDERS TO GET YOUR YARD READY FOR FALL: AERATING AERATION INVOLVES REMOVAL OF SOIL CORES TO IMPROVE WATER AND AIR MOVEMENT IN COMPACTED SOILS, AND AIDS IN PROMOTING DEEPER AND MORE ROOT GROWTH AND THATCH MANAGEMENT. LONG TERM, YOUR LAWN WILL RESPOND QUICKER TO FERTILIZER AND WATER RUNOFF WILL BE REDUCED WHEN IRRIGATING. OVERSEEDING WHEN IT COMES TO INCREASING LAWN THICKNESS AND HEALTH, OVERSEEDING CAN BE ESSENTIAL. IT CAN HELP DISCOURAGE FUTURE WEEDS WHILE ALSO AIDING RECOVERY FROM SUMMER HEAT, DISEASE AND INSECT ACTIVITY. SEEDING DURING LATE SUMMER OR EARLY FALL WILL GIVE GRASS THE MAXIMUM TIME TO DEVELOP A DEEP EXTENSIVE ROOT SYSTEM AND MATURE BEFORE THE ONSET OF WINTER STRESSES. AERATION IS RECOMMENDED WHEN OVERSEEDING TO GIVE SEEDS MORE SOIL CONTACT AND PROVIDE A MOIST, PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT REQUIRED FOR GERMINATION. FEEDING FALL FEEDING GIVES YOUR LANDSCAPE THE NUTRIENTS NEEDED TO PREPARE FOR A HEALTHY, GREEN SPRING REVIVAL. HIRING A TRAINED SPECIALIST WITH A PLAN CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR REGION WILL HELP TREES AND SHRUBS THRIVE. IF YOU FERTILIZE YOUR OWN LAWN, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE PRODUCT DIRECTIONS AND SWEEP ALL FERTILIZER THAT MAY REACH PAVEMENT BACK ONTO YOUR LAWN. MAINTAINING HEALTH AND APPEARANCE THROUGHOUT THE FALL, THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAINTAIN YOUR YARDS APPEARANCE AND HEALTH, REMOVE FALLEN TREE LEAVES AND DEBRIS FROM YOUR LAWN. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN MULCHING TREE LEAVES BACK INTO YOUR LAWN EFFECTIVELY CLEARS AWAY TREE LEAF DEBRIS THAT OTHERWISE CAN BECOME MATTED AND DAMAGE YOUR LAWN OVER THE WINTER. LOWERING THE MOWER HEIGHT BY ONE OR TWO SETTINGS THE LAST COUPLE MOWINGS BEFORE WINTER REDUCES GRASS DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH SNOW.  CLEAN AND EDGE LANDSCAPE BEDS, LEAVING NO MORE THAN 2-3 INCHES OF MULCH IN THE BEDS. PRUNING PRUNING IS AN ESSENTIAL MAINTENANCE PRACTICE FOR TREES AND SHRUBS. LANDSCAPES CAN QUICKLY BECOME OVERGROWN IF NOT CARED FOR, BUT YEARLY PRUNING WILL MAINTAIN TREES AND SHRUBS TO AN IDEAL SIZE AND SHAPE. REMOVE DEAD OR DAMAGED BRANCHES FROM TREES AND SHRUBS TO PREVENT ROT ORGANISMS FROM INVADING THE TRUNK AND STEMS OF PLANTS. FOR MORE FALL LAWN CARE AND MAINTENANCE ADVICE, VISIT TRUGREEN.COM .

129	MY GOAL IN WRITING THIS ARTICLE IS TO UNRAVEL SOME OF THE CONFUSION ABOUT THESE THREE DOCUMENTS. IT IS HARD ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THESE DOCUMENTS MEAN IN MASSACHUSETTS, BUT THEN WE HAVE NEIGHBORING STATES OR POPULAR SNOWBIRD DESTINATIONS WITH A DOCUMENT CALLED DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE. GOOD HEAVENS, WHAT IS THAT? IS IT A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY OR A HEALTH CARE PROXY OR BOTH? FIRST, LETS JUST SAY THAT THE DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY IN MASSACHUSETTS IS A DOCUMENT SOLELY FOR MANAGING THE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS OF ANOTHER PERSON AND HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE PRINCIPALS HEALTH, EXCEPT PAYING FOR IT, OF COURSE. THE HEALTH CARE PROXY IS THE ONLY LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENT IN MASSACHUSETTS FOR MAKING HEALTH CARE DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON (SEE MY PREVIOUS POST ON MOLST). IT IS RELATIVELY NEW, BEING CREATED BY STATUTE IN THE 1970S, SO I STILL SEE SOME CLIENTS WHO CREATED SOME TYPE OF LIVING WILL DOCUMENT EARLY IN THEIR ADULT LIVES AND NEVER UPGRADED TO A HEALTH CARE PROXY. BEFORE THE HEALTH CARE PROXY DOCUMENT, MANY PEOPLE HAD A LIVING WILL (ALSO KNOWN AS AN ADVANCE DIRECTIVE). THE OLD LIVING WILLS WERE VERY POPULAR IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY CONSISTED OF A LIST OF SCENARIOS AND YOU WOULD CHECK A BOX FOR YES OR NO. THE SCENARIOS WERE COMPLICATED.IF YOU ARE IN A COMA AND YOU CAN NOT EAT ON YOUR OWN WOULD YOU WANT A FEEDING TUBE, YES OR NO? WELL.WHAT IS A COMA ANYWAY? MIGHT I COME OUT OF IT? CAN I SAY I WANT IT FOR TWO WEEKS AND THEN TAKE IT OUT IF I DONT RECOVER? A SIMPLE YES OR NO DID NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO EXPRESS THEIR END OF LIFE ISSUES. THE HEALTH CARE PROXY DOCUMENT DOES ONLY ONE THING: NAME A HEALTH CARE AGENT WHO CAN MAKE DECISIONS FOR YOU AT SUCH TIME AS YOU CAN NOT MAKE OR COMMUNICATE YOUR OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. THE IDEA BEHIND THE HEALTH CARE PROXY IS THAT THE HEALTH CARE AGENT KNOWS THE WISHES OF THE PRINCIPAL (MEANING, THE PERSON WHO HAS SIGNED THE HEALTH CARE PROXY DOCUMENT NAMING THE AGENT) AND CAN MAKE KNOWLEDGEABLE DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PRINCIPAL. WITH A HEALTH CARE PROXY, A DOCTOR DOES NOT NEED TO STUDY A DOCUMENT TO TRY AND DETERMINE WHICH ONE OF THE LITTLE BOXES ON THE FORM APPLIES IN THE CURRENT SITUATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PATIENT MAY HAVE CHECKED THE BOX FOR NO VENTILATOR OR INTUBATION. BUT THE DOCTOR FEELS AS IF A FEW DAYS ON A VENTILATOR WILL GIVE THE MEDICATION A CHANCE TO WORK AND THE PATIENT MAY VERY WELL RECOVER. WOULDNT THE PATIENT WANT TO TAKE THAT CHANCE? BUT UNFORTUNATELY, A CHECKMARK IN A LITTLE BOX CAN NOT CONVEY THOSE TYPES OF NUANCED DECISIONS. A PERSON, HOWEVER, CAN MAKE THOSE TYPES OF DECISIONS. A HEALTH CARE AGENT CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE DOCTOR AND MAKE A DECISION BASED ON THE FACTS AT HAND. A PERSON CAN LOOK AT ALL THE FACTS AND DECIDE THAT THE PATIENT PROBABLY WOULD WANT TO TRY THE VENTILATOR FOR A WEEK TO SEE IF HIS OR HER CONDITION IMPROVES, OR THAT THE PATIENT WOULD NOT WANT TO TRY THE VENTILATOR AND SHOULD BE TREATED WITH COMFORT CARE ONLY. SO HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM A LIVING WILL? THE LIVING WILL/ADVANCE DIRECTIVE IS NOT A LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENT IN MASSACHUSETTS. IT SERVES AS VALUABLE GUIDANCE FOR THE HEALTH CARE AGENT WHEN THE AGENT IS MAKING A DECISION. THERE ARE MANY GOOD LIVING WILL DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE SUCH AS THE FIVE WISHES AND WWW.HONORINGCHOICESMASS.COM . A REALLY GOOD LIVING WILL PROVIDES VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENTS WISHES AND CAN REALLY HELP THE HEALTH CARE PROXY MAKE DECISIONS. A DOCTOR IS UNLIKELY TO WANT TO EVEN LOOK AT A LIVING WILL UNLESS THE DOCTOR IS HELPING THE AGENT MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION. THIS IS BECAUSE A DOCTOR IS REQUIRED TO TAKE THE ACTION (OR INACTION) DIRECTED BY THE HEALTH CARE AGENT REGARDLESS OF THE WISHES EXPRESSED IN THE LIVING WILL . WHEN I AM GIVING SPEECHES, I OFTEN ASK THE AUDIENCE IF ANYONE SAW THE MOVIE THE DESCENDANTS WITH GEORGE CLOONEY. ITS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE, BY THE WAY. IT TAKES PLACE IN HAWAII AND GEORGE CLOONEYS WIFE IS IN A COMA AFTER AN ACCIDENT. AFTER A WEEK OR SO, THE DOCTOR COMES TO GEORGE AND SAYS HE IS REQUIRED TO TAKE THE WIFE OFF LIFE SUPPORT BECAUSE THE WIFE HAD A LIVING WILL. GEORGE, HOWEVER, IS NOT READY TO LET HER GO. THE DOCTOR EXPLAINS HE HAS NO CHOICE. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE LAW IN HAWAII, BUT IF THE MOVIE IS ACCURATE, HAWAII SEEMS TO HAVE A VALID AND BINDING LIVING WILL LAW WHICH REQUIRES A DOCTOR TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF THE WISHES OF THE FAMILY. IF GEORGE CLOONEY BEEN A MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENT, HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THE DECISION CONCERNING HIS WIFE RATHER THAN THE HOSPITAL MAKING THE DECISION. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT EVERY MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENT SHOULD HAVE A HEALTH CARE PROXY. IF YOU ARE A PART TIME RESIDENT OF FLORIDA AND YOU HAVE A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE BE AWARE THAT THE DOCUMENT WILL BE VERY CONFUSING TO MASSACHUSETTS PHYSICIANS. TRY TO OBTAIN AN APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE PROXY DOCUMENT FOR EVERY STATE IN WHICH YOU LIVE FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME DURING THE YEAR AND IN WHICH YOU RECEIVE HEALTHCARE.

131	BY SARAH KENT AND GEORGI KANTCHEV LONDON--EUROPE'S COMMODITIES TRADERS ARE WARNING THAT NEW REGULATIONS SET TO BE RELEASED WITHIN DAYS COULD ROIL MARKETS AND PUSH UP COSTS FOR A RANGE OF ESSENTIALS FROM CRUDE OIL TO CHOCOLATE. A FINAL DRAFT OF EXPANDED RULES GOVERNING THE EUROPEAN UNION'S OVERSIGHT OF FINANCIAL MARKETS IS EXPECTED TO EXTEND ITS AUTHORITY OVER FIRMS THAT FOCUS ON TRADING IN OIL, FARM PRODUCTS, INDUSTRIAL METALS LIKE COPPER AND A HOST OF OTHER COMMODITIES. IT WOULD ADD A NEW LAYER OF SCRUTINY FOR AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY OPERATED WITH LIMITED OVERSIGHT. THESE COMPANIES--LIKE BP PLC, GLENCORE PLC AND VITOL GROUP--BUY AND SELL HUGE VOLUMES OF OIL AND INDUSTRIAL METALS ON A DAILY BASIS, HEDGING THEIR STOCKS OF RAW MATERIALS WITH SIZABLE POSITIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY JUST HOW BIG THEY ARE, VITOL STUNNED MARKET WATCHERS IN 2008 WHEN REGULATORS DISCOVERED THAT AN INTERNAL HEDGE FUND REPRESENTED 11% OF OUTSTANDING OIL TRADES ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE. THE EU'S REGULATIONS ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF A REPEAT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND PREVENT MARKET ABUSE SUCH AS THE $2.6 BILLION LOSS IN THE COPPER MARKET ATTRIBUTED TO A TRADER AT JAPAN'S SUMITOMO IN THE 1990S. THE EU'S CURRENT RULES MOSTLY APPLY TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE BANKS AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. RIGHT NOW, BIG TRADERS LIKE GLENCORE, VITOL AND MERCURIA GROUP DON'T HAVE THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS BANKS TO SET ASIDE MONEY TO BACKSTOP THEIR TRADING AND LIMIT THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTS THEY TRADE IN A GIVEN TIME. THE NEW RULES ARE EXPECTED TO REQUIRE MORE OF THE TRADERS, THOUGH HOW MUCH REMAINS UNCLEAR. BIG COMMODITIES PLAYERS FROM ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC TO MARS CHOCOLATE TO TRAFIGURA BEHEER BV HAVE OBJECTED TO THE IDEA OF BEING TREATED ESSENTIALLY LIKE BANKS, LOBBYING BRUSSELS TO EXEMPT THEM FROM SOME OF THE RULES. THEY SAY THEY SHOULDN'T BE REGULATED AS CLOSELY BECAUSE A LARGE PART OF THEIR BUSINESS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS IS INTENDED TO LOWER THEIR RISK WHEN TRADING RAW MATERIALS. NEW RULES, THEY ARGUE, WOULD MAKE IT HARDER TO TRADE AND COULD CAUSE SOME TO LEAVE THE MARKET, MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR AIRLINES, UTILITIES AND OTHERS TO MANAGE THEIR EXPOSURE TO COMMODITIES PRICES--COSTS THAT ULTIMATELY WOULD BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS. "WE ARE UTTERLY IN FAVOR OF REGULATION, BUT WE DON'T WANT BAD OR OVER-REGULATED MARKETS THAT MAKE LIQUIDITY DRY UP," SAID GRAHAM FRANCIS, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT INTERDEALER BROKER ICAP ENERGY. "IF A BUNCH OF LIQUIDITY LEAVES, THEN WHAT? THINGS WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CONSUMERS...AND YOU'VE PROBABLY NOT IMPROVED MARKET STABILITY OR FUNCTIONALITY." THE EUROPEAN SECURITIES AND MARKETS AUTHORITY IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE TECHNICAL DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE REGULATIONS--KNOWN AS THE MARKETS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIRECTIVE, OR MIFID II--WILL BE APPLIED WITHIN DAYS. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, THE EU'S EXECUTIVE BRANCH, MUST THEN APPROVE OR REJECT THEM. REEMT SEIBEL, SPOKESMAN FOR THE SECURITIES AND MARKETS AUTHORITY, SAID THE AGENCY APPRECIATES THE CONCERNS RAISED BY BUSINESSES AND WOULD CONSIDER THEM. "IT IS NOT THE AIM OF ANY REGULATION TO KILL BUSINESS," HE SAID. TRADERS ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT WILL BE CAPTURED BY THE NEW RULES, THE VOLUMES THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TRADE AND WHETHER THEY WILL LEAVE BIG TRADERS SUBJECT TO HOLDING CAPITAL IN A SIMILAR WAY TO BANKS. "WE ARE NOT A BANK," SAID PATRICK POUYANN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FRENCH OIL GIANT TOTAL SA, WHICH HAS A LARGE TRADING ARM. HE ADDED IN A WEDNESDAY INTERVIEW: "I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED SOME REGULATIONS, BUT UP TO A POINT THAT LEAVES MARKETS TO WORK." SHELL HAS WARNED THAT IT COULD HAVE TO COMMIT UP TO $30 BILLION IN REGULATORY CAPITAL IF THE RULES ARE ENFORCED AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED. THAT COULD PROMPT THE COMPANY TO RESTRUCTURE OR MOVE PART OF ITS TRADING ARM TO A COUNTRY WITH LESS ONEROUS RULES. THE RULES ARE BEING PROPOSED AT A DIFFICULT MOMENT FOR ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TRADERS, GLENCORE. THE COMPANY HAS LOST MORE THAN 60% OF ITS STOCK VALUE THIS YEAR AS INVESTORS WORRY ABOUT ITS DEBT LEVELS AND CREDIT RATINGS AMID A COMMODITY PRICE SLUMP WITH NO END IN SIGHT. GLENCORE AND OTHERS WOULD HAVE AT LEAST 15 MONTHS TO PREPARE AND RESTRUCTURE THEIR BUSINESSES BEFORE THE RULES WENT INTO EFFECT. THE COMPANY REMAINS RELAXED ABOUT THE NEW RULES, ONE PERSON FAMILIAR WITH ITS THINKING SAID. IF NEEDED, IT COULD SIMPLY MOVE ITS TRADING OPERATIONS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. MANY OF WALL STREET'S BIGGEST FIRMS HAVE THEMSELVES DRAMATICALLY SCALED BACK THEIR COMMODITIES TRADING OR EXITED THE BUSINESS ALTOGETHER BECAUSE OF TOUGH REGULATIONS ALREADY IN PLACE. SOME OBSERVERS SAID TRADERS ARE BEING HYPERBOLIC AND THE REGULATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE BIGGEST AMERICAN OIL COMPANIES SUCH AS EXXON MOBIL CORP. AND CHEVRON CORP. HAVEN'T BEEN AS VOCAL IN OPPOSITION TO THE NEW RULES. THEY FOCUS THEIR TRADING AROUND SELLING THE CRUDE THEY PRODUCE. MAJOR EUROPEAN OIL COMPANIES HAVE LARGE TRADING ARMS THAT BUY AND SELL ADDITIONAL VOLUMES THEY DIDN'T PRODUCE. "THIS IS THE MINIMUM SET OF REQUIREMENTS THAT IS INDISPENSABLE," SAID DIEGO VALIANTE, HEAD OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS UNIT AT THE CENTRE FOR EUROPEAN POLICY STUDIES AND AN ADVISER TO ESMA. ACCORDING TO MR. VALIANTE'S CALCULATIONS, THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL EVEN THE LARGEST TRADING HOUSES WOULD NEED TO HOLD WOULD ONLY BE IN THE ORDER OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS--A LARGE, BUT AFFORDABLE FIGURE. "I DISAGREE THAT IT WILL CREATE A BIG MARKET DISRUPTION," HE SAID. THE EU'S LATEST REGULATORY PUSH WAS CONCEIVED IN THE WAKE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, AMID HEIGHTENED CONCERNS OVER SYSTEMIC RISKS IN THE MARKET AND THE ROLE SPECULATORS PLAY IN PUSHING UP PRICES FOR VITAL RAW MATERIALS LIKE OIL AND AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES. THE U.S. IS ALSO IN THE MIDST OF ITS OWN REGULATORY CRACKDOWN, LAUNCHED BY THE 2010 DODD-FRANK LAW, BUT MANY VIEW THE PROPOSED EUROPEAN REGIME AS LIKELY TO BE MORE STRINGENT. IN A SIGN OF THE IMPACT THE RULES COULD HAVE ON FINANCIAL MARKETS, GERMANY, FRANCE AND THE U.K. IN AUGUST EXPRESSED CONCERNS OVER SOME OF THE DETAILS AND CALLED ON REGULATORS TO MODIFY SOME ASPECTS.

AFTER POSTING THE 16TH-FASTEST LAP, RESPECTIVELY, IN BOTH NCWTS PRACTICE SESSIONS SATURDAY, YOUNG CONTINUED HIS CONSISTENCY BY QUALIFYING IN THE 16TH POSITION FOR SUNDAYS CHEVROLET SILVERADO 250. PLAYING THE PIT STRATEGY CARD EARLY ON, CREW CHIEF BRYAN BERRY CALLED THE 25-YEAR-OLD DRIVER TO THE ATTENTION OF HIS YOUNGS MOTORSPORTS TEAM FOR FOUR TIRES, FUEL AND AN AIR PRESSURE ADJUSTMENT, ON LAP 13, UNDER GREEN, TO AID IN A LOOSE HANDLING CHEVROLET SILVERADO. HOWEVER, JUST TWO LAPS LATER, YOUNG INFORMED THE TEAM THAT HE LOST SECOND GEAR, RESULTING IN THE TEXAS NATIVE LOSING VALUABLE TIME IN CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE 10-TURN ROAD COURSE. RUNNING WITHIN THE TOP-20 FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE CHEVROLET SILVERADO 250, YOUNG CAME DOWN PIT ROAD FOR THE FINAL TIME, ON LAP 45, FOR FOUR TIRES, AND FUEL, SETTING THE YOUNGS MOTORSPORTS DRIVER UP FOR THE FINAL 19-LAP SHOOTOUT. NURSING HIS TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE ENTIRETY OF THE 64-LAP EVENT, YOUNG EVENTUALLY CROSSED THE FINISH LINE IN THE 17TH POSITION BEHIND RACE WINNER, ERIK JONES. QUOTE: MY CHEVROLET SILVERADO WAS GOING TO BE REALLY GOOD TODAY, I THOUGHT. WE KNEW THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE A BUNCH OF CAUTIONS TOWARDS THE END OF THE RACE, SO MY PLAN WAS TO RIDE AROUND AND BE CONSERVATIVE, TO SAVE MY STUFF FOR THEN. I THOUGHT I WAS BEING EASY ON EVERYTHING, BUT SECOND GEAR ENDED UP BREAKING. IT WASNT A HUGE ISSUE, BUT IT DEFINITELY WAS NECESSARY FOR TRYING TO GET OFF TURN 5B. I LOST A LOT OF GROUND THERE EVERY LAP. OTHER THAN THAT, WE COULD RUN GUYS BACK DOWN THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE COURSE. MY GUYS WORKED REALLY HARD.

WEST COAST WILL HAVE ONE IF SAM BUTLER PLAYS. IT CAN BE TELLING. YOUR PLAYERS HAVE BEEN THERE, SEEN IT AND DONE IT. IT DOESNT GUARANTEE YOU A WIN, BUT YOUR PLAYERS HAVE SEEN THE PRESSURE COOKER BEFORE AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT DEALING WITH IT. THE LAST TIME THESE SIDES MET IN ROUND 19, HAWTHORN WON BY 14 POINTS, BUT PERHAPS MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THEY WON IN MOST OF THE KEY STATISTICAL INDICATORS HIT-OUTS 62-52, CLEARANCES 57-44, CENTRE CLEARANCES 15-6, STOPPAGES 42-38 AND CONTESTED POSSESSION 154-148. THE HAWKS ALSO LAID 101 TACKLES TO 68. THEY WERE SIGNIFICANT WINS IN IMPORTANT AREAS. BUT EAGLES RUCKMAN NIC NAITANUI DIDNT PLAY AND I WOULD RATE HIS FORM OVER THE LAST PART OF THE SEASON AS CLOSE TO THE BEST OF HIS CAREER. SO THE BIG QUESTION IS DOES NAITANUIS PRESENCE CORRELATE TO MORE HIT-OUTS, CLEARANCES AND INSIDE 50S TO THE EAGLES, AND MORE CHANCES FOR THEM TO WIN THE GAME? HAWTHORN ARE GOING TO NEED TO WIN THE BALL AT GROUND LEVEL IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO WINS THE HIT-OUT TO CANCEL OUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT NAITANUI WILL GET FIRST HANDS TO THE BALL. ONE OF WEST COASTS STRENGTHS THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THEIR DEFENSIVE PRESS, WHICH HAS HELPED THEIR SMALLER BACK LINE COPE IN THE ABSENCE OF ERIC MACKENZIE AND MITCH BROWN. TO EXPOSE THAT BACK LINE, THE HAWKS ARE GOING TO WANT TO MOVE THE BALL QUICKLY. BOTH MIDFIELDS HAVE BEEN PRETTY GOOD. ANDREW GAFF, LUKE SHUEY AND MATT PRIDDIS HAVE BEEN WEST COASTS MAINSTAYS AND THEY WILL PIT THEIR SKILLS AGAINST SAM MITCHELL AND JORDAN LEWIS, WITH LUKE HODGE AND SHAUN BURGOYNE PINCH-HITTING. VIDEO ROOS FEEL THE PRESSURE AHEAD OF AFL CLASH THE OTHER IMPORTANT PLAYER HAWTHORN MAY PUT THROUGH THE MIDDLE IS LIAM SHIELS, WHO OFTEN GETS A JOB RUNNING WITH ONE OF THE OPPOSITIONS KEY MIDFIELDERS. BOTH FORWARD LINES ARE POWERFUL, BOTH DEFENCES ARE VERY EFFECTIVE. THE HAWKS AVERAGE 111 POINTS FOR AND 70 AGAINST, MAKING THEM THE BEST ATTACK AND DEFENCE IN THE COMPETITION. WEST COAST AVERAGE 106 POINTS FOR AND 71 AGAINST, RANKING THEM SECOND AND THIRD. THE EAGLES HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC ALL YEAR AND I RECKON THEY HAVE SHOWN AN ABILITY TO STAND UP TO PRESSURE. BUT THEY ARE GOING AGAINST THE ELITE, A TEAM THAT HAS BEEN THIS COMPETITIONS BENCHMARK SINCE THE END OF THE 2011 SEASON. THE TRAVEL WONT BE AN ISSUE FOR HAWTHORN AND FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN MOST GAMES THIS YEAR, THE HUNGER IS STILL THERE.
134	SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THE 264-KM-ROUTE LAST YEAR, TRIALS ARE BEING HELD ON A DAILY BASIS, CONDUCTED BY ETIHAD RAILS OPERATING PARTNER, ERDB. FULL COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO START SHORTLY ONCE ETIHAD RAIL IS GRANTED ITS REGULATORY APPROVALS, THUS LEADING TO A SIGNIFICANT JUMP IN THE VOLUME OF SULPHUR TRANSPORTED BY RAIL IN 2016 AND BEYOND, SAID A SENIOR OFFICIAL. TRANSPORTING OVER TWO MILLION TONNES OF SULPHUR IN THE PAST YEAR DURING OUR TESTING AND COMMISSIONING AND TRIAL OPERATIONS PHASES IS A VERY PROUD ACHIEVEMENT FOR ETIHAD RAIL, OUR OPERATING PARTNER, ERDB, AND THE UAE AS A WHOLE, AS IT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES OUR UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION AS A RELIABLE, SAFE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MODE OF TRANSPORT, REMARKED ITS CEO FARIS SAIF AL MAZROUEI. OUR SUCCESS TO DATE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT OF OUR CUSTOMER AND PARTNER, ADNOC, HE STATED. TODAYS ANNOUNCEMENT OFFERS AN INSIGHT INTO THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THAT THE FEDERAL RAILWAY NETWORK WILL BRING TO THE UAE, WITH ETIHAD RAILS TRAINS HAVING ALREADY REPLACED MORE THAN 66,000 TRUCK TRIPS FROM THE ROADS IN THE WESTERN REGION OF ABU DHABI IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, SAID THE COMPANY IN ITS STATEMENT. THE ETIHAD RAIL PROJECT IS BEING DELIVERED IN THREE KEY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. IT WILL BE USED TO TRANSPORT BULK AND NON-BULK MATERIALS, OFFERING TAILOR-MADE SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERING CUSTOMER NEEDS. NETWORK ROUTES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE ALL KEY CUSTOMER SECTORS, WITH FREIGHT FACILITIES POSITIONED TO CONNECT PRODUCTION HUBS WITH POINTS OF IMPORT AND EXPORT, SAID THE STATEMENT. ETIHAD RAIL SAID ITS FLEET COMPRISES SEVEN LOCOMOTIVES AND 240 HOPPER WAGONS AND OPERATES TO TRANSPORT GRANULATED SULPHUR FROM TWO PLANTS IN SHAH AND HABSHAN IN THE WESTERN REGION OF ABU DHABI TO ITS TERMINAL AT RUWAIS PORT. ONCE COMPLETED, THE ETIHAD RAIL NETWORK WILL SPAN APPROXIMATELY 1,200 KM ACROSS THE UAE, CONNECTING URBAN AND PERIPHERAL COMMUNITIES, FACILITATING TRADE, OPENING UP COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND FOSTERING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, STATED AL MAZROUEI. IT WILL ALSO FORM A VITAL PART OF THE GCC RAILWAY NETWORK, LINKING THE UAE TO SAUDI ARABIA THROUGH GHWEIFAT IN THE WEST AND OMAN THROUGH AL AIN IN THE EAST, NOTED THE OFFICIAL. GOING FORWARD, WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THIS SUCCESS AS WE MOVE TOWARDS OUR TARGET OF TRANSPORTING MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION TONNES OF SULPHUR EVERY YEAR ONCE WE ENTER INTO FULL COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, HE ADDED.
135	12TH SEPTEMBER 2015 IF WE DID ALL THE THINGS WE WERE CAPABLE OF DOING, WE WOULD LITERALLY ASTONISH OURSELVES WELL THANK YOU RAIN, BEEN AWAKE SINCE EXACTLY 3.33AM, GOOD JOB I WENT TO BED EARLY OR I'D BE REALLY TIRED RIGHT NOW, INSTEAD I'M GOOD AND RARING TO GO. I HAD THE BEST DAY YESTERDAY TOO WHICH HELPS. HAD SOME MUCH ENJOYED ME TIME, AS MY BESTIE COULDN'T MAKE IT, I WAS GONNA DO THE HOUSEWORK THEN I THOUGHT NOPE, IT'S SUNNY, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN AND I FANCY ME A WALK AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I HAD. A COUPLE OF HOURS, ENJOYING THE SCENERY AND THE PEACE AND QUIET ON CANNOCK CHASE, NO 3G SIGNAL ON MY PHONE SO COMPLETE DISCONNECTEDNESS. I DO LOVE THE CHASE AND THE HEATHER LOOKS STUNNING AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, PLUS IT HELPED ME EARN 7 ACTIVITY PROPOINTS, BONUS! I THEN HAD ME AN HOUR ROUND THE SHOPS BEFORE GOING FOR MY MASSAGE, FINISHED MY DAY OFF BY COOKING MYSELF A DELICIOUS TEA, STEAK AND SPAGHETTI, IT WORKS AND WAS DELICIOUS. I WAS GOING TO GARDEN TODAY BUT WITH THE RAIN THAT'S GOING ON AT THE MOMENT, I DON'T THINK I WILL BE, INSTEAD I'LL SPEND SOME TIME IN THE KITCHEN I THINK POSSIBLY OR CHILLING WITH MY MOM, WHO KNOWS I MAY CONSIDER THE HOUSEWORK, I KEEP PUTTING THAT OFF. WHAT'S STOPPING ME? PROCRASTINATION IF I'M HONEST, PLAN OLD PUTTING IT OFF, I JUST FIND IT A LITTLE TEDIOUS, ACTUALLY A BIT OVERWHELMING, I KNOW IT'S A BIG JOB AND IT'S JUST GETTING STARTED THAT SUCKS, ONCE I'M INTO IT, I ACTUALLY START TO ENJOY IT AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE RESULTS. MMM AM I TALKING ABOUT MY HOUSEWORK THERE OR HOW SO MANY OF US FEEL ABOUT SORTING OUR EATING HABITS OUT AND TACKLING OUR WEIGHT! SO LET'S CHANGE THIS NOW TO WEIGHT, BECAUSE I'D BE AVOIDING THE ISSUE IF I PRETENDED PEOPLE DON'T DISAPPEAR FROM MEETINGS IN THE SUMMER, THEY DO. WE'RE MORE SIMILAR THAN WE CARE TO ADMIT, THEN ONCE THE KIDS GO BACK TO SCHOOL OR WE'VE HAD OUR HOLIDAYS WE PUT OFF RETURNING TO OUR MEETING, THEN WE REALISE CHRISTMAS IS ON THE WAY AND WE FINALLY GET BACK ON IT. SO WHAT'S STOPPING YOU? BECAUSE LET'S BE HONEST, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT TO MAKE HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHANGES AND IT'S ALL TOO EASY TO PUT IT OFF. HERE'S A THOUGHT, BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE PUTTING IT OFF IS JUST DOWN TO LACK OF MOTIVATION OR LAZINESS, DID YOU KNOW THAT PROCRASTINATION CAN SOMETIMES BE A SIGN OF LOW SELF-ESTEEM! YOU'RE DELAYING STARTING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SUBCONSCIOUS FEAR THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO FAIL, IS THAT WHAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK? WELL GO TELL YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS TO DO ONE BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO SUCCEED, MAKE REALISTIC CHANGES AND TWEAKS, GET YOURSELF THE SUPPORT YOU NEED AND YOU WILL DO THIS. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE HOUSEWORK, BEFORE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE SUCH HARD WORK AND UNENJOYABLE, WELL WE CAN FEEL LIKE THAT ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS, BUT ONCE WE SEE THOSE RESULTS AND REALISE WE CAN HAVE FUN, EAT DELICIOUS FOOD AND STILL LOSE WEIGHT, WE WONDER WHY WE EVER PUT OFF STARTING. BREAK IT DOWN, SET YOURSELF SMALL GOALS, YES WE ALL HAVE AN OVERALL TARGET, BUT BY SETTING MINI WEIGHT LOSS GOALS, IT'LL KEEP YOU GOING WEEK BY WEEK. THEN THERE'S THE PLATEAU, WE ALL HIT THEM, ONCE THE HONEYMOON PERIOD OF WEIGHT LOSS JOURNEY WEARS OFF, YOU KNOW THAT FIRST FEW WEEKS OF WOO HOO GREAT WEIGHT LOSS, ONCVE IT SLOWS DOWN AND PEOPLE STOP NOTICING, WE CAN START TO FORGET WHY WE STARTED, THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO SIT DOWN AND MAKE A LIST OF WHY YOU STARTED, WHAT'S IMPROVED IN YOUR LIFE SINCE YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT AND HOW IT'S GOING TO CARRY ON GETTING BETTER. AND DON'T GIVE ME THE "I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT THIS WEEK" LINE, I USE THAT TOO OFTEN MYSELF. I KNOW MOST OF THE TIME WE HAVE A TO DO LIST LONGER THAN OUR ARM, AND THE THOUGHT OF ADDING TO IT MAKES US SHUDDER. BUT REALLY ISN'T PRIORITISING OUR WELLBEING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD, BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DO THAT, ONE DAY WE'LL GET SICK AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. ROUTINE HELPS HERE, GET INTO THE HABIT OF SPENDING 15 MINUTES PLANNING YOUR MEALS FOR THE WEEK, OR ALLOCATE 20 MINUTES A DAY TO HAVING A WALK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE TO DO WALKING SO IT'S THE QUICKEST AND EASIEST ACTIVITY, JUST POP ON YOUR TRAINERS AND WALK FROM WHERE YOU ARE. COOKING FROM SCRATCH DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TIME CONSUMING, MY TEA TOOK 15 MINUTES YESTERDAY AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE THE SPAGHETTI TAKES 11 MINUTES TO COOK AS I USED FROZEN VEGETABLES FOR QUICKNESS SO NO CHOPPING. SO COME ON NO MORE EXCUSES, ACKNOWLEDGE YOU'RE PUTTING IT OFF AND HONESTLY ANSWER THE QUESTION "WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?" THEN REALISE IT'S AN EXCUSE AND GET STARTED, IF YOU'RE ALREADY DOING IT, GO YOU! I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING MY BEYOUTIFUL MEMBERS THIS MORNING, THEY'RE DOING IT, THEY REALISE IT WORKS AND THEY'RE ENJOYING THE JOURNEY. HERE'S TO A GREAT WEEKEND - YOU IN? AND YES I AM GOING TO TACKLE THE HOUSEWORK, I'VE TALKED MYSELF ROUND!

137	ARCHIVE. ELIZABETHTON (WJHL) THOUGH HES NO LONGER IN THE CLASSROOM, A FORMER TRI-CITIES EDUCATOR CONTINUES TO TEACH LESSONS TO THOUSANDS.  IN MAY, DR.  ALSO, EACH SYNTAX-CASE CLAUSE HAS A PATTERN AND EXPR, INSTEAD OF A PATTERN AND TEMPLATE. JOSH WANDELL STEPPED LDOWN AS ELIZABETHTONS EAST SIDE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPAL. TWO YEARS PRIOR, HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LOU GEHRIGS, ALSO KNOWN AS ALS . SATURDAY, COMMUNITY MEMBERS HELD THE THIRD ANNUAL RACE FOR WANDELL. WE ALL DO OUR PART TO EMBRACE FAITH OVER FEAR, SAID THE MC. ITS A SAYING THIS CARTER COUNTY COMMUNITY GRASPED ONTO. WANDELLS BROTHER, NEAL, SAID, HES A LIVING EXAMPLE HIS FAITH IS 10 TIMES MORE THAN HIS FEARS. ITS SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD VERY EASILY GIVE UP, BUT HES A VERY STRONG INDIVIDUAL. HES NOT WILLING TO LET THIS DISEASE OVERCOME HIM, SAID WANDELLS PHYSICAL THERAPIST MICHAEL LOWE. FAMILY MEMBERS SAY WANDELLS FAITH OVER FEAR IS STRONGER THAN EVER. YOU DONT THINK ABOUT HIM BEING SICK, BECAUSE HELL TALK TO YOU. WE YALK ABOUT SPORTS, WERE TALKING ABOUT FANTASY FOOTBALL, NEAL SAID. WHILE THE DISEASE STEALS THE ABILITY TO MOVE, COMMUNITY MEMBERS IMPACTED BY WANDELLS FIGHT MOVED FOR HIM.  THE BUILDING IS REPLACING A KROGER GROCERY STORE AND STRIP MALL ON DECKER BOULEVARD AND O'NEIL COURT. TO HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY COME OUT AND BE WILLING TO WALK, AND DO THIS WALK FOR JOSH IS AMAZING, LOWE TOLD NEWS CHANNEL 11. FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW, A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WALKED OR RAN THREE MILES AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WANDELL WAS ONCE A PRINCIPAL AT. I JUST WANTED TO SHOW HIM THAT I LOVE HIM AND HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE HIM, SO I RAN THAT RACE TODAY TO SHOW HIM THAT, SAID EAST SIDE ELEMENTARY STUDENT OLIVIA HOLLI. EACH STEP RAISES AWARENESS ABOUT THE INCURABLE DISEASE. LESS THAN 200,00 PEOPLE HAVE IT IN THE UNITED STATES, NEAL SAID. ITS ALMOST UNDER-FUNDED, LACK OF RESEARCH.  THE EVEN ALSO RAISES FAITH.

138	NEW IPAD HAS 12.9-INCH SCREEN SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMONEY) - TIM COOK HAS UNVEILED THE NEW IPAD PRO AND APPLE WATCHES AT SAN FRANCISCO'S BILL GRAHAM CIVIC AUDITORIUM FOR ANOTHER ONE OF APPLE'S PATENTED PRESS EVENTS. IPAD PRO AS EXPECTED, APPLE IS MAKING A BIGGER, FASTER IPAD. THE IPAD PRO IS 12.9 INCHES. IT'S THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE IPAD AIR, SO YOU CAN RUN IPAD AIR APPS SIDE BY SIDE. THE SCREEN HAS 5.6 MILLION PIXELS -- MORE THAN A 15-INCH MACBOOK PRO WITH A RETINA DISPLAY. THE IPAD PRO STARTS AT $799. INSIDE IT'S MUCH FASTER. THE IPAD PRO HAS A NEW A9X 64-BIT CHIP. IT'S 1.8 TIMES FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS IPAD'S CPU ("DESKTOP CLASS" ACCORDING TO APPLE EXECUTIVE PHIL SCHILLER). IT IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO EDIT THREE STREAMS OF 4K VIDEO AT A TIME. IT HAS A 10-HOUR BATTERY LIFE, IS SUPER THIN, WEIGHS JUST OVER 1.5 LBS. "WHY MAKE AN IPAD WITH A BIGGER DISPLAY?" ASKED SCHILLER. GOOD QUESTION! GAMES AND MOVIES LOOK BETTER ON A BIGGER SCREEN, HE SAID. IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE A FULL-SIZE KEYBOARD ON THE SCREEN. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TYPE ON THE SCREEN, APPLE HAS MADE A NEW SMART KEYBOARD THAT DOUBLES AS A COVER, MICROSOFT SURFACE-STYLE. THE KEYBOARD IS COATED WITH A THIN FABRIC. THE COMPANY IS ALSO MAKING ITS OWN STYLUS, BUT WITH THE USUAL OVER-THE-TOP DESIGN AND MARKETING. YES, IT'S THE APPLE PENCIL, A LOW LATENCY STYLUS THAT FEELS LIKE A REAL PENCIL. IT EVEN GOT ITS OWN JONY IVE NARRATED VIDEOS. IT "FEELS LIKE A TRUE WRITING OR DRAWING INSTRUMENT," SAID IVE. AS THE NAME IMPLIES, THE IPAD PRO'S REAL TARGET AUDIENCE IS BUSINESS USERS. TO SHOW THAT IT'S SERIOUS, APPLE BROUGHT OUT A VERY UNEXPECTED PARTNER TO DEMO THE IPAD PRO: MICROSOFT'S KIRK KONENIGSBAUER. HE DEMONSTRATED MICROSOFT OFFICE FOR IPAD PRO USING THE APPLE PENCIL. ADOBE ALSO DEMOED ITS IPAD PRO APPS INCLUDING A NEW PRODUCT CALLED PHOTOSHOP FIX, A RETOUCHING TOOL. USING THE IPAD PRO AND NEW STYLUS, ADOBE'S ERIC SNOWDEN DID SOME REALTIME EDITS INCLUDING THE ODD CHOICE OF CHANGING A PHOTO OF A MODEL TO MAKE HER SMILE MORE. (IT WAS THE FIRST WOMAN ON STAGE DURING THE PRESENTATION.) FOR THE FINAL DEMO, IRENE WALSH FROM 3D4MEDICAL SHOWED OFF HER STARTUPS 3D MEDICAL APP THAT SHOWS 3D INTERACTIVE ANATOMY IMAGES FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS AND PATIENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED A NEW IPAD MINI 4. APPLE TV APPLE ALSO UNVEILED A NEW APPLE TV POWERED BY SIRI AND NEW TOUCH-ENABLED REMOTE. IT WILL ALSO GIVE DEVELOPERS THE ABILITY TO CREATE APPS FOR THE NEW APPLE TV. TIM COOK CALLED IT 'THE FUTURE OF TELEVISION." APPLE WATCH THE COMPANY KICKED OFF THE EVENT WITH AN UPDATE ABOUT THE APPLE WATCH. FASHIONISTA'S NOW HAVE MORE BAND OPTIONS. THE BIGGEST ADDITION IS A WRAP-AROUND BROWN LEATHER HERMS BAND, WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE IN OCTOBER. THE WATCH ITSELF NOW COMES IN GOLD AND ROSE GOLD, AND THERE ARE NEW SPORTS BANDS OPTIONS AS WELL. THE SMART DEVICE WAS RELEASED IN APRIL. THERE ARE NOW MORE THAN 10,000 WATCH APPS, INCLUDING A FEW NEW IMPORTANT ADDITIONS. FACEBOOK MESSENGER'S APP WILL LET YOU SEND TEXT, AUDIO AND LOCATION MESSAGES. GOPRO'S APP ACTS AS A VIEWFINDER FOR YOUR CAMERA. ITRANSLATE LETS YOU SPEAK A WORD AND GET A TRANSLATION AND AIRSTRIP IS A TOOK FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. IT'S ALSO ADDING TRANSIT DIRECTIONS TO THE INCLUDED MAPS APP. THE COMPANY IS ALSO DUE TO UPDATE ITS IPHONE LINE. ONE OF THE MORE INTRIGUING RUMORS IS THAT APPLE IS WORKING ON A LARGER VERSION OF ITS IPAD TO APPEAL TO PROFESSIONALS AND BUSINESSES. WHEN IT COMES TO THESE EVENTS, APPLE IS A WELL-OILED MACHINE. LED BY TIM COOK, A ROSTER OF APPLE EXECS AND SOME SPECIAL GUESTS WILL TAKE THE STAGE TO UNVEIL THE LATEST PRODUCTS. A SIMILAR PRODUCTION HAPPENS EVERY FALL, GIVING THE COMPANY A NICE LEAD TIME BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS TO BUILD ANTICIPATION FOR NEW PRODUCTS. WANT TO KNOW WHAT MIND-BLOWING OR HO-HUM PRODUCTS APPLE IS RELEASING NEXT? CHECK BACK HERE DURING THE EVENT AND FOLLOW US ON TWITTER @CNNMONEY. WE'LL UPDATE THIS ARTICLE WITH NEWS, PHOTOS AND DETAILS ABOUT THE NEW PRODUCTS AS THEY'RE ANNOUNCED. CHECK OUT OUR LATEST APPLE COVERAGE WHILE YOU WAIT.
139	FROM A NOTORIOUS CON MAN TO CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES, THIS GRAND HOME -- NAY, THIS GRAND COMPOUND -- IN THE HEART OF THE LOS FELIZ NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES HAS HOUSED QUITE A CAST OF CHARACTERS OVER THE YEARS. WITH 14 BEDROOMS AND EIGHT BATHROOMS, IT'S RICH WITH HISTORY AND BRIMMING WITH POSSIBILITIES. BUILT IN 1929 BY ARCHITECT HARLEY S. BRADLEY FOR A MAN NAMED RUDOLPH ROSENBERG , IT WAS SOLD THE SAME YEAR TO MUSIC STORE MAGNATE BEN PLATT . OVER THE YEARS, PLATT HIRED ARCHITECTS PAUL R. WILLIAMS AND ALBERT E. HANSEN , TO EXPAND IT, ADDING A POOL, TENNIS COURTS, AND ANOTHER STORY TO BRING IT TO ITS CURRENT 10,000-SQUARE-FOOT MEASUREMENT. THE NEXT OWNER WAS A NOTORIOUS CON MAN NAMED C.C. JULIAN , WHOM LISTING AGENT DAVID SOLOMON DESCRIBES AS THE BERNIE MADOFF OF HIS DAY. AFTER HIS COMPANY, THE JULIAN PETROLEUM CORP., WAS FOUND TO HAVE SWINDLED MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE OUT OF $150 MILLION, JULIAN COMMITTED SUICIDE (NOT IN THIS HOME) IN 1934. IN THE LATE 1950S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OWNER TOOK OVER: THE SAINT COLUMBAN'S FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY, A GROUP OF CATHOLIC MISSIONARY PRIESTS WHO STILL LIVE THERE TODAY. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES MADE TO THE HOME OVER THE YEARS (SPACES WERE DIVIDED TO CREATE ADDITIONAL ROOMS TO HOUSE PRIESTS), SOLOMON SAYS THE HOME RETAINS MANY OF ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES, INCLUDING CARVED FIREPLACES AND DETAILED WOODWORK. THE MOST NOTEWORTHY HISTORIC FEATURE IS A CAVE THAT LEADS TO A HIDDEN WINE CELLAR TO A FULL SPEAK-EASY USED DURING PROHIBITION. THERE ARE ALSO QUARTERS FOR LIVE-IN STAFF. SOLOMON SAYS IT WILL TAKE THE RIGHT BUYER TO BRING THE HOME TO PRESENT-DAY STANDARDS, BUT THE RETURN COULD BE HUGE. CURRENTLY LISTED FOR $5,499,000, THE PROPERTY COULD BE VALUED AT OVER $12 MILLION POSTRENOVATION BASED ON ITS SIZE, HISTORY, AND LOCATION. "WHEN IT'S REDONE, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES IN LOS ANGELES," HE SAYS. ALTHOUGH THE HOME IS SET BACK FROM THE ROAD, IT FEATURES AMAZING CITY VIEWS AND IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HOLLYWOOD'S GREEK THEATRE AND GRIFFITH PARK. AS FOR THE NEIGHBORS, THINK HOLLYWOOD STARS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOME BEHIND THIS PROPERTY USED TO BE ROBERT PATTINSON 'S LOVE NEST WITH THEN-GIRLFRIEND KRISTEN STEWART . THE "TWILIGHT" STAR SOLD THE HOME IN 2014, AND NOW JIM PARSONS OF "THE BIG BANG THEORY" LIVES THERE. SO WHO'LL BE NEXT TO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THIS HISTORIC HOME? SOLOMON SAYS WHILE IT COULD BE ANYONE FROM A SINGLE FAMILY TO A PRODUCTION COMPANY, THE LUCKY OWNER WILL DEFINITELY POSSESS ONE QUALITY. "THE RIGHT BUYER WILL BE SOMEONE WHO HAS AN APPRECIATION FOR THE TYPE OF HOME THEY JUST DON'T BUILD ANYMORE," HE SAID. "THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS."
140	IN 2014, NATIONAL COUNCIL ON ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCE OF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, INC. (NCADD OF MIDDLESEX), INC. INITIATED QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH EFFORTS TO EXAMINE CURRENT AWARENESS AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE AGENCYS BRAND IDENTITY; POTENTIAL BARRIERS WITH THE BRAND NAME; AND, WHAT THE AGENCY NEEDED TO IMPROVE ITS BRAND IDENTITY TO ONE THAT MORE CLOSELY RESONATES WITH ITS TARGET AUDIENCES AS WELL AS CURRENT AND FUTURE EFFORTS THE AGENCY IMPLEMENTS. WE LEARNED THAT: THE NCADD NAME CREATES CONFUSION AS TO WHETHER THE ORGANIZATION IS NATIONAL OR LIMITED TO MIDDLESEX COUNTY; ONE OF NCADDS PRIMARY FUNCTIONS IS PREVENTION, WHICH IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE NAME; AND, THE NCADD LOGO IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AGENCY AND WHAT IT DOES. THE RESULT OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS IS OUR NEW NAME, THE WELLNESS CENTER FOR PREVENTION, SAID BOARD OF TRUSTEES PRESIDENT JEFF JANNARONE. NOW, ADDED JANNARONE, OUR NEW TAGLINE REPRESENTS THE AGENCYS COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING HEALTHY LIVING THROUGH EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND ADVOCACY. THE WORD WELLSPRING IT IS A REAL WORD, BUT IT PLAYS OFF WELLNESS (PREVENTION) AND SOURCE (RESOURCE AND THE SOURCE OF THE BEST INFORMATION) WE PROVIDE THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, NOTED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR EZRA HELFAND. OUR NEW NAME INVOKES A BOTTOM-UP ORGANIC APPROACH. WELLSPRING REPRESENTS THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT SOME BIG, IMPERSONAL INSTITUTION. WE COME FROM A LOCAL PLACE AND DEVELOP IDEAS, SERVICES, AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE THEN SCALABLE TO WIDER AUDIENCES, BUT ARE GROUNDED IN THE WORK WE DO IN COMMUNITIES. HELFAND SAID THAT WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES. WE CHANGE PEOPLES LIVES THROUGH PREVENTION EDUCATION AND POSITIVE COMMUNITY CHANGE. SINCE 1980, NCADD/WELLSPRING HAS BEEN PROVIDING A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES THAT FEATURE: AN EVER-EXPANDING ARRAY OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT COURSES FOR ADDICTION COUNSELORS, PREVENTION SPECIALISTS, SCHOOL FACULTY, AND SCHOOL STAFF. EDUCATIONAL SERVICES (TO SCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITY) AND SUPPORT TO THOSE WHO NEED ASSISTANCE CONFRONTING THE DISEASE OF ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCE IN THE FORM OF INFORMATION, GUIDANCE, OR REFERRAL. SERVICES FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND THE WELLBEING OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. FAR FROM TELLING YOUTH TO JUST SAY NO, WE PLEDGE TO ONLY PROVIDE SERVICES THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE CHANGE BEHAVIOR FOR THE BETTER. EFFORTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE, ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUTH. WE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASED COLLABORATION AND PLANNING COORDINATION, AND SHARING OF RESOURCES, THEREBY MAXIMIZING THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS OF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, AND BEYOND. THE COALITION FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES IS WHERE WE BRING TOGETHER PROFESSIONALS FROM MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES THAT HAVE A PASSION FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND OTHER SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR NEW COMPANY NAME, CONCLUDED HELFAND. WE BELIEVE THE NAME WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION ALLOWS US TO BETTER REPRESENT WHO WE ARE AND WILL ENABLE US TO OFFER AND INTRODUCE NEW SERVICES. CHANGING OUR NAME TO WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION FINALIZES AN ONGOING SHIFT IN CORPORATE STRATEGY THAT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, ADDED JANNARONE. WHILE WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN WHAT WEVE ACCOMPLISHED TO-DATE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND INNOVATE. THE NEW NAME IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, AND WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE AGENCYS PRODUCT AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE CALENDAR YEAR 2015 AND THROUGH EARLY 2016.

145	SOLSTICE EAST UTILIZES PSYCHOTHERAPY TO HELP STRUGGLING TEEN GIRLS DISCOVER THEIR FULL POTENTIAL THERAPIST AT SOLSTICE EAST HELPS STUDENT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT OUR GIRLS TO DO THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE ITS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WE WANT THEM TO LEARN HOW TO REGULATE THEIR THOUGHTS, FEELINGS," SAYS KYLE GILLETT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND FOUNDING PARTNER OF SOLSTICE EAST. SOLSTICE EAST, LEADING RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT CENTER FOR TEEN GIRLS AGES 14-18, OBSERVES NATIONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY DAY ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2015 BY ENCOURAGING EVERYONE TO SEEK EMOTIONAL HEALING. SOLSTICE EAST RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA SO OFTEN ATTACHED WITH PSYCHOTHERAPY AND MENTAL HEALTH. WITH A THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM SPECIALIZING IN TREATING A WIDE ARRAY OF ISSUES SUCH AS TRAUMA, LOSS, AND ATTACHMENT AND THE OFTEN-ACCOMPANYING ADDICTIVE PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR AND THOUGHT, SOLSTICE EAST HAS HELPED HUNDREDS OF TEEN GIRLS ALONG A JOURNEY TOWARDS SUCCESS AND HAPPINESS. AS A PREMIER RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT CENTER, SOLSTICE EAST HAS A DIVERSE GROUP OF TALENTED CLINICIANS WHO UTILIZE PSYCHOTHERAPY TO CONNECT, ENGAGE AND EMPOWER TEEN GIRLS. CLINICIANS AT SOLSTICE EAST UTILIZE THE FOLLOWING FORMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY TO TREAT TEENS: EMDR: (EYE MOVEMENT DESENSITIZATION AND REPROCESSING) IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED TECHNIQUE USED TO TREAT TRAUMA AND ANXIETY. THIS FORM OF PSYCHOTHERAPY HELPS DAMPEN THE POWER OF EMOTIONALLY-CHARGED MEMORIES OF PAST TRAUMATIC EVENTS, SAYS DAN HADLEY, M.S., LMFT, DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL SERVICES AT SOLSTICE EAST. TF-CBT: (TRAUMA FOCUSED COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY) PROVIDES PSYCHOEDUCATION ON TRAUMA AND HOW IT IMPACTS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL HEALTH. CLIENTS CREATE A NARRATIVE OF THEIR TRAUMA AND ARE THEN ABLE TO PROCESS AND REWRITE THE STORY IN A WAY THAT EMPOWERS THEM. IT ALSO FOCUSES ON LEARNING TO HAVE HEALTHY, SAFE RELATIONSHIPS, SAYS HADLEY. TF-EAP: (TRAUMA FOCUSED EQUINE ASSISTED PSYCHOTHERAPY) IS ONE OF THE MOST-USED FORMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY AT SOLSTICE EAST. HORSES ARE USED TO HELP CLIENTS SEE HOW THEY BEHAVE AND ARE RESPONDED TO IN RELATIONSHIPS. CLIENTS ALSO LEARN ASSERTIVENESS AND SELF-REGULATION SKILLS. THIS IS A POWERFUL FORM OF PSYCHOTHERAPY BECAUSE HORSES PROVIDE IMMEDIATE NON-JUDGMENTAL FEEDBACK ABOUT HOW THEY ARE SHOWING UP AND THE GIRLS CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND SEE THE POSITIVE IMPACTS QUICKLY, SAYS GEORGIA DEFRANCIA, MSW, LCSW, ASSISTANT CLINICAL DIRECTOR AND EQUINE DIRECTOR AT SOLSTICE EAST. DBT: (DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR THERAPY) IS INTEGRATED INTO SOLSTICE EASTS CLINICAL PROGRAM. DIALECTICAL BEHAVIORAL THERAPY EMPHASIZES ACCEPTING UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGHTS, FEELINGS AND BEHAVIORS INSTEAD OF STRUGGLING WITH THEM. THIS HELPS OUR GIRLS LEARN EMOTION REGULATION AND HOW TO HAVE HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEMSELVES AND OTHERS, SAYS DEFRANCIA. OTHER FORMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY USED INCLUDE CBT (COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY), SOMATIC EXPERIENCING, SOLUTION FOCUSED THERAPY, AS WELL AS ADVENTURE-BASED THERAPY AND MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING. THE SOLSTICE EAST APPROACH FOCUSES ON TREATING THE WHOLE PERSON, NOT JUST THE IDENTIFIED PROBLEM OR PROBLEM BEHAVIOR. IT ISNT FOCUSED ON SYMPTOM REDUCTION, BUT ON GETTING TO THE CORE OF THE ISSUES, AND BUILDING A STRONG FOUNDATION. SOLSTICE STRIVES TO USE ALL FORMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY REQUIRED TO HELP THE INDIVIDUAL HEAL. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE WANT OUR GIRLS TO DO THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE ITS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, SAYS KYLE GILLETT, PH.D, LMFT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND FOUNDING PARTNER OF SOLSTICE EAST.

146	U.S. SPACE AGENCY NASA ANNOUNCED ON MONDAY IT HAS FOUND "STRONG" EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS LIQUID WATER INTERMITTENTLY FLOWING ON PRESENT-DAY MARS. IMAGES TAKEN FROM THE MARS ORBIT SHOWED DARK, FINGER-LIKE MARKINGS THAT, TYPICALLY LESS THAN FIVE METERS IN WIDTH, APPEAR ON SLOPES DURING WARM SEASONS, LENGTHEN AND THEN FADE DURING COOLER SEASONS ON THE RED PLANET. THESE SURFACE FEATURES, KNOWN AS RECURRING SLOPE LINEAE (RSL), HAVE BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO FORM BY THE ACTIVITY OF BRINES, BUT DIRECT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN LACKING. NOW, USING AN IMAGING SPECTROMETER FROM NASA'S MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO), RESEARCHERS DETECTED SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED MINERALS ON SLOPES WHERE THE MYSTERIOUS STREAKS ARE SEEN ON MARS. "OUR QUEST ON MARS HAS BEEN TO 'FOLLOW THE WATER,' IN OUR SEARCH FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, AND NOW WE HAVE CONVINCING SCIENCE THAT VALIDATES WHAT WE'VE LONG SUSPECTED," SAID JOHN GRUNSFELD, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR OF NASA'S SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE IN WASHINGTON. "THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT, AS IT APPEARS TO CONFIRM THAT WATER -- ALBEIT BRINY -- IS FLOWING TODAY ON THE SURFACE OF MARS." THESE PUZZLING SURFACE FEATURES WERE FIRST NOTICED IN 2010 BY LUJENDRA OJHA, THEN A UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT, USING IMAGES FROM THE MRO'S HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING SCIENCE EXPERIMENT. IN THE NEW STUDY, OJHA, NOW A GRADUATE STUDENT AT GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, AND HIS COLLEAGUES ANALYZED SPECTRA DATA FROM THE COMPACT RECONNAISSANCE IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM) ABOARD THE MRO FROM FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHERE THE RSL FEATURES WERE PRESENT. THEY REPORTED IN THE BRITISH JOURNAL NATURE GEOSCIENCE THAT SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED SALTS AT THESE RSL LOCATIONS EXISTED ONLY WHEN THE DARK FEATURES WERE RELATIVELY WIDE. "WE FOUND THE HYDRATED SALTS ONLY WHEN THE SEASONAL FEATURES WERE WIDEST, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT EITHER THE DARK STREAKS THEMSELVES OR A PROCESS THAT FORMS THEM IS THE SOURCE OF THE HYDRATION," OJHA SAID. "IN EITHER CASE, THE DETECTION OF HYDRATED SALTS ON THESE SLOPES MEANS THAT WATER PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THESE STREAKS." THE RESEARCHERS INTERPRETED THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES AS CAUSED BY HYDRATED MINERALS CALLED PERCHLORATES, WHICH ARE LIKELY A MIXTURE OF MAGNESIUM PERCHLORATE, MAGNESIUM CHLORATE AND SODIUM PERCHLORATE. SOME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO KEEP LIQUIDS FROM FREEZING EVEN WHEN CONDITIONS ARE AS COLD AS MINUS 94 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT (MINUS 70 CELSIUS), NASA SAID. ON EARTH, NATURALLY PRODUCED PERCHLORATES ARE CONCENTRATED IN DESERTS, AND SOME TYPES OF PERCHLORATES CAN BE USED AS ROCKET PROPELLANT. PERCHLORATES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN ON MARS. FOR EXAMPLE, NASA'S PHOENIX LANDER AND CURIOSITY ROVER BOTH FOUND THEM IN THE PLANET'S SOIL, AND SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THAT THE VIKING MISSIONS IN THE 1970S MEASURED SIGNATURES OF THESE SALTS. "HOWEVER, THIS STUDY OF RSL DETECTED PERCHLORATES, NOW IN HYDRATED FORM, IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAN THOSE EXPLORED BY THE LANDERS," NASA SAID. "THIS ALSO IS THE FIRST TIME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM ORBIT." FOR OJHA, THE NEW FINDINGS ARE MORE PROOF THAT THE MYSTERIOUS LINES HE FIRST SAW DARKENING MARTIAN SLOPES FIVE YEARS AGO ARE, INDEED, PRESENT-DAY WATER. "WHEN MOST PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WATER ON MARS, THEY'RE USUALLY TALKING ABOUT ANCIENT WATER OR FROZEN WATER," HE SAID. "NOW WE KNOW THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY. THIS IS THE FIRST SPECTRAL DETECTION THAT UNAMBIGUOUSLY SUPPORTS OUR LIQUID WATER-FORMATION HYPOTHESES FOR RSL."

148	POPULAR POSTS: RECENT POSTS: STOCKS HAVE TUMBLED SINCE LAST WEEKS FEDERAL RESERVE MEETING, WITH THE BENCHMARK S&P 500 INDEX SKIDDING ANOTHER 24 POINTS (1.2%) ON TUESDAY, AND LOSING GROUND THROUGH MID-DAY WEDNESDAY. IS THAT SO BAD? NOT NECESSARILY. IN A RECENT PRESENTATION, I WENT INTO SOME DETAIL ABOUT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE MARKETS DEEP AUGUST DIVE. I NOTED THAT THE 14-DAY RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX PLUMMETED TO 16.8% ON AUGUST 25. SINCE 1950, THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY 17 UNIQUE INSTANCES (NOT COUNTING REPEAT OCCURRENCES IN THE SAME CALENDAR YEAR) WHERE THE RSI FELL BELOW 20%. IN EACH OF THE PREVIOUS 16 CASES, THE S&P 500 INDEX WENT ON TO BREAK AT LEAST MARGINALLY ITS CLOSING LOW RECORDED ON THE DAY OF THE RSI LOW. SO THE ODDS, BASED ON HISTORY, ARE OVERWHELMING THAT, SOONER OR LATER, THE S&P WILL TEST ITS AUGUST 25 CLOSING LOW AT 1867.62. BUT HERES THE POTENTIAL GOOD NEWS. WHEN THE TEST OCCURS FAIRLY SOON (WITHIN, SAY, EIGHT WEEKS) AFTER THE INITIAL LOW, THE MARKET TYPICALLY PERFORMS A LOT BETTER IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS AND MONTHS THAN IF THE TEST IS DEFERRED. THUS, IF YOURE ROOTING (AS I AM) FOR WALL STREETS GREAT BULL RUN TO CONTINUE INTO 2016, YOU WANT TO GET THE TEST OVER AND DONE WITH SOON . SPECIFICALLY, YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MARKET GO BACK TO PROBE ITS AUGUST LOWS BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER. EVERY DOWN DAY TAKES US CLOSER TO COMPLETING THAT TASK. OF COURSE, DOWN DAYS ARE ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY UNPLEASANT HEADLINES. THATS THE NATURE OF THE BEAST, AS SEASONED INVESTORS UNDERSTAND. CHEERFUL NEWS REPORTS DONT PUSH STOCKS DOWN! IN AUGUST, IT WAS THE COMMODITY ROUT (OIL IN PARTICULAR) THAT DROVE THE SELLING. NOW ITS HILLARYS LATEST VENTURE INTO PHARMACEUTICAL PRICE CONTROLS, PLUS A NICE DASH OF UNCERTAINTY INTRODUCED BY VOLKSWAGENS ( VLKAY ) MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR EMISSIONS SCANDAL. IF WE TUNE OUT THE SCREECHES AND SQUAWKS OF CNBC, THOUGH, WE CAN OBSERVE THAT THE MARKET IS RETREATING IN A MUCH MORE ORDERLY FASHION THAN IT DID IN AUGUST. FAR FEWER INDIVIDUAL STOCKS ARE SCRAPING NEW 52-WEEK LOWS. TRADERS ARE BUILDING A MUCH SMALLER PANIC PREMIUM ( VIX ) INTO OPTIONS PRICES, VERSUS THE AUGUST PEAK. (SEE CHART .) THESE ARE THE FIRST HINTS THAT THE UPCOMING TEST, WHEN IT OCCURS, WILL PROVE SUCCESSFULIN THE SENSE THAT A STRONG Q4 RALLY WILL FOLLOW FOR THE HEADLINE U.S. EQUITY INDEXES. ONE OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE SECTORS RIGHT NOW, THANKS TO A SIZABLE PRICE DROP IN RECENT WEEKS, IS HEALTHCARE. HOW FICKLE WALL STREETS MOODS ARE! JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, THE STREETS BIG, BRAVE BLUSTERERS WERE BARKING AT YOU TO BUY HEALTHCARE AND ESPECIALLY THE HIGH-FLYING BIOTECHS BECAUSE THE AGING OF THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLDS POPULATION SUPPOSEDLY GUARANTEED FAT PROFITS. NOW ALL THOSE WINDBAGS ARE COWERING IN THEIR CORNERS, TERRIFIED THAT SOMEONE WITH AN EGO TO MATCH THEIR OWN IS STRUTTING ACROSS THE NATIONAL STAGE. BUT THE POLITICAL STARS ARE ALIGNED QUITE A BIT DIFFERENTLY TODAY THAN IN 2008. EVEN IF MRS. CLINTON IS ELECTED NEXT YEAR, SHELL HAVE FAR LESS SUPPORT IN CONGRESS FOR HER HEALTHCARE PROPOSALS THAN MR. OBAMA DID FOR HIS IN 2009-10. IN SHORT, I SUSPECT THAT THE RECENT SELLOFF IN PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER HEALTHCARE STOCKS GREATLY OVERSTATES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE CLINTON GOUGING MANIFESTO (OR ANYTHING LIKE IT) WILL GET ENACTED.

153	STOCKS OF MAKERS OF BIOLOGIC AND "SPECIALTY" DRUGS PLUNGED MONDAY AFTER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE'LL SOON RELEASE A PLAN TO ADDRESS "PRICE GOUGING" IN THE INDUSTRY. IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST DAYS OF THE YEAR FOR THE STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE OF THE BIOTECH INDUSTRY. CLINTON'S ANNOUNCEMENT ON TWITTER FOLLOWED NEWS THAT DRUGMAKER TURING PHARMACEUTICALS IN AUGUST HIKED THE PRICE OF DARAPRIM, A 53-YEAR-OLD DRUG FOR TOXOPLASMOSIS, A POTENTIALLY DEADLY PARASITIC INFECTION, TO $750 PER PILL FROM $13.50. THE TOP 20 DRUGMAKERS WHOSE PRODUCTS INCLUDE BIOLOGIC OR SPECIALTY DRUGS POSTED SHARE DROPS OF MORE THAN 2 PERCENT. THE NASDAQ BIOTECHNOLOGY INDEX DROPPED 4.4 PERCENT. BIOLOGIC DRUGS ARE PRODUCED IN LIVING CELLS, AND SPECIALTY DRUGS TREAT COMPLEX, CHRONIC CONDITIONS. THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. MANY NEW DRUGS FOR CANCER, HEPATITIS C, RARE DISORDERS AND EVEN A NEW CLASS OF CHOLESTEROL DRUGS HAVE PRICES IN THE RANGE OF $80,000 OR MORE FOR A YEAR OR A COURSE OF TREATMENT. SOME ARE MAJOR MEDICAL ADVANCES, SAVING LIVES AND OTHER MEDICAL COSTS. OTHERS ARE MINOR IMPROVEMENTS, SUCH AS CANCER DRUGS THAT ADD A FEW MONTHS OF SURVIVAL OVER EXISTING MEDICINES. SO WHILE THE TURING PRICE HIKE WAS GETTING THE BLAME MONDAY FOR THE STOCK SLUMP, IT'S ONLY THE LATEST ALTHOUGH PERHAPS MOST OUTRAGEOUS EXAMPLE OF PRICE HIKES OR SKY-HIGH PRICES FOR NEWLY LAUNCHED DRUGS. INSURANCE COMPANIES, POLITICIANS, ADVOCATES FOR PATIENTS AND OTHER CRITICS HAVE BEEN BLASTING THOSE PRICES AS OUTRAGEOUS AND UNSUSTAINABLE FOR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND PATIENTS PAYING UP TO 30 PERCENT OF THE COST. VERMONT SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, CLINTON'S CHIEF RIVAL FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION, HAS BEEN RAILING ABOUT HIGH DRUG PRICES FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND RECENTLY REINTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ENABLE THE MEDICAID PROGRAM TO GET LOWER PRICES FOR SOME DRUGS AND ALLOW U.S. RESIDENTS TO BUY CHEAPER DRUGS FROM CANADA. ALTHOUGH THEIR STOCK PRICES RARELY MOVE MORE THAN 1 PERCENT IN A DAY, THE TOP 20 DRUGMAKERS TOOK SIGNIFICANT HITS MONDAY.
154	THE CLINKING OF THE GLASSES ECHO THROUGH THE ROOM. THE ROLLS OF THE EYES ARE CLEARLY MADE FOR ALL TO SEE BUT THE KISS, THE KISS THAT WAS FORCED BY EVERYONE ELSE SURROUNDING THEM WAS PURE AND REAL. LOVE EXISTS BETWEEN THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL SOULS. A LOVE THAT COULD NOT BE DENIED, EVEN WITH THE ROLL OF THE EYE. AS THE CELEBRATION CARRIED ON THE STARS OF THE SHOW DECIDE THAT ENOUGH ATTENTION WAS POURED ONTO THEM AND IT WAS TIME TO REFLECT IT BACK TO THOSE WHO MATTERED MOST IN THEIR LIVES. THE PARENTS WHO NURTURED THESE TWO HEARTS TO ADULT HOOD AND HELPED SHAPE THEM INTO THE PEOPLE WHO STAND BEFORE US. THE GRANDPARENTS WHOSE SHOULDERS WERE A SAFE HAVEN TO CRY ON WITH NO JUDGEMENT LIVING AMONGST THIS RELATIONSHIP. ON AND ON, ONE BY ONE, YOU COULD PINPOINT THE SIGNIFICANCE EVERY HEART IN THE ROOM HAD ON THIS NEWLY FORMED FAMILY. I WATCHED AS THE NEWEST BRIDE AND GROOM DANCED THEIR FIRST DANCE. ONCE THE SONG CONCLUDED AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT ALL MARRIED COUPLES MUST REPORT TO THE DANCE FLOOR FOR A VERY SPECIAL TRIBUTE. AFTER A LITTLE COAXING, EVERYONE FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE DANCE FLOOR. MUSIC BEGAN AND THE DANCING STARTED. A FEW MOMENTS PASSED AND A REQUEST WAS MADE THAT EVERYONE MARRIED FOR LESS THAN A YEAR TO PLEASE EXIT THE FLOOR AND FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO THEIR TABLES. THE MUSIC CONTINUED TO PLAY AND SLOWLY WITH EACH NEW REQUEST FEWER COUPLES REMAINED. FINALLY ONE COUPLE WAS LEFT STANDING, HOLDING ON TO EACH OTHER AND GAZING INTO EACH OTHERS EYES. THEY NO LONGER RESEMBLED THE TWO YOUNG KIDS WHO WERE MARRIED AT EIGHTEEN. TIME HAD MARCHED ON AND AGING CREPT ITS WAY ACROSS THEIR YOUNG FACES. BODIES WERE WAR TORN FROM LONG AGO BATTLES AND CHILDREN BLESSED THEIR LIVES BUT TOOK A TOLL ON THEIR AGING HEARTS. THE FLUIDITY OF THE BOXTROT COULD NOT BE FOUND AND A GENTLE SWAY WAS WITNESSED AS THEY EACH SECRETLY HELD THE OTHER UP. EVEN AFTER ALL THE YEARS HAD PASSED THE FACES THEY GAZED UPON WERE THE MOST FAMILIAR OF ALL. EVERY WRINKLE THAT FOUND ITS HOME FOUND A PLACE IN THE OTHERS HEART. EVERY PART OF THEM HAD BEEN DETAILED IN A FINE MAP TUCKED IN THE RECESS OF THEIR MEMORIES.. HERE IS WHERE THEY WERE AND HERE IS WHERE THEY WOULD ALWAYS BE. THEY LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE AGE DOES NOT TOUCH THEIR LOVE. IT IS CEMENTED INTO THEIR HISTORY AND HAS BEEN THE FOUNDATION FOR THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES. RECENTLY MARRIED I AM INFANT IN THE MARRIAGE WORLD. WE CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THE NEWLYWED BLISS OF EVERYDAY LIFE. FIGHTS ERUPT BUT THE COMFORT OF KNOWING THE OTHER WILL ALWAYS BE THERE HAS GIVEN WAY TO NEW FORMS OF COMMUNICATION. EVERYDAY IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND ALSO CONTAINS SOME OF THE MOST REWARDING OF MOMENTS. IT IS A COMRADERY OF THE TWO OF US AGAINST THE WORLD WHICH RESULTS IN A FEELING OF BEING LARGER THAN LIFE ITSELF. IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYDAY LIFE WE SEARCHED AND FOUND A LIFE LONG COMPANION THAT NEVER LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF LOVE GIVEN IN A SINGLE MOMENT. LUPUS AND INFERTILITY DOES NOT HOLD BACK THIS LOVE BUT NURTURES IT AND TEACHES US PERSONAL HUMILITY, GRACE AND WONDER IN THE SIMPLE MOMENTS OF LIFE. I HAVE TAKEN AWAY IN THE BRIEF TIME I HAVE BEEN MARRIED A KNOWLEDGE THAT I ALWAYS KNEW BUT NEVER EXPERIENCED. LOVE IS AN EVER CHANGING HORIZON WE EACH LOOK OUT UPON IN OUR LIVES. CLOUDS ROLL IN, STORMS DROP RAIN AND AS THE SUN PEAKS BACK OUT ANOTHER LAYER HAS BEEN WASHED AWAY AND EXPOSED LEAVING A NEW LAYER OF LOVE TO BE NOURISHED. THIS NEW LAYER IS ENRICHED BY ITS SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT AND GROWS WILD UNDER THE SUN. TIME PASSES AND LAYER AFTER LAYER IS ADDED AND A TRUE LOVE STORY IS CREATED. ONE THAT IS CARRIED ON FOR GENERATIONS TO COME AND SETS AN EXAMPLE FOR ALL OF US TO DANCE TO. HTTP://WWW.FAIRHAVENHEALTH.COM/
155	THE BEST INDICATOR THAT THE NATIONAL RECESSION WAS LIFTING IN MEMPHIS WAS THE EMERGENCE THIS YEAR OF NUMEROUS PLANS FOR NEW HOTELS AND MOTELS. THE PLANNED $57 MILLION IN IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MEMPHIS COOK CONVENTION CENTER HAVE RESTARTED A DISCUSSION ABOUT LONGER-TERM PLANS FOR AN EXPANSION THAT COULD INCLUDE TWO NEW RIVERSIDE HOTELS. (FLEMING ARCHITECTS) BUT ASIDE FROM WHITEHAVENS 450-ROOM, $90 MILLION GUEST HOUSE AT GRACELAND, MOST OF THE PLANNED PROJECTS ARE SMALL. AND THE SMALLER HOTELS DO LITTLE TO RESOLVE THE LONG-STANDING CHICKEN-AND-EGG QUESTION ABOUT WHICH SHOULD COME FIRST MORE HOTEL ROOMS OR MORE AND BETTER CONVENTION SPACE. TO SAY THAT WE ARE DOMINATED BY SELECT-SERVICE, LIMITED-SERVICE SMALLER PROPERTIES IN THIS ENTIRE MARKETPLACE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT, MEMPHIS CONVENTION & VISITORS BUREAU PRESIDENT BEHIND THE HEADLINES, HOSTED BY THE DAILY NEWS PUBLISHER THE DOWNTOWN MEMPHIS COMMISSION IS EXPLORING NEW GUIDELINES THAT WOULD PUSH TAX INCENTIVES TO HOTELS THAT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON ATTRACTING LARGE CONVENTIONS AND MEETINGS TO THE CITY. THAT MEANS A DENSER DOWNTOWN. WERE REALIZING THAT WE NEED LARGER HOTELS THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE THESE CONVENTIONS COMING TO MEMPHIS, SAID LESLIE GOWER, THE DMCS MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS VICE PRESIDENT. SHE COUNTS 4,100 HOTEL ROOMS DOWNTOWN THAT IN 2013 GENERATED $250 MILLION IN REVENUE FOR THE CITY. WERE TRYING TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN IN A PARCEL. THATS OUR GOAL DENSITY, GOWER SAID, CITING THE $160 MILLION, TWO-TOWER ONE BEALE PROJECT. ITS 18-STORY TOWER OVERLOOKING RIVERSIDE DRIVE AND THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WILL FEATURE A 255-ROOM HOTEL: WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE ARE PROJECTS THAT BRING A LOT OF PEOPLE INTO TOWERS. KANES CITYWIDE PERSPECTIVE COUNTS 240 HOTELS IN ALL OF SHELBY COUNTY WITH 23,000 ROOMS, BUT ONLY 19 OF THOSE HOTELS HAVE 150 ROOMS OR MORE. ANOTHER FIVE HAVE AT LEAST 300 ROOMS AND THERE IS ONLY ONE HOTEL WITH MORE THAN 500 THE 603-ROOM SHERATON MEMPHIS DOWNTOWN THATS CONNECTED TO THE MEMPHIS COOK CONVENTION CENTER. I WOULD RATHER HAVE ONE, 500-ROOM PROPERTY THAN 10, 100-ROOM PROPERTIES, KANE SAID. USUALLY THE LARGER PROPERTIES HAVE LARGER SALES FORCES. THEY HAVE LOTS OF MEETING SPACE. THEY BRING BUSINESS TO THE MARKET VERSUS JUST SPREADING BUSINESS AROUND. ONE WAY TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE ROOM-COUNT DENSITY WOULD BE A WESTWARD EXPANSION OF THE EXISTING CONVENTION CENTER TOWARD THE MEMPHIS HARBOR AND MISSISSIPPI RIVER. WE HAVE THE FOOTPRINT THERE ON CITY-OWNED PROPERTY TO DO A MAJOR EXPANSION OF SOMETHING OF THE MAGNITUDE OF A MUSIC CITY CENTER IN NASHVILLE THAT WOULD BE CONNECTED TO OUR EXISTING CONVENTION CENTER, KANE SAID. AND ON THAT FOOTPRINT, WE HAVE ROOM FOR TWO LARGER HOTELS IF WE CAN FIND THE HOTEL PARTNERS. SUCH AN EXPANSION OVER AND UNDER EXISTING INTERSTATE RAMPS, WHICH WOULD ADD 2,000 RIVERFRONT HOTEL ROOMS, IS STILL TENTATIVE AND AT LEAST 10 YEARS IN THE FUTURE. ITS ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A SMALLER-SCALE RENOVATION STILL IN THE PLANNING STAGES. A HIKE IN THE LOCAL HOTEL-MOTEL BED TAX FINANCE WILL FINANCE MOST OF THAT $57 MILLION RENOVATION. IN 10 YEARS, 15 YEARS, THE WHOLE WORLD CHANGES, KANE SAID OF THE PLANS TO PUSH TO THE RIVERS EDGE. WE MAY DECIDE WE NEED A CONVENTION CENTER IN ANOTHER PART OF TOWN. BUT THE WILLINGNESS OF KANE AND OTHER CIVIC LEADERS TO UNVEIL THE $57 MILLION RENOVATION PROJECT, AS WELL AS A FUTURE GLIMPSE OF THE MUCH LARGER EXPANSION, REFLECTS A VIEW THAT STAYING PUT IS PREFERABLE TO RELOCATING. WE HAVE SAID IF WE CAN IMPROVE THIS CONVENTION CENTER AND MAKE IT VERY COMPETITIVE THE WAY IT IS NOW, IT WOULD BE MORE REASONABLE FOR US IN THE LONG TERM TO EXPAND WHERE WE ARE INSTEAD OF GOING TO A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LOCATION AND HAVING TO FIND A NEW USE LIKE WE DID AT THE PYRAMID.
156	THERE WAS AN INTERESTING EPISODE OF BETH AND DOG ON THE BIG HUNT (OR WHATEVER IT'S CALLED) WHERE THEY WERE HELPING THE USUAL CLUELESS HAPLESS CHEFTESTANTS, SEENWANDERING AROUND IN CIRCLES HAEMORRHAGING CASH MONEY BEFORE THE DOG TEAM CAME IN TO "FIX" THEM. ONE GUY IN THIS PARTICULAR CLOWN SHOE WEARER'S GALLERY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS A SPECIAL OLYMPIAN PAR EXCELLENCE BY SOMETHING HE SAID. HE WAS ONE OF THE AUXILIARY BUNGLERS ON A TEAM OF CLOWNFISH. STILL, WHEN HE WAS INTRODUCED TO DOG, HE BOLDLY SHOOK HIS HAND AND SAID WITH BLARING PRIDE, "THE NAME IS GUY CANTERO SENIOR, BAILBONDSMAN." WHO INTRODUCES THEMSELVES, WHO EVEN STYLES THEMSELVES, AS "SENIOR"? A SMALL MAN WITH A LARGE PROBLEM IT SEEMS! A MAN WITH A SON WITH THE SAME NAME AS HIM. IN OTHER WORDS, A MAN WITH A SWAGGERING EGO. PEEWITALSO HAD A GOATEE AND A PONYTAIL, WAS IN HIS LATE THIRTIES. HE LOOKED LIKE HE'D JUST WALKED OUT OF THE COMICS SHOP AFTER ACQUIRING A $3000 "STATUE" OF "NEIL GAIMAN'S ANGELA" ("MICHELANGELO'S DAVID"). DOG SAID, "GUY, NICE TO MEET YOU, HEARD ABOUT YOU." HE WAS PARING HIS NAILS AND SPITTING A PLUG OF TOBACCO WHEN HE SAID IT, BUT HE SAID IT.LATER OF COURSE DOG CALLED HIM SIMPLY "YOUR GUY," AND YOU COULD SEE THAT DUANE'S EASY, FREEWHEELING FORGETTING OF THE GUY'S NAME REALLY STUNG AND RANKLED OLD GUY CANTERO SENIOR. HE WAS REALLY MIFFED!! HE TURNED TO THE CAMERA AND SAID, "THAT ESPECIALLY HURTS MY FEELINGS BECAUSE MY NAME IS GUY GUY CANTERO, SENIOR AND DOG SORT-OF SEMI-FORGOT IT. WELL NO LET'S CALL A SPADE A SPADE, HE ACTUALLY A HUNDRED PER CENT FORGOT MY NAME! AND AS IT HAPPENS I AM VERY DEFENSIVE AND SENSITIVE ABOUT MY NAME, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT I POINTEDLY ADD THE NAME "SENIOR" TO IT WHEN I SAY IT. AND NOW HERE COMES DOG ACTING LIKE I'M NOT A BIG FUCKING DEAL AT ALL, LIKE I'M NOT WORTHY OF A NAME, LIKE I'VE BEEN KIDDING MYSELF ALL MY LIFE. AW GEEZ." THE CAMERA WAS NOT RUNNING AT THE TIME. DOG WAS IN L.A. THAT WEEK. HE TURNS UP AT THE HEIGHT OF NOON IN L.A. WEARING A FULL-LENGTH TRENCHCOAT. SWEAT MUCH?SHREWD THINKING BOUNTY-MAN. I'D LOVE TO SEE THE "GAG REEL" OF SOME OF THESE EPISODES DOG WILTING FROM THE HEAT, COLLAPSING IN THE STREET FROM HEAT SICKNESS, COUGHING UP HIS TUBERCULAR LUNGS, GRASPING MADLY FOR HIS INHALER.
157	KR: RIGHT, THE FETUS CONSTANTLY ADAPTS TO THE WOMB ENVIRONMENT AND PAYS THE PRICE FOR IT. THE FIRST ORDER IS SURVIVE AT ALL COSTS. THEN IF WERE FORTUNATE LATER, POSSIBLY THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO GO BACK AND TAKE CARE OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS, AND ALSO ITS THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO. NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL THEIR PAIN, NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL TERROR OR ANYTHING UNPLEASANT REALLY. THATS WHAT OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE ABOUT, DISTRACTING OURSELVES IN A THOUSAND WAYS FROM ALL THIS PAIN WERE CARRYING AROUND, WHICH KEEPS RELENTLESSLY SURGING TO BE MADE CONSCIOUS. DR. JANOV WRITES, THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA WHILE BEING CARRIED AND IN CHILDHOOD DIE IN AVERAGE TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THOSE RISK FACTORS. SO HERE THIS IS A GOOD ARGUMENT, FOR UNDERSTANDING AND RELIVING AND FEELING OUR PAIN, AND POSSIBLY EVEN HEALING BIG SECTIONS OF OUR HEARTS AND SOULS THAT ARE THERE WAS AN OLD BOOK THAT HE WROTE CALLED PRISONERS OF PAIN. THAT WERE ALL KIND OF HUGGED TIED BY OUR PAIN AND THE REPRESSION THAT WE USE TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT. JL: RIGHT, AND I THINK THIS CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF AFFECTS TOO IN TERMS OF HOW WE REPRESS OR HOW WE TRY TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE JUST AS BAD IF WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DIG PAST THE PAIN OR REPRESS IT THAT CREATES ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM, WHICH CAN THEN SHOW UP IN OTHER WAYS. THERE HASNT BEEN A LOT OF DEFINITIVE RESEARCH ON THIS, BUT DR. JANOV REALLY BELIEVES THAT THIS ALSO MAY BE BEHIND WHAT EVENTUALLY CAUSES CANCER, THIS SORT OF MASSIVE REPRESSION ON THE CELLULAR LEVEL THAT PREVENTS NATURAL GROWTH AND THEN OVERTIME CREATES CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES. KR: ID LIKE TO READ ANOTHER SHORT SECTION HERE, DR. JANOV WRITES, WHAT MOST OF MEDICINE AND PSYCHOTHERAPY INVOLVES TODAY IS THE TREATMENT OF FRAGMENTS OF THE HUMAN BEING. WE THEN GO ABOUT TREATING THE VARIED OFFSHOOTS FROM A CENTRAL IMPRINT, RATHER THAN THE IMPRINT ITSELF. TREATMENT BECOMES INTERMINABLE, WHAT WE GET IS A FRAGMENT OF PROGRESS, A CHANGE IN ASPECTS OF AN EARLY EXPERIENCE, RATHER THAN A HOLISTIC RECALIBRATION OR NEURO AND PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS CONNECTED WITH THE EXPERIENCE. JL: RIGHT. I THINK THATS REALLY TO KIND OF TAKE THAT AND KIND OF GO TIED IN WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYING COMPARISONS HE DRAWS IN THE BOOK TO SOMEBODY LIKE FREUD, THE RELATIONSHIP HE HAS WITH SOME OF THE EARLIER SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT PRECEDED HIM IS COMPLICATED. FREUD HE HAD THIS NOTION THAT HYSTERIA WAS ROOTED IN REPRESSED SEXUAL DESIRE AND HE OFTEN CHARTED IT IN DREAMS AND SORT OF THIS SYMBOLIC NOTION OF DREAMS. I THINK WHAT JANOV REALLY DOES IS HE TAKES, MUCH LIKE THOSE I THINK, THINKERS WHO DWELLED IN BIG IDEAS AND SORT OF PROFOUND CONCLUSIONS, HE SORT OF NOTES THAT WHILE FREUD WAS WORKING ON THE SYMBOLIC LABELS AND MISSED A LOT, HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS. INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOW THIS HYSTERIA WOULD CONSTANTLY BE UNREFLECTIVE AND PRONE TO OVERREACTION, AND JANOV WOULD SAY THAT YES THESE TRAITS EXIST, BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR SYMBOLS IN DREAMS, HELL LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF WHATS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN WERE HAVING NIGHTMARES. WHATS HAPPENING TO US BIOLOGICALLY WHEN WE HAVE A NIGHTMARE, OR WHAT DO WE FEEL DURING THAT TIME, AND WHY IS THAT TERROR COMING UP. HELL LOOK TO THE LIMBIC SYSTEM TO FIND WHERE THE TERROR IS ACTUALLY ROOTED. HES NOT TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THATS GOING TO CALM DOWN A PATIENT WHO HAS ADD OR DEPRESSION FOR THE DAY OR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. EVEN SOMETHING THAT MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO, HES REALLY LOOKING TO SOMETHING THAT CAN EVENTUALLY PROMOTE A CURE. KR: IM GOING TO READ ONE MORE PARAGRAPH OK? ON MY END DR. JANOV WRITES, THE BRAIN WE NEED TO ADDRESS DOESNT TALK, DOESNT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT DOESNT UNDERSTAND WORDS. IN FACT, THE TERM UNDERSTAND IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER, WE ARE NOT AFTER UNDERSTANDING IN THE INTELLECTUAL SENSE OF THE TERM, WE ARE AFTER INTEGRATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT CEREBRAL UNDERSTANDING. YES, UNDERSTANDING HELPS, BUT IT MUST NOT BE CONFUSED WITH RESOLVING, CONNECTING AND INTEGRATING. WHEN A THERAPIST TRIES TO GET A PATIENT TO REPORT ON HIS FEELINGS ALL MAY BE LOST, FOR THOSE FEELINGS MAY BE WORDLESS. TRYING TO EXPRESS THEM VERBALLY DISTANCES US FROM THE ORIGINS OF OUR PAIN IN THE LOWER BRAIN, AND SINCE ONE LAYER OF BRAIN TISSUE CANNOT DO THE WORK OF ANOTHER WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY TRUMPED OR EFFORTS, ONCE WE GET AWAY FROM WORDS WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT IS CURATIVE. UNDERSTANDING CAME LAST IN HUMAN EVOLUTION, LONG AFTER FEELING, AND IT WILL NOT LEAD US TO THE LONG TERM HEALING WE ARE AFTER. NONE OF THIS REQUIRES ABSTRACT OR ESOTERIC METHODS, WE CAN MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN SOCIETY JUST BY PAYING ATTENTION TO GESTATION AND CHANGING OUR BIRTH PRACTICES. JL: RIGHT, AND I MEAN I THINK THATS ONE OF THE BOOKS KEY CONCLUSIONS, IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT BIRTH PRACTICES AND LOOK AT A MOTHERS EMOTIONAL STATE AS NOT JUST NOT AT ALL INCIDENTAL. I THINK THE IDEA THAT FEELING IS CONNECTED TO OUR BIOLOGY AND HAS THESE SORT OF BIOLOGIC IMPLICATIONS, WE CAN SEE IT IN OUR BIOLOGY IS A PRETTY DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE FIELD. A FIELD THAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY TALK THERAPY AND BY APPROACHES REALLY FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS, NOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN. THATS WHERE I THINK DR. JANOV IS REALLY LOOKING TO GO. KR: WELL, IT EXCITES ME BECAUSE I THINK IT OPENS A HUGE DOOR. I THINK IT OPENS AN ENORMOUS DOOR OF UNDERSTANDING AND OF SUGGESTING VERY FUNDAMENTAL, NONE ESOTERIC, AS HE SAYS, SIMPLE BIRTH PRACTICES, PRACTICES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILD BIRTHING THAT CAN HAVE THE MOST DRAMATIC AND FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR HUMAN FUTURE. IT CAN PROBABLY DO MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE BILLABLE HOURS IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROFESSION. JL: YES, I THINK THERE WAS A CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK THAT CAME ABOUT LATER SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH PREGNANCY, AND I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME WORKING WITH DR. JANOV IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND JUST KIND OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE CONSTANT INFLUX OF NEW IDEAS AND RESEARCH HE WAS EXPOSING ME TO AND ALL THE WORK THAT WAS BEING DONE, IN THE FIELD OF EPIGENETICS AND IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL HEALTH AND NEW STUDIES HE WAS SHOWING ME ABOUT MEMORY AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE OTHER TOPICS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK REALLY STUCK WAS THIS IDEA ABOUT WHAT TO DO DURING PREGNANCY. AND HE ENDED UP SORT OF WRITING A CHAPTER ON PREGNANCY AND JUST OFFERING SOME ALMOST CONCRETE PIECES OF ADVICE FOR WOMEN THAT CAN HAVE SOME REALLY LASTING IMPLICATIONS. AS HE WRITES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OXYMORON FOR ME TO GIVE ADVICE SINCE I AM NOT BY PROFESSION NOR INTENTION AN AFICIONADO OF ADVICE. BUT LET US NOT MINIMIZE WHAT A CARRYING MOTHER CAN DO FOR THE GOOD OR BAD OF HER CHILD. IT IS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THAT HE APPROACHES THE SUBJECT, BECAUSE HE IS MALE AND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT IF YOURE SORT OF PROVIDING SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOW IT BEHAVED. BUT THINGS LIKE WATCHING YOUR STRESS; IF I CAN READ JUST A COUPLE PARTS OF THIS CHAPTER I THINK ITS REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE IS NO WAY TO ELIMINATE STRESS ENTIRELY, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS TO MANAGE IT. DONT PLAN A NEW BUSINESS OR START A SERIES OF COMPLICATED PROJECTS THAT PUT YOU UNDER STRESS WHILE PREGNANT. THE BABY WILL FEEL THIS ANXIETY AND SUFFER. TRY TO WORK OUT PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SPOUSE BEFORE YOU GET PREGNANT. ONCE YOU ARE PREGNANT, IT IS LARGELY TOO LATE. THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD NEVER ARGUE OR FIGHT AGAIN; BUT TRY TO RESOLVE THE MORE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES BEFORE YOU INTRODUCE A NEW LIFE ON THIS PLANET. THE BABY DESERVES HIS OR HER BEST CHANCE AT LIFE, AND WHAT YOU DO DURING PREGNANCY TO MANAGE YOUR STRESS IS IMPORTANT, IN THAT REGARD. HE TALKS ABOUT EATING RIGHT AND GETTING PROTEIN, CALCIUM, FOLIC ACID, FIBER. HE TALKS ABOUT BEING VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GOING ABOUT TRANQUILIZERS AND PAINKILLERS TO RELIVE ANXIETY. NEW STUDIES ARE COMING OUT ALL THE TIME ON THIS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NEW STUDIES ON THE USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS, THE USE OF TRANQUILIZERS DURING PREGNANCY, AND WERE STILL KIND OF FIGURING OUT WHAT ALL THIS DOES, ULTIMATELY IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE MOTHER TO KEEP HER EMOTIONS BALANCED BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO SEE WHAT OTHER EFFECTS THIS COULD HAVE DURING GESTATION. I THINK THE MAIN THING HE FOCUSES ON ALL OF THIS IS LOVE. TO TOUCH YOUR BABY EARLY ON, TO BREASTFEED IF YOU CAN, HE SAYS, "READ FRENCH OBSTETRICIAN FREDERIC LEBOYER, WHO POPULARIZED THE PRACTICE OF IMMERSING THE NEWBORN IN A WARM WATER BATH, WITHOUT DRUGS AND WITHOUT BRIGHT LIGHTS. LEBOYER RECOMMENDS THAT THE BABY BE HELD RIGHT AWAY AND FOR A LONG TIME. HE ADVISES AGAINST CUTTING THE UMBILICAL CORD TOO SOON AS THE CHILD'S ATTACHMENT WITH HIS MOTHER IS VITAL AT THE START OF LIFE." "THERE IS NO GREATER ADVICE I CAN GIVE THAN THIS: BE OPEN, EXPRESSIVE, AND FEELING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. A CARING MOTHER GIVES HER BABY THE BEST CHANCE FOR LONG-TERM WELL-BEING. YES, EVEN IF YOU DON'T EAT THOSE CARROTS AND TOMATOES WHEN YOU SHOULD, LOVE WILL HELP. YOUR CHILD IS PART OF YOU AND FEELS WHAT YOU FEEL, EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS IT. ALL I ASK IS AWARENESS. THE RESEARCH IS THERE; WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS ANYMORE." HE'S PUTTING IT OUT THERE, WE HAVE RESEARCH INTO THIS FIELD, WE CAN'T TURN A BLIND EYE TO IT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN.
158	THE CONTEST WHEN IT COMES TO AEBLESKIVER, JAM IS THE SECRET. NOT NECESSARILY FOR ENHANCING THE TRADITIONAL DANISH PUFF PASTRY TASTE THOUGH IT HELPS BUT FOR MAXIMUM SPEED WHEN INHALING THE RACQUET BALL-SIZED PANCAKE PUFFS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ITS SO DOUGHY, YOU CANT CHEW IT, SAID BRIAN HANRAHAN, A ONE-TIME AEBLESKIVER EATING CONTEST CHAMPION WHO SWEARS BY THE JAM. HE LOST HIS TITLE LAST YEAR WHEN DEFENDING IT AGAINST THE RUNNER-UP FROM 2013. THE RASPBERRY JAM, HANRAHAN CONTENDS, HELPS THE AEBLESKIVER SLIDE DOWN THE THROAT. THATS KEY DURING THE ANNUAL AEBLESKIVER EATING CONTEST AT SOLVANGS DANISH DAYS A BOUT THIS YEAR BETWEEN EIGHT GROWN MEN WHO, WITH THEIR HANDS TIED BEHIND THEIR BACKS, ARE CHALLENGED TO EAT AS MANY OF THE TREATS IN FIVE MINUTES AS POSSIBLE. IT TAKES PLACE TWICE DURING THE FESTIVAL, ONCE FOR ADULTS, AND AGAIN FOR CHILDREN. BY THE END OF THE COMPETITION, MOST WERE BELLYACHING, CAKED IN CONFECTIONERS SUGAR AND STICKY WITH JAM. THEY ALL LOOKED LIKE THEY HAD BEEN IN A TERRIBLE FIGHT, ONE ONLOOKER SAID. AS THE COMPETITION GOT UNDERWAY, SUPPORTIVE WIVES AND GIRLFRIENDS POPPED OPEN CUPS OF JAM AND DRIZZLED THEM ON THE AEBLESKIVER AS THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS ATTACKED THEIR PLATES. MORE JAM! ONE BEARDED CONTESTANT BELLOWED OUT BEFORE A CROWD OF ONLOOKERS. SWALLOW IT WHOLE! ANOTHER YELLED. WHEN HANRAHAN COMPETED, HE DOWNED 11, THE SAME NUMBER AS SATURDAYS REIGNING CHAMP THIS YEAR. ANTON RILEY, THE LOSER OF THE COMPETITION, ATE SEVEN. I ONLY ATE SEVEN, DAD. I FAILED YOU THIS YEAR, RILEY TOLD HIS FATHER. LOCAL TO THE AREA, RILEY HAS BEEN COMING TO DANISH DAYS FOR YEARS. HIS DOWNFALL THIS YEAR, HE SAID, WAS THE LARGE BACON, EGGS AND CORNBREAD BREAKFAST HE HAD THAT MORNING. OR ITS BECAUSE ITS DISGUSTING TO EAT MORE THAN SEVEN AEBLESKIVER IN FIVE MINUTES, HE SAID, AFTER WIPING HIMSELF CLEAN WITH A PAPER TOWEL. PAPA HEINZ IT WOULD SEEM LIKE A STRANGE PAIRING ON DANISH DAYS, TO HAVE A GERMAN PERFORMING DANISH FOLK SONGS. BUT HEINZ TRILCK, OR PAPA HEINZ AS HED RATHER BE KNOWN, DOESNT SWEAT IT. HE POPS A PAPER DANISH FLAG INTO THE RIBBON OF HIS BOWLER CAP, GRABS HIS ACCORDION AND HITS THE STREETS. FROM THE CORNER OF THE COPENHAGEN HOUSE, HE DELIGHTS TOURISTS WHO SADDLE UP BESIDE HIM AND POSE FOR PHOTOS AS HE PUMPS OUT DANISH DITTIES. ONE CHINESE TOURIST WITH A CAMERA STRAPPED AROUND HIS NECK EASED HIMSELF BESIDE PAPA AND BEGAN CLACKING AT HIS KEYS. OH YOU WANT TO PLAY, HEINZ SAID. THE TOURIST BEGAN TOOTING OUT THE STAR WARS THEME AS HEINZ WORKED THE WIND SECTION OF THE ACCORDION, MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF HIS WIFE, WHO STOOD BACK SNAPPING PHOTOS OF THEM ON HER PHONE. A SHOWBOAT, HE RELISHES IN THE ATTENTION BEFORE STARTING TO PLAY LA CUCARACHA. ITS A DANISH TUNE, HE JOKED. SO MANY SONGS MAKE THEIR WAY ALL AROUND THE WORLD. HEINZ BEGAN PLAYING THE ACCORDION 60 YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS 21 YEARS OLD, BUT IT WASNT UNTIL ANOTHER ACCORDION PLAYER RETIRED EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT HE STARTED PLAYING AT DANISH DAYS. THE BEST PART, HEINZ SAID, IS MEETING THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE FESTIVAL YEAR AFTER YEAR. I MEET LITTLE GIRLS WHO ARE THIS TALL, HE SAID, MOTIONING WAIST HIGH. NOW THEYRE BIG, BUT MORE SHY NOW. A ROCKING FLOAT WITH A GUITARIST AND DRUMMER WAILING LED ZEPPELINS IMMIGRANT SONG FROM A PARADE FLOAT FILLED WITH A GROUP OF BEER-POURING BARTENDERS, FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN BREWERYS HIGH-ENERGY FLOAT MADE A SPLASH AT SOLVANGS DANISH DAYS PARADE SATURDAY. WERE VERY COMPETITIVE. WE LIKE TO ENTERTAIN AND OF COURSE WERE GOING TO BRING OUR BEST EVERY TIME WE COME, OUR BEER AS WELL AS OUR SHOW, FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN BREWING CO. CO-OWNER JIM DIETENHOFER SAID. THE BREW MASTERS CAME OUT WITH A BUS WRAPPED IN WOOD PANELING AND FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN BEER LABELS ALONG WITH A TRUCK PULLING A TRAILER STAGED WITH THE FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN BAND, FOLLOWED BY A VIKING SHIP. IMMIGRANT SONG IS ACTUALLY ABOUT VIKINGS, JAMIE DIETENHOFER, CO-OWNER OF FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN BREWING CO. SAID. WE JUST LOVE ROCKING AND HAVING FUN. LAST YEAR, THE BREWING COMPANY STAGED IMPROMPTU BATTLES BETWEEN BARTENDERS DRESSED AS VIKINGS ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE, HE ADDED. WE LIKE TO MIX IT UP, DIETENHOFER SAID.
159	VERY OFTEN, WHEN IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT PENTAX CAMERAS YOU'LL HEAR THE PHRASE: 'IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO SPORT PHOTOGRAPHY THIS CAMERA (K-30) IS EXCELLENT FOR YOU' ANDI AM ALWAYS SURPRISED BY THIS PHRASE. I TAKE PHOTOS OF MANY TYPES OF SPORT COMPETITIONS: FOOTBALL, BEACH VOLLEYBALL, FIGHTING, ATHLETICS, CLASSIC RALLY, DRIFT, RALLY-RAID, MOTO-CROSS, FREESTYLE-MOTOCROSS AND STUNT-RIDING, TO NAME A FEW. FROM THE START OF MY CAREER I USED PENTAX EQUIPMENT, BEGINNING WITH THE K20D AS WELL AS THE K-01 AND 645D AND NOW I USE A BLUE PENTAX K-30 FOR TAKING MY SHOTS. RECENTLY I HAD THE CHANCE TO TEST THIS INEXPENSIVE AND RELIABLE CAMERA IN VERY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS AND FOR MY EFFORTS I RECEIVED ACCREDITATION AT THE WORLD SUPERBIKE STAGE. ON THE SATURDAY OF THE SHOOT, THE RACE CIRCUIT AT THE MOSCOW RACEWAY WAS COVERED BY CLOUD BUT IT SOON GOT A LOT WORSE WHEN SUNDAY ARRIVED. DRIZZLING RAIN WHICH BEGAN ON THE FIRST LAP OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS SUPERBIKES HIT THE TRACK AND IT SOON BECAME REALLY HEAVY RAINFALL! HOWEVER, LUCKILY, THIS WAS NO BIG PROBLEM FOR ME! I'VE GOTTEN USED TO RAIN AND IT GAVEME A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THE QUALITY OF THE DUST-PROOFING AND WATERPROOFING OF THE K-30. AS I EXPECTED, THE MOISTURE PROTECTION OF THE CAMERA PROVED TO BE EXCELLENT. I WAS SHOOTING IN THE RAIN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND HAD NO PROBLEMS. ON A SIDE NOTE, THE REASON WHY I WASATTRACTED TO THIS CAMERA IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS BECAUSE OF ITS 16MP SENSOR THAT ALSO FEATURES IN MY K-5. I ALSOREALLY LIKE THE AGGRESSIVE SPORTY DESIGN THE CAMERA HAS SO ALL-IN-ALL, THE CAMERA WAS WORTH LOOKING AT. PLUS NOW, AFTER SHOOTING SUPERBIKE COMPETITIONS, IT'S BEEN CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS THE CAMERA FOR ME. I MUST ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW COMPACT ANDLIGHT WEIGHT THIS MODEL IS. EVEN WITH A 400MM LENS ATTACHED, THIS CAMERA DOESN'T WEAR YOU OUT WHEN SHOOTING ALL DAY. IT ALSO HAS A VERY COMFORTABLE GRIP. WORKING IN AUTOFOCUS MODE WITH AF TRACKING AND CONTINUOUS SHOOTINGWAS VERY EASY! THE CAMERA DID EVERYTHING ITSELF AND WHETHER THE SUBJECT WAS MOVING PARALLEL TO OR AWAY FROM THE CAMERA, THE RESULT WAS THE SAME. THE CAMERA IS ACCURATE, WITH VIRTUALLY ERROR-FREE FOCUS. AND EVEN WHEN THE RAIN CLOSED IN, THE CAMERA STILL WORKED WITHOUT ERROR. IT ALSO PERFORMED WELL AT HIGHER ISO LEVELS, I WAS SHOOTING WITH ISOS AROUND THE 800-1600 MARK,AND ITS OPTICAL STABILIZER ALSO PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN THESE CONDITIONS. CAMERAS WHICH DON'T OFFER THIS STABILIZER AND HAVE POOR QUALITY HIGHER ISOS MAKE MY JOB A LOT HARDER. IT'S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING THE TWO CONTROL WHEELS THE CAMERA HAS AS WITH A RAPID ROTATION OF BOTH, I COULD QUICKLY SET THE DESIRED PARAMETERS WITHOUT TAKING MY EYE FROM THE VIEWFINDER. ALL OF THESE QUALITIES ALLOW ME TO CONCLUDE THAT THE K-30, DESPITE ITS LOW PRICE, ALLOWS ME TO CAPTURE SPORT EVENTS IN THE MOST DIFFICULT OF CONDITIONS.

161	SEPTEMBER IS NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS MONTH, PART OF AN EFFORT TO HELP US BETTER PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS OUR COMMUNITIES MAY FACE. THIS YEARS THEME IS, DONT WAIT. COMMUNICATE. MAKE YOUR EMERGENCY PLAN TODAY, STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING A PLAN TO KEEP YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SAFE IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER. EMERGENCIES CAN ARISE IN AN INSTANT, AND WHILE WE OFTEN CANT PREVENT THEM, TAKING PROPER PRECAUTIONS CAN HELP LIMIT THEIR IMPACT. LAST YEAR, A MICROBURST IN EAST SYRACUSE TOOK DOWN TREES AND LEFT THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS IN THE VILLAGE WITHOUT POWER FOR UP TO A WEEK. HAVING AN EVENT OF THIS MAGNITUDE HIT SO CLOSE TO HOME REMINDS US THAT EVENTS LIKE THIS ARE ALL TOO COMMON. DISASTER CAN STRIKE IMMEDIATELY, AND YOU MAY LOSE ELECTRICITY OR HAVE TO LEAVE YOUR HOME UNEXPECTEDLY, SO ITS ESSENTIAL TO PREPARE. GATHERING WITH YOUR FAMILY TO DISCUSS WHAT TO DO IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO HELP ENSURE YOUR SAFETY. BE SURE TO AGREE ON A SAFE PLACE TO MEET OUTSIDE YOUR HOME, AND MAKE AN EVACUATION PLAN FOR ALL FAMILY MEMBERS, INCLUDING PETS. ALSO TAKE A MOMENT TO CHECK YOUR HOMES FIRE EXTINGUISHERS AND SMOKE AND CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS OR INSTALL THEM IF YOU HAVENT DONE SO ALREADY. THESE SAFETY FEATURES CAN ALERT YOU TO MOST IMMEDIATE DANGERS IN YOUR HOME AND HELP PREVENT UNNECESSARY FIRE DAMAGE OR SEVERE INJURY. MANY OF US ASSUME THAT FIRST RESPONDERS WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO REACH US IMMEDIATELY IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ISNT ALWAYS THE CASE DANGEROUS CONDITIONS, ROAD CLOSURES AND THE NEED TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATE THREATS TO THE DISABLED AND ELDERLY ARE JUST SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT CAN IMPACT RESPONSE TIME.

162	BY: MS KIMAAYA MEDITATION IS THE BASIS FOR ALL INNER WORK. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT ONE CAN DISCOVER IS A DANCE MEDITATION. DANCE MOVEMENT PROVIDES THE CONDITIONS FOR LEARNING, GROWTH AND HEALING THROUGH COMPASSIONATE, EMBODIED AWARENESS WITHIN A THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP. THERE'S A DANCER IN EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US. FREEING OURSELVES TO REFOCUS INWARDLY AND IN COMMUNITY ALLOWS US TO SEE WHO WE ARE, AND SO THIS WILL BE A COMPLEX BUT AT THE SAME TIME A SIMPLIFIED PROCESS OF SELF-DISCOVERY. AS WE CONNECT TO THE DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF OUR EMBODIED BEING, WE AWAKEN OUR SOMATIC INTELLIGENCE AND BEGIN TO KNOW OUR TRUE NATURE. DANCE REFLECTS AN INDIVIDUALS PATTERNS OF THINKING, FEELING AND COMMUNICATING. DANCING IS A MEANS OF SELF-DISCOVERY. IT IS A FORM OF ART WHERE THE BODY IS THE INSTRUMENT. DANCING IS A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF LIBERATING YOUR BODY, MIND AND SOUL, FROM YOUR CONSCIOUS AWARENESS TO DEEP DOWN WITHIN YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND. DANCE OFFERS NOT JUST AS A CREATIVE OUTLET OF EXPRESSION, BUT ALSO TO RELEASE PENT-UP EMOTIONS. TRUST YOUR BODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S DOING AS YOU BREATHE, LISTEN AND RECEIVE ALLOW YOUR BODY TO BE AN EXTENSION OF YOU. TRANSFORMATION TAKES PLACE WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL IS READY TO MAKE CHANGES IN HIS/HER LIFE AND LOOK WITHIN TO FIND TRUTH, AND AUTHENTICITY. THIS UNIQUE MOVING MEDITATION IS DESIGNED TO ASSIST YOU IN ACCESSING YOUR CONSCIOUS, SUBCONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS MINDS TO RELEASE ANY PHYSICAL, MENTAL, EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL BLOCKS FOR HEALING THROUGH THE INTUITIVE MOVEMENT AND NATURAL FLOW OF YOUR BODY. DANCE MEDITATION IS ABOUT GETTING IN TOUCH WITH OUR EMOTIONS, AND OUR SPIRITUAL ESSENCE, AND EXPRESSING THAT ENERGY THROUGH OUR PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS. TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OURSELVES, WE CAN DANCE WITH A VARIETY OF MUSICAL STYLES, INCLUDING JAZZ, ROCK, CLASSICAL, AND INTERNATIONAL MUSIC REGULAR PRACTICE OF DANCE MEDITATION CAN HELP PHASE OUT TENSION AND ANXIETY FROM YOUR LIFE. THIS ALLOWS YOUR MIND TO EXPAND AND YOUR SPIRIT TO SOAR, THUS HELPING YOU UNLEASH FEELINGS OF POSITIVITY AND JOY IN YOU. JAZZ IS ESSENTIALLY THE FATHER OF ALL DANCE STYLES. THE MOVEMENTS THAT CHARACTERIZE THIS FORM ARE VERY ISOLATED, STACCATO AND LINEAR. HIP-HOP EMPHASIZES RHYTHM WITH A STRONG BEAT AND THE POETRY OF MOVEMENT. STEPS MOSTLY MOVE IN A VERTICAL DIRECTION. THIS FORM SHOULD BE VERY STYLIZED AND ENIGMATIC. A ZUMBA FITNESS PROGRAM FUSES HYPNOTIC LATIN RHYTHMS AND EASY-TO-FOLLOW MOVES TO CREATE A FUN WORKOUT THAT IS MORE LIKE ATTENDING A PARTY THAN A DANCE OR EXERCISE CLASS. THE CONCEPT OF DANCING IS SOMETHING STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH GODS. FOR EXAMPLE, LORD KRISHNA AND HIS BELOVED DANCE THE DANCE OF LOVE IN THEIR SACRED VRINDAVAN GARDENS. LORD SHIVA, OFTEN PERSONIFIED AS THE DANCING LORD NATARAJA, IS CAPABLE OF DANCING A FURIOUS DANCE THAT BRINGS ABOUT MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DESTRUCTION. PERFORMERS OF INDIAN CLASSICAL DANCES OFTEN CONSIDER THEIR ART AS A FORM OF WORSHIP. AS A MATTER OF FACT MANY OF THE INDIAN CLASSICAL DANCE FORMS HAVE DEVELOPED AND FLOURISHED AS A RESULT OF SUCH TRADITIONS OF LEARNING, TEACHING AND PERFORMING DANCES IN TEMPLES. DANCE IS NOT ONLY LANGUAGE; IT IS ALSO "LISTENING." LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF THE WAVES WITHIN YOU. NOT ONLY THE MIND IS FREE OF OUTSIDE WORLD, BUT YOU ALSO GET A GOOD SLEEP. AFTER THE SOUND, MUSIC, AND MOVEMENT STOP, THEN ENTER INTO SILENCE. IN THIS SILENCE ONE CAN ABSORB THE QUALITIES EVOKED DURING THE DANCE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE DANCE. ==================================================================== (THE WRITER, MS KIMAAYA, IS A CERTIFIED TRAINER FOR ZUMBA AND KNOWS MORE THAN 20 STYLES OF DANCING.

166	TATA STEEL CAPITALISED ON THE FEDERAL RESERVES OVERNIGHT DECISION TO KEEP US INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED BY BRINGING TO MARKET A RS25 BILLION ($376 MILLION) BLOCK TRADE OF TATA MOTORS SHARES BEFORE THE MARKET OPENED ON FRIDAY. WITHIN THREE HOURS OF THE FED ANNOUNCEMENT, TATA STEEL MADE ITS MOVE TO CASH IN ON SOME OF ITS NON-CORE ASSETS BY LAUNCHING AN ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OF TATA MOTOR SHARES IN TWO TRANCHES. INDIA IS SEEN AS VULNERABLE TO ANY US RATE RISE BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR PORTFOLIO CAPITAL OUTFLOWS FROM EMERGING MARKETS AS INVESTORS REALLOCATE FUNDS TO US MARKETS. SO FED CHAIRWOMAN JANET YELLENS NO-HIKE DECISION GAVE INDIAN MARKETS SOME RELIEF ON FRIDAY, ADDING 1% TO THE SENSEX STOCK INDEX BY THE CLOSE AND SHAVING 4 BASIS POINTS OFF 10-YEAR INDIAN GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS. A SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THE TATA MOTORS TRANSACTION CONFIRMED THAT THE BOOK OPENED AT THE UNUSUAL HOURS OF 3:00AM LOCAL TIME BECAUSE THE COMPANY WANTED TO WAIT FOR THE FED DECISION BEFORE DECIDING ON THE LAUNCH.IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN STARTED MUCH EARLIER ALSO BECAUSE TATA MOTORSS AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS TRADED UNTIL 1:30AM MUMBAI TIME. THE DEAL COMPRISED A $188 MILLION PUBLIC TRANCHE TO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND A PRIVATE TRANCHE OF THE SAME SIZE TO TATA SONS, THE DE FACTO HOLDING COMPANY OF TATA GROUP. IN THE PUBLIC TRANCHE THE TATA MOTORS SHARES WERE OFFERED AT RS324.50 RS338.05. THE FINAL PRICE WAS SETTLED AT THE LOWEST END OF THAT RANGE AND REPRESENTED A 4% DISCOUNT TO THE LAST CLOSE AT RS338.05. A TOTAL OF 77 MILLION SHARES WERE OFFLOADED IN BOTH TRANCHES, REPRESENTING 2.66% OF TATA MOTORSS SHARE CAPITAL. CITIGROUP WAS THE SOLE BOOKRUNNER OF THE TRANSACTION. HEDGE FUND INTEREST MANY HEDGE FUNDS SAW THE TATA MOTORS BLOCK AS AN OPPORTUNISTIC TRADE AND WILL BE HAPPY GIVEN THAT THE STOCK ENDED DOWN 2.3% ON FRIDAY, WHICH MEANS INVESTORS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE BLOCK EFFECTIVELY GOT A 1.7% GAIN IN A SINGLE-DAY TRADE. TATA MOTORS, WHICH MANUFACTURES JAGUAR LAND ROVER CARS IN INDIA, IS A VERY LIQUID STOCK AND AVERAGED $41 MILLION WORTH OF TRADE EVERY DAY OVER THE PAST MONTH. THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC TRANCHE EQUATES TO ONLY 4.5 DAYS' TRADING VOLUME. FOR THAT REASON HEDGE FUNDS WERE PARTICULARLY KEEN TO JOIN IN THE DEAL. ROUGHLY 70% OF THE PUBLIC TRANCHE WAS TAKEN UP BY HEDGE FUNDS, INCLUDING A LARGE ANCHOR ORDER, WHILE THE REMAINDER WAS SPLIT BETWEEN LONG-ONLY FUNDS AND DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS, SAID THE SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THE DEAL. TRADING AT A PRICE-TO-EARNINGS RATIO OF 7.4 TIMES ON A FORWARD TWELVE-MONTH BASIS, TATA MOTORS IS ONE OF THE CHEAPEST AUTO MANUFACTURERS IN ASIA, ALTHOUGH ITS GROWTH PROSPECTS MAY NOT BE AS BRIGHT AS JAPANESE PEERS LIKE TOYOTA AND MITSUBISHI MOTORS, WHICH BENEFIT FROM A SHARPLY DEVALUED CURRENCY. THE TATA MOTORS BLOCK TRADE FORMS PART OF TATA STEELS BROADER ATTEMPT TO MONETISE ITS NON-CORE ASSETS SO AS TO REDUCE ITS DEBT-GEARING RATIO, WHICH STOOD AT 213.7% AS OF THE END OF MARCH. IN THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD TO END-JUNE, THE STEEL MAKER RAISED RS10 BILLION BY SELLING PART OF ITS EQUITY PORTFOLIO, ACCORDING TO A COMPANY STATEMENT. TATA STEEL IS ONE OF THE EPICENTRES OF A SERIES OF CROSS SHARE HOLDINGS BETWEEN THE PUBLICLY-LISTED ENTITIES OF TATA GROUP. THE STEEL UNITS ROUGHLY $1 BILLION-WORTH OF EQUITY HOLDINGS INCLUDE 54.5% OF TATA SPONGE IRON, 50.9% OF TATA METALIKS, AND A 74.96% STAKE INTINPLATECOMPANY OF INDIA. COMPLETION OF THE DEAL SAW TATA STEEL LOWER ITS STAKE IN TATA MOTORS TO 5.5%, WHILE TATA SONSS STAKE INCREASED TO 25.7% AND REMAINS AS THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER. TATA MOTORS SHARES ARE DOWN 33% YEAR-TO-DATE, LAGGING SOME WAY BEHIND SENSEXS 4.3% LOSS OVER THE SAME PERIOD. THE COMPANY REPORTED LOWER MARGINS DUE TO NEW PLANT EXPENSES AND HIGHER MARKETING SPENDING, WHILE ITS CHINA BUSINESS ALSO SUFFERED FROM CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. HAVING SOLD 300,000 VEHICLES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR VERSUS A TARGET OF AROUND 420,000, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT TATA MOTORS WILL REACH ITS ANNUAL TARGET OF 500,000 CAR SALES, NOMURA ANALYST KAPIL SINGH SAID IN A RESEARCH NOTE. IN THE QUARTER ENDING JUNE THE AUTOMAKER REPORTED A PROFIT AFTER TAX OF RS27.7 BILLION, A 49% DECLINE FROM A YEAR EARLIER.

168	ARCHIVED -- BUFFALO SABRES FORWARD JASON AKESON FACES A HEARING FRIDAY BEFORE THE NHL DEPARTMENT OF PLAYER SAFETY FOR CHARGING/ILLEGAL CHECK TO THE HEAD AFTER HE DELIVERED AN OPEN-ICE HIT ON OTTAWA SENATORS FORWARD COLIN GREENING DURING A PRESEASON GAME.  ALTHOUGH A SHARP SLIP FIELDER, HIS RUNNING BETWEEN WICKETS WAS OFTEN LAMENTABLE, LEAVING BATTING PARTNERS FUMING AS THEY TRUDGED OFF AS CASUALTIES OF A WATSON-INDUCED MIX-UP. THE HIT OCCURRED MIDWAY THROUGH THE THIRD PERIOD ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN AKESON CAUGHT GREENING WITH HIS HEAD DOWN. GREENING WAS WOBBLY AS HE LEFT THE ICE AND DID NOT RETURN TO THE GAME, BUT NO PENALTY WAS ASSESSED FOR THE HIT. AFTER THE COLLISION, GREENING'S TEAMMATE, TRAVIS EWANYK, FOUGHT WITH AKESON, WHO RECEIVED A FIVE-MINUTE FIGHTING MAJOR. THE DISCIPLINARY HEARING IS THE FIRST OF THE 2055-16 SEASON.  IN JULY, ACTIVISTS TRIED TO STOP AN ICEBREAKER KEY TO SHELL'S DRILLING PLANS FROM LEAVING PORT BY DANGLING FROM A BRIDGE. --SIX PLAYERS WERE RELEASED FROM THE BUFFALO SABRES' TRAINING CAMP ROSTER TO TRIM THE COUNT TO 50 PLAYERS. FORWARD COLIN JACOBS WAS LOANED TO ROCHESTER OF THE AMERICAN HOCKEY LEAGUE AND FORWARD ERIC CORNEL RETURNED TO PETERBOROUGH IN THE ONTARIO HOCKEY LEAGUE.  THE SITUATION WAS THE REVERSE FOR APPLE'S IOS.  THE ORGANIZATION DOES SOMETHING BIG AND EXCITING AND CLEVER AND IMPORTANT AND YOU, THE APPLICANT, ARE GOING TO HAVE A PART IN THAT! FOUR PLAYERS -- DEFENSEMEN JOSH CHAPMAN AND SPIRO GOULAKOS AND GOALTENDERS KEEGAN ASMUNDSON AND C.J. MOTTE -- WERE RELEASED FROM TRYOUTS. --THE WINNIPEG JETS TRIMMED 11 PLAYERS FROM THEIR ROSTER, REASSIGNING EIGHT TO THEIR AMERICAN HOCKEY LEAGUE AFFILIATE AND THREE TO JUNIOR CLUBS. JOINING THE AHL MANITOBA MOOSE'S TRAINING CAMP ARE AXEL BLOMQVIST, AUSTEN BRASSARD, AARON HARSTAD, DAVID LEGGIO, JIMMY LODGE, JUSSI OLKINUORA, BRENNAN SERVILLE AND PETER STOYKEWYCH. ASSIGNED TO JUNIORS WERE JANSEN HARKINS (PRINCE GEORGE, WHL), MATTEO GENNARO-PRINCE ALBERT (PRINCE GEORGE, WHL) AND MICHAEL SPACEK (RED DEER, WHL). --THE MINNESOTA WILD REDUCED THEIR TRAINING CAMP ROSTER TO 04 PLAYERS BY MAKING EIGHT ROSTER MOVES, INCLUDING THE ASSIGNING OF SIX PLAYERS TO THEIR AMERICAN HOCKEY LEAGUE AFFILIATE.  IT IS BEING CALLED "THE LARGEST CONSERVATION EFFORT EVER UNDERTAKEN." AND IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE.  HE THEN BEGINS AN EXAGGERATED CLAP, BEFORE STAMPING HIS FEET ON THE FLOOR WHILE MIMICKING SOMEONE WITH LEARNING DIFFICULTIES. THE WILD SENT LEFT WING RAPHAEL BUSSIERES, FORWARD TANNER EBERBLE, DEFENSEMEN GUILLAUME GELINAS AND ALEX GUDBRANSON AND GOALTENDERS BRODY HOFFMAN AND STEPHEN MICHALEK TO THE IOWA WILD. MINNESOTA ALSO ASSIGNED CENTER PAVEL JENYS TO SUDBURY OF THE ONTARIO HOCKEY LEAGUE AND RELEASED FORWARD SAM WARNING FROM AN AMATEUR TRYOUT CONTRACT.
169	A RECENT CLAIM FROM A STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT ALPHA TESTER HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE GAME IS BROKEN AND THAT IT IS RUSHED BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF THE MOVIE, EPISODE 7: THE FORCE AWAKENS THIS DECEMBER. DO PLAYERS HAVE TO START WORRYING ABOUT THE QUALITY OF STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WHEN IT RELEASES THIS NOVEMBER AND DO THE CLAIMS HOLD ANY MERIT, OR IS IT THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE AT WORK? HERE IS WHY RECENT CLAIMS BY A SUPPOSED ALPHA TESTER SHOULDNT GET YOU TOO WORRIED. THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT FIRST AND FOREMOST, THERE WILL BE AN OPEN BETA COMING IN EARLY OCTOBER. I RECENTLY REPORTED ON THE OPEN BETA AND ASKED IF A BETA OPEN TO EVERYONE COULD BE A SIGN OF OVERCONFIDENCE ON EAS PART. IF YOUVE BEEN ON THE FENCE ABOUT BUYING THE GAME, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF WITHOUT ANY KIND OF MONETARY INVESTMENT (EXCEPT FOR DOWNLOADING THE BETA, THE SIZE OF WHICH IS NOT CONFIRMED. IF STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WAS REALLY A BUG FILLED MESS, THEN AN OPEN BETA WOULD BE THE WORST POSSIBLE DECISION FROM EA AND DICE. IM NOT SAYING THE BETA WILL BE PERFECT, BUT TO THINK THAT THE DEVELOPER AND PUBLISHER WILL HOST AN OPEN BETA FOR A BROKEN GAME IS PREPOSTEROUS. THE SECOND IMPORTANT ASPECT TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE CLAIMS COME FROM AN ALPHA TEST, NOT BETA. ALPHA TEST VERSIONS ARE GENERALLY BUG FILLED MESSES, AS IT IS A VERY EARLY BUILD OF THE GAME TO TEST FUNCTIONALITY. IF THE QUALITY OF A RELEASE VERSION OF ANY GAME WAS DETERMINED BY AN ALPHA TEST VERSION, EVERY GAME RELEASE WOULD BE A BROKEN MESS. FURTHERMORE, EA IS SEEMINGLY DOING A GOOD JOB WITH THE MULTIPLAYER, AS GARETH WOODS TRIED THE SQUADRON FIGHTER MODE LAST MONTH AND PRAISED THE GAME MODE FOR ITS AUTHENTIC FEELING AND FAST PACED ACTION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MR. WOODS DID NOT MENTION ANY BUGS OR ANYTHING GAME-BREAKING. NEOGAF USER ILLUCIO CLAIMS: I'VE BEEN ALPHA TESTING A FEW GAMES AND I CAN SAY BATTLEFRONT IS A COMPLETE MESS AND IS BROKEN. CONSIDERING THAT THEIR DEADLINE FOR THE GAME IS IN A FEW WEEKS AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T FIXED THE MAJORITY OF THE IN GAME PROBLEMS LET ALONE THE CONNECTION PROBLEM ME AND OTHER TESTERS WERE HAVING, YES IT'S GOING TO BE A MESS. AND EVEN A DAY 1 PATCH WON'T FIX ALL OF THEM, I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH OUTSIDE WHAT I PLAYED, BUT THE GAME IS INDEED RUSHED AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF EPISODE 7 RELEASING THIS DECEMBER. AND IN RETROSPECT I ALSO TESTED BLACK OPS 3 WHICH EVEN THOUGH IT HAD MANY PROBLEMS, IT WAS NO WHERE AS BAD AS BATTLEFRONT. SOURCE DO PLAYERS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED? IF YOU TAKE A LOOK BACK AT BATTLEFIELD 4'S LAUNCH, THEY DO HAVE A REASON NOT TO TRUST EA. MY NICHOLAS HOLDEN COLLEAGUE REPORTED MULTIPLE BATTLEFIELD 4 ISSUES, PC VERSION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY. HOWEVER, THE LATEST ENTRY IN THE BATTLEFIELD FRANCHISE, BATTLEFIELD: HARDLINE HAD AN EXCELLENT LAUNCH, AS I NOTED IN MY REVIEW THAT THE GAME WAS BASICALLY BUG FREE. IS THE BUG FREE STATE OF HARDLINE AT LAUNCH THE START OF A QUALITY LAUNCH TREND BY EA? HOPEFULLY. THE NEOGAF THREAD IN QUESTION IS ENTITLED QA TESTERS WARN: BROKEN GAMES FIASCO OF LAST YEAR MAY REPEAT THIS CHRISTMAS . ATTACHED IS A POLL ON WHICH AAA GAME, COMING THIS HOLIDAY, THE COMMUNITY THINKS WILL HAVE THE MOST BUGS. AT THE TIME OF WRITING, FALLOUT 4 IS ON TOP OF THE POLL, WITH ASSASSINS CREED: SYNDICATE IN SECOND PLACE AND STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT IN THIRD. HAVE PLAYERS LOST THEIR FAITH IN AAA GAME DEVELOPERS TO DELIVER A QUALITY, BUG FREE TITLE? IT SURE LOOKS THAT WAY. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING SCEPTICAL ABOUT A PRODUCT WHEN PREVIOUS TITLES BY A COMPANY HAVE HAD LESS THAN IDEAL LAUNCHES. HOWEVER, ITS ALSO NOT GOOD TO ALWAYS HAVE A GLASS HALF EMPTY OUTLOOK. I FOR ONE AM GIVING STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND WILL JUDGE THE GAME DURING THE OPEN BETA AND SUBSEQUENT FULL RELEASE. [EMBEDDED CONTENT] IN THE VIDEO ABOVE, YOU CAN SEE SOME ALPHA FOOTAGE IN ACTION, WHICH DOESNT LOOK BUGGY AT ALL. IF THERE IS ANY MERIT TO THE CLAIMS BY NEOGAF USER ILLUCIO, HOPEFULLY EA AND DICE WILL HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO FIX THE GAME BEFORE IT IS RELEASE. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT AN ALPHA VERSION OF THE GAME IS A LONG WAY OFF FULL RELEASE. STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WILL RELEASE ON PC, PLAYSTATION 4 AND XBOX ONE: NORTH AMERICA - NOVEMBER 17 EUROPE - NOVEMBER 19 (USUALLY SA RELEASE DATE AS WELL) UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 20 DO YOU THINK STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WILL BE BROKEN ON RELEASE OR WILL THE GAME HAVE LITTLE TO NO BUGS AT LAUNCH? LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK IN THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW. SOURCE: NEOGAF READ MORE ABOUT STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT: SILLICUR TWITTER /
170	LET ME SAY FIRST OFF: NOBODY KNOWS WHETHER WYOMINGS PLAN TO CONSERVE SAGE GROUSE IS GOING TO WORK. IF SOMEBODY DOES CLAIM TO KNOW WITH CERTAINTY, THEN YOU HAVE GOOD REASON TO BE SKEPTICAL. THATS BECAUSE SAGE GROUSE CONSERVATION IS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM WITHIN AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX NATURAL SYSTEM. WYOMINGS UPDATED PLAN, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE SPECIES MOST IMPORTANT HABITATS -- THEIR CORE AREAS -- MIGHT BE THE BIRDS BEST BET. BUT LIKE ANY PLAN, THE SUCCESS OF WYOMINGS CONSERVATION STRATEGY, AND SIMILAR STRATEGIES IN OTHER WESTERN STATES, WILL ULTIMATELY COME DOWN TO HOW WELL THE PLANS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY WE CAN ADAPT TO NEW INFORMATION AND EMERGING SCIENCE. WHATS NOTABLE IS THAT THIS EFFORT MIGHT WELL BE A MODEL FOR A NEW KIND OF APPROACH: A HOMEGROWN, STAKEHOLDER-INCLUSIVE, COLLABORATIVE MEANS TO CONSERVATION WHERE IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. RANCHERS, BIOLOGISTS, INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES, CONSERVATIONISTS, AGENCY AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND OTHERS ARE INVOLVED IN CRAFTING THE PLAN AND THUS HAVE STRONG BUY-IN FOR ASSURING ITS IMPLEMENTATION. FOR READERS WHO DONT KNOW, WYOMINGS PLAN IS THE PRODUCT OF AN UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATIVE EFFORT IN RECENT YEARS TO CONSERVE THE GREATER SAGE-GROUSE, WHICH IS ONE OF WYOMINGS AND THE WESTS MOST ICONIC, BEAUTIFUL -- AND IMPERILED -- SPECIES. GOVS. DAVE FREUDENTHAL AND MATT MEAD BOTH UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS AT STAKE: IF THE SAGE GROUSE WERE LISTED AS A THREATENED OR ENDANGERED SPECIES, ENERGY EXTRACTION AND OTHER TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT WOULD LIKELY BE CURTAILED THROUGHOUT THE BIRDS RANGE, AND NOT ONLY IN CORE HABITAT AREAS. IN A STATE THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON REVENUES FROM MINERAL EXTRACTION, SUCH A POSSIBILITY GETS FOLKS ATTENTION. IF WYOMING HADNT STEPPED UP WHEN IT DID, ITS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROTECTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN BOTH NECESSARY AND UNAVOIDABLE. SOMETIMES JUST THE THREAT OF THIS KIND OF FEDERAL ACTION CAN BE THE IMPETUS FOR BETTER WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES. OUR GOVERNORS APPROACH HAS BEEN TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE IN WYOMING, WHERE AN ESTIMATED 40 PERCENT OF THE REMAINING SAGE-GROUSE LIVE. FREUDENTHAL LED THE EFFORT TO CREATE WHAT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE STATES CORE AREA STRATEGY. MEAD HAS FURTHERED THAT EFFORT, REFINING THIS STRATEGY TWICE ALREADY, AS NEW INFORMATION AND NEW SCIENCE HAS EMERGED. THEY EMPOWERED A BROAD GROUP OF CITIZENS, EXPERTS AND SCIENTISTS TO WORK ON THE PROBLEM YEAR AFTER YEAR, DRAWING UPON UPON LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND STAKEHOLDER EXPERTISE, WITH THE COMMON GOAL OF MAKING SURE MEASURES ARE TAKEN SO THAT AN ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING DECISION IS NOT NECESSARY. THAT GOAL HAS BEEN, AND REMAINS, A TALL ORDER. SAGE GROUSE AND SAGE GROUSE HABITAT ARE IN TROUBLE. THE SPECIES HAS BEEN IN STEADY DECLINE FOR A LONG TIME NOW, AND ITS ESTIMATED THAT TODAY THERE ARE ABOUT 80 PERCENT TO 90 PERCENT FEWER SAGE GROUSE RANGE-WIDE THAN THERE WERE 150-200 YEARS AGO. WYOMINGS ACTIONS WILL LIKELY PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DETERMINING WHETHER OVERALL SAGE GROUSE POPULATIONS BEGIN TO STABILIZE OR CONTINUE TO DECLINE. MY OPINION: THE STATES PLAN CAN WORK IF ITS FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED. AND WHILE I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE, I ALSO KNOW THAT A GOOD PLAN CAN JUST AS QUICKLY BECOME AN EMPTY PROMISE IF COMMITMENT WAVERS. WYOMING WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN FOR DECADES, LONG AFTER THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE MAKES ITS LISTING DECISION THIS MONTH. STATE REGULATORS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL BE FACED WITH TOUGH DECISIONS AND BEFORE LONG THEY WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ALLOWING DEVELOPMENT OR PROTECTING IMPORTANT HABITAT -- THAT WILL BE THE TEST. AND YEARS FROM NOW I HOPE THIS ADMINISTRATIONS LEGACY IS NOT THAT IT KEPT THE BIRD OFF THE LIST IN 2015 BUT THAT IT KEPT IT FROM EXTINCTION. CRAFTING THE PLAN WAS THE EASY PART. LIVING UP TO ITS PROMISE? NOW THAT WILL TAKE SOME WORK.
171	ROB HALFORD LOOKS BACK ON PMRC: 'WE GOT ATTACKED FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER' SEPTEMBER 27, 2015 0 COMMENTS BACK IN THE MID-'80S, THE PMRC (PARENTS' MUSIC RESOURCE CENTER) PUBLISHED A LIST CALLED "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN" WHICH CONSISTED OF THE TOP FIFTEEN SONGS THEY WANTED BANNED DUE TO OBJECTIONABLE LYRICS SUGGESTING VIOLENCE, SEX, DRUGS, ALCOHOL OR THE OCCULT. THEY PETITIONED FOR LYRICS TO BE PRINTED ON THE ALBUM JACKETS AND NO ONE WAS SAFE HEAVY METAL ACTS WERE RIGHT THERE ALONGSIDE THE POP STARS. AC/DC, MADONNA, MTLEY CRE, JUDAS PRIEST, PRINCE, W.A.S.P., MERCYFUL FATE, VANITY, DEF LEPPARD, CYNDI LAUPER AND TWISTED SISTER ALL MADE "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN" LIST. IN NOVEMBER 1985, THE RIAA (RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA) AGREED TO PUT "PARENTAL ADVISORY: EXPLICIT LYRICS" LABELS ON SELECTED RELEASES AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION. ASKED WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO HAVE THE JUDAS PRIEST TRACK "EAT ME ALIVE" INCLUDED IN "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN," THE BAND'S LEAD SINGER, ROB HALFORD, TOLD CANADA'S C103 RADIO STATION: "IT WAS KIND OF TOUGH, BECAUSE WE GOT ATTACKED FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER. NONE OF US THAT ARE ON THAT LIST SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE, BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME SEE A BAND LIKE PRIEST OR MY MATE DEE [SNIDER] FROM TWISTED SISTER, WE WANNA GIVE YOU A GOOD TIME, WE WANNA HELP YOU FORGET ALL THE TROUBLES AND THE WORRIES IN THE WORLD. WE WANT YOU TO COME AND ENJOY YOURSELF, HAVE A FEW DRINKS, MEET YOUR MATES, HAVE A GREAT METAL EXPERIENCE, ROCK AND ROLL EXPERIENCE. SO, TO BE ACCUSED OF THAT WAS PRETTY LOW, BUT WE GOT THROUGH IT AND WE BATTLED ON, AND I THINK WE HAD A WIN FOR EVERYBODY IN THAT RESPECT." HALFORD ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE WAY SOCIETY HAS BECOME, IN HIS VIEW, TOO POLITICALLY CORRECT. HE SAID: "WELL, AGAIN, I COULD TALK FOREVER ON THAT SUBJECT. YOU KNOW, YEAH, I THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF GIVE EACH OTHER A BREAK AND KIND OF TAKE A LONG, DEEP BREATH AND LET IT OUT VERY SLOWLY, BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE CAN GET ATTENTION IN THESE TIMES IS TO SCREAM AS LOUD AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND TO SAY THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. SO IT'S A PITY, REALLY. IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD FROM WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AS A KID. BUT, HEY, THAT'S THE WAY HUMANITY IS EVOLVING, UNFORTUNATELY. AND IT'S NOT JUST IN THE STATES; IT'S EVERYWHERE. THERE'S THIS CRAZY CACOPHONY GOING ON. BUT LEAVE ALL THAT STUFF TO THE POLITICIANS AND TO ALL THE THE KIND OF NOISE THAT WE MAKE IN METAL IS THE BEST NOISE YOU CAN GET PLAIN AND SIMPLE." JUDAS PRIEST IS CONTINUING TO TOUR IN SUPPORT OF ITS LATEST ALBUM, "REDEEMER OF SOULS", WHICH WAS RELEASED IN JULY 2014. THE FOLLOW-UP TO 2008'S DOUBLE-DISC CONCEPT ALBUM "NOSTRADAMUS" WAS BILLED AS A RETURN TO JUDAS PRIEST'S HEAVY-METAL ROOTS. "REDEEMER OF SOULS" SOLD AROUND 32,000 COPIES IN THE UNITED STATES IN ITS FIRST WEEK OF RELEASE TO LAND AT POSITION NO. 6 ON THE BILLBOARD 200 CHART.

172	UNTIL NOW, THE SIHH, THE GENEVA-BASED JANUARY WATCH FAIR, WAS KNOWN TO BE A VERY LUXURIOUS EXHIBITION MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE RICHEMONT GROUP BRANDS. THE FHH, FONDATION DE LA HAUTE HORLOGERIE AND HOST OF THE SIHH, JUST DECIDED TO CHANGE THE FORMAT, FIRST BY BRINGING A NEW ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPT BUT MAINLY BY ADDING TO THE LIST OF THE EXHIBITING MAISONS 9 INDEPENDENT WATCHMAKERS AND NOT THE WORST ONES TO BE HONEST. UNTIL NOW, THE SIHH OR SALON INTERNATIONAL DE LA HAUTE HORLOGERIE, WAS WELCOMING 16 BRANDS. 12 OF THEM ARE OWNED BY THE RICHEMONT GROUP A. LANGE & SOHNE, BAUME & MERCIER, CARTIER, IWC, JAEGER-LECOULTRE, MONTBLANC, PANERAI, PIAGET, ROGER DUBUIS, VAN CLEEF & ARPELS AND VACHERON CONSTANTIN (PLUS RALPH LAUREN WATCHES THAT IS OPERATED BY RICHEMONT). IN ADDITION TOTHEM, 4 OTHER VERY HIGH-END MANUFACTURES WERE PRESENT: AUDEMARS-PIGUET, GREUBEL FORSEY PARMIGIANI-FLEURIER AND RICHARD MILLE. FOR THE 26TH EDITION THAT WILL START ON THE 18TH JANUARY 2016, THE FONDATION DE LA HAUTE HORLOGERIE WANTED TO ADD SOME NEW COMERS, FOCUSED ON HIGHLY CREATIVE AND HIGH-END WATCHES WITH A SORT OF SALON IN THE SALON. USING THE 1.500SQM PREVIOUSLY DEDICATEDTO RALPH LAURENT (THAT WILL NOW FOCUS ONLY ON THE US MARKET), THIS NEW SPACE WILL CELEBRATETHE NEW AND MODERN HOROLOGY. THE CARR DES HORLOGERS WILL HOST 9 OF OUR FAVORITES INDIES:CHRISTOPHE CLARET, DE BETHUNE, H. MOSER & CIE, HAUTLENCE, HYT, KARI VOUTILAINEN, LAURENT FERRIER, MB&F AND URWERK. A FUNNY FACT IS THAT MOST OF THESE NEW COMERS WERE ALREADY EXPOSINGON THE SIDELINES OF THE SIHH, DURING WHAT THE INDUSTRY CALLS THEWONDER WEEK, WHERE INDEPENDENT WATCHMAKERS ARE PRESENTING THEIR COLLECTIONS IN THE CITY-CENTER OF GENEVA. WITH THE FREE SPACE LET AFTER RALPH LAURENS DEPARTURE, THESE BRANDS WILL NOW OFFICIALLY BE PART OF THE SIHH. FABIENNE LUPO, CEO OFFONDATION DE LA HAUTE HORLOGERIE, EXPLAINS THE DECISION IN BILAN.CH (IN FRENCH): WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR SEVERAL YEARS.THE SIHH HAD ALREADY OPENED ITS DOORS TO INDEPENDENT WATCHMAKERS, IN 1998, WHEN THE SHOW WAS STILL IN HALL 07 OFPALEXPO. FOR EXAMPLE,ROGER DUBUIS HAD STARTED LIKE THIS.THE IDEA TO HIGHLIGHT SUCHWATCHMAKING TALENTS IS NOT NEW.HOWEVER,FOR TECHNICAL REASONS AND THE EXISTENCE OF PARALLEL EXHIBITIONS WHICH WERE ORGANIZED ON THE SIDELINES OF THE SIHH IN GENEVA, THIS INITIATIVE HAD NEVER MATERIALIZED AS IT WILL BE IN 2016. RALPH LAURENS DEPARTURE WAS THE TRIGGER.A FREE SPACE WE HAVE THEREFORE UTILIZED TO CREATE THIS NEW CARR DES HORLOGERS. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SIHH WITH NOW 24 BRANDS WITH SUCH A HIGHLY QUALITATIVE SELECTION WILL DEFINITELY CREATE A MAGNIFICENT EVENT, FROM WHICH WELL OF COURSE REPORT LIVE. RELATED
173	BUDAPEST, HUNGARY T THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS AS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS FLOOD INTO COUNTRIES ACROSS EUROPE. ALL TIMES LOCAL (CET): --- 12:20 P.M. MOHAMMED, A 24-YEAR-OLD ECONOMIST FROM THE SYRIAN CITY OF ALEPPO, SAYS THE CHAOS AT BUDAPEST'S KELETI TRAIN STATION IS THE WORST HE HAS SEEN SINCE LEAVING SYRIA. HUNGARY ON TUESDAY SUSPENDED ALL RAIL TRAFFIC FROM THAT STATION AND CLEARED IT OF HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS TRYING TO BOARD TRAINS FOR AUSTRIA AND GERMANY AFTER SCUFFLES BROKE OUT. MOHAMMED SAID HE BOUGHT A TICKET TO MUNICH FOR 200 EUROS ($225) AFTER HUNGARIAN POLICE TOLD HIM MONDAY NIGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE. DESPITE SHOWING A SYRIAN PASSPORT TO POLICE GUARDING THE PLATFORM, THEY TOLD HIM TUESDAY HE COULD NOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAVE A VISA FOR GERMANY. HE REFUSED TO GIVE HIS LAST NAME TO AN AP REPORTER BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT HIS FAMILY STILL IN ALEPPO. --- 12 NOON TENSIONS ARE FLARING ONCE AGAIN AT GREECE'S NORTHERN BORDER WITH MACEDONIA, WHERE ABOUT 1,500 MIGRANTS ARE WAITING TO CROSS THE BORDER AND HEAD NORTH TOWARD THE MORE PROSPEROUS EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES. FIGHTS AND SCUFFLES BROKE OUT TUESDAY AMONG THE CROWD NEAR THE GREEK VILLAGE OF IDOMENI WHEN HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, MAINLY FROM AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN, ATTEMPTED TO RUSH THE BORDER BEING GUARDED BY MACEDONIAN POLICE. MACEDONIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ALLOWING SMALL GROUPS TO CROSS AT A TIME AND HEAD TO THE GEVGELIJA TRAIN STATION. LAST MONTH, MACEDONIAN AUTHORITIES BRIEFLY HALTED ALL CROSSINGS AND USED STUN GRENADES AND BATONS TO PUSH BACK THE CROWD. --- 11:45 A.M. CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL SAYS GERMANY ISN'T TO BLAME FOR THE STREAM OF SYRIAN REFUGEES IN HUNGARY TRYING TO BOARD TRAINS HEADED FOR GERMANY. HUNGARY'S GOVERNMENT HAS PINPOINTED GERMANY'S "MORE FLEXIBLE ATTITUDE" TOWARD SYRIANS AS A PROBLEM THAT ENCOURAGES MIGRATION. GERMAN AUTHORITIES HAVE ADVISED OFFICIALS NOT TO SEND SYRIANS BACK TO THE FIRST EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRY WHERE THEY ARRIVED, AS EU RULES STIPULATE. MERKEL SAID TUESDAY THAT SYRIANS DO HAVE A HIGH CHANCE OF GETTING ASYLUM BUT "THAT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE ... AND SHOULD ACTUALLY BE SIMILAR IN EVERY EUROPEAN COUNTRY." MERKEL SAID "THE CURRENT RULES ARE CLEARLY NOT BEING PRACTICED." SHE SAID THE ANSWER IS A COMMON EUROPEAN ASYLUM POLICY WITH A "FAIR DISTRIBUTION" OF REFUGEES ACROSS THE 28-NATION EU. --- 11:20 A.M. HUNGARY HAS SUSPENDED ALL RAIL TRAFFIC FROM ITS MAIN TERMINAL IN BUDAPEST AND CLEARED THE TRAIN STATION OF HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS TRYING TO BOARD TRAINS FOR AUSTRIA AND GERMANY AFTER SCUFFLES BROKE OUT WHERE A TRAIN WAS TO LEAVE FOR VIENNA AND MUNICH. MIGRANTS CHANTING "FREEDOM! FREEDOM!" CONGREGATED OUTSIDE THE STATION AFTER BEING PUSHED OUT. POLICE ACTED AFTER AUTHORITIES ANNOUNCED OVER STATION LOUDSPEAKERS THAT ALL TRAINS WOULD BE STOPPED FROM LEAVING FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD. SCORES OF LOCALS, TOURISTS AND MIGRANTS WITH TRAVEL DOCUMENTS AND TICKETS REMAINED IN THE CAVERNOUS STATION, SOME STARING AT INFORMATION BOARDS STILL SHOWING ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE TIMES. --- 10:55 A.M. UNICEF SAYS THE NUMBER OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN FLEEING THROUGH MACEDONIA HAS TRIPLED IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS. THE U.N.'S CHILDREN'S AGENCY SAID TUESDAY SOME 3,000 PEOPLE ARE PASSING DAILY THROUGH THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC AND ROUGHLY ONE IN EIGHT IS A PREGNANT WOMAN. CITING MACEDONIAN FIGURES, UNICEF SAYS FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THE MIGRANTS COME FROM SYRIA. SINCE JUNE, MORE THAN 52,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED IN THE TOWN OF GEVGELIJA ON THE GREEK BORDER. THE AGENCY SAYS IT IS DISPATCHING SENDING WATER AND HUGE TENTS TO SKOPJE, THE MACEDONIAN CAPITAL. --- 10:45 A.M. GREECE'S COAST GUARD SAYS IT HAS RESCUED NEARLY 1,200 MIGRANTS FROM THE SEA OFF ITS EASTERN AEGEAN ISLANDS IN A SINGLE DAY, AS THE FLOOD OF PEOPLE FLEEING WAR AND POVERTY TO SEEK SHELTER IN THE EUROPEAN UNION CONTINUES UNABATED. THE COAST GUARD SAID TUESDAY IT HAD PICKED UP 1,192 PEOPLE IN 31 SEPARATE SEARCH-AND-RESCUE OPERATIONS FROM MONDAY MORNING TO TUESDAY MORNING OFF THE ISLANDS OF LESBOS, CHIOS, SAMOS, AGATHONISSI, FARMAKONISSI, KOS AND MEGISTI. THAT NUMBER IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE OF LATE, WHICH IS USUALLY IN THE HUNDREDS. THE NUMBERS DO NOT INCLUDE HUNDREDS MORE WHO REACH THE ISLANDS THEMSELVES FROM THE NEARBY TURKISH COAST EACH DAY, USUALLY IN OVERLOADED INFLATABLE DINGHIES.
174	THE BEST INDICATOR THAT THE NATIONAL RECESSION WAS LIFTING IN MEMPHIS WAS THE EMERGENCE THIS YEAR OF NUMEROUS PLANS FOR NEW HOTELS AND MOTELS. THE PLANNED $57 MILLION IN IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MEMPHIS COOK CONVENTION CENTER HAVE RESTARTED A DISCUSSION ABOUT LONGER-TERM PLANS FOR AN EXPANSION THAT COULD INCLUDE TWO NEW RIVERSIDE HOTELS. (FLEMING ARCHITECTS) BUT ASIDE FROM WHITEHAVENS 450-ROOM, $90 MILLION GUEST HOUSE AT GRACELAND, MOST OF THE PLANNED PROJECTS ARE SMALL. AND THE SMALLER HOTELS DO LITTLE TO RESOLVE THE LONG-STANDING CHICKEN-AND-EGG QUESTION ABOUT WHICH SHOULD COME FIRST MORE HOTEL ROOMS OR MORE AND BETTER CONVENTION SPACE. TO SAY THAT WE ARE DOMINATED BY SELECT-SERVICE, LIMITED-SERVICE SMALLER PROPERTIES IN THIS ENTIRE MARKETPLACE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT, MEMPHIS CONVENTION & VISITORS BUREAU PRESIDENT BEHIND THE HEADLINES, HOSTED BY THE DAILY NEWS PUBLISHER THE DOWNTOWN MEMPHIS COMMISSION IS EXPLORING NEW GUIDELINES THAT WOULD PUSH TAX INCENTIVES TO HOTELS THAT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON ATTRACTING LARGE CONVENTIONS AND MEETINGS TO THE CITY. THAT MEANS A DENSER DOWNTOWN. WERE REALIZING THAT WE NEED LARGER HOTELS THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE THESE CONVENTIONS COMING TO MEMPHIS, SAID LESLIE GOWER, THE DMCS MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS VICE PRESIDENT. SHE COUNTS 4,100 HOTEL ROOMS DOWNTOWN THAT IN 2013 GENERATED $250 MILLION IN REVENUE FOR THE CITY. WERE TRYING TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN IN A PARCEL. THATS OUR GOAL DENSITY, GOWER SAID, CITING THE $160 MILLION, TWO-TOWER ONE BEALE PROJECT. ITS 18-STORY TOWER OVERLOOKING RIVERSIDE DRIVE AND THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WILL FEATURE A 255-ROOM HOTEL: WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE ARE PROJECTS THAT BRING A LOT OF PEOPLE INTO TOWERS. KANES CITYWIDE PERSPECTIVE COUNTS 240 HOTELS IN ALL OF SHELBY COUNTY WITH 23,000 ROOMS, BUT ONLY 19 OF THOSE HOTELS HAVE 150 ROOMS OR MORE. ANOTHER FIVE HAVE AT LEAST 300 ROOMS AND THERE IS ONLY ONE HOTEL WITH MORE THAN 500 THE 603-ROOM SHERATON MEMPHIS DOWNTOWN THATS CONNECTED TO THE MEMPHIS COOK CONVENTION CENTER. I WOULD RATHER HAVE ONE, 500-ROOM PROPERTY THAN 10, 100-ROOM PROPERTIES, KANE SAID. USUALLY THE LARGER PROPERTIES HAVE LARGER SALES FORCES. THEY HAVE LOTS OF MEETING SPACE. THEY BRING BUSINESS TO THE MARKET VERSUS JUST SPREADING BUSINESS AROUND. ONE WAY TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE ROOM-COUNT DENSITY WOULD BE A WESTWARD EXPANSION OF THE EXISTING CONVENTION CENTER TOWARD THE MEMPHIS HARBOR AND MISSISSIPPI RIVER. WE HAVE THE FOOTPRINT THERE ON CITY-OWNED PROPERTY TO DO A MAJOR EXPANSION OF SOMETHING OF THE MAGNITUDE OF A MUSIC CITY CENTER IN NASHVILLE THAT WOULD BE CONNECTED TO OUR EXISTING CONVENTION CENTER, KANE SAID. AND ON THAT FOOTPRINT, WE HAVE ROOM FOR TWO LARGER HOTELS IF WE CAN FIND THE HOTEL PARTNERS. SUCH AN EXPANSION OVER AND UNDER EXISTING INTERSTATE RAMPS, WHICH WOULD ADD 2,000 RIVERFRONT HOTEL ROOMS, IS STILL TENTATIVE AND AT LEAST 10 YEARS IN THE FUTURE. ITS ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A SMALLER-SCALE RENOVATION STILL IN THE PLANNING STAGES. A HIKE IN THE LOCAL HOTEL-MOTEL BED TAX FINANCE WILL FINANCE MOST OF THAT $57 MILLION RENOVATION. IN 10 YEARS, 15 YEARS, THE WHOLE WORLD CHANGES, KANE SAID OF THE PLANS TO PUSH TO THE RIVERS EDGE. WE MAY DECIDE WE NEED A CONVENTION CENTER IN ANOTHER PART OF TOWN. BUT THE WILLINGNESS OF KANE AND OTHER CIVIC LEADERS TO UNVEIL THE $57 MILLION RENOVATION PROJECT, AS WELL AS A FUTURE GLIMPSE OF THE MUCH LARGER EXPANSION, REFLECTS A VIEW THAT STAYING PUT IS PREFERABLE TO RELOCATING. WE HAVE SAID IF WE CAN IMPROVE THIS CONVENTION CENTER AND MAKE IT VERY COMPETITIVE THE WAY IT IS NOW, IT WOULD BE MORE REASONABLE FOR US IN THE LONG TERM TO EXPAND WHERE WE ARE INSTEAD OF GOING TO A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LOCATION AND HAVING TO FIND A NEW USE LIKE WE DID AT THE PYRAMID.
175	THE OPENING DAY OF THE SAN MARINO GRAND PRIX SAW MIXED EMOTIONS FOR THE DRIVE M7 SIC RACING TEAM, WITH BOTH RIDERS EXPERIENCING A DIFFERENT START TO PROCEEDINGS. FEELING IN GOOD FORM ZULFAHMI KHAIRUDDIN PROGRESSIVELY BUILT HIS SPEED THROUGHOUT MORNING PRACTICE, POSTING HIS QUICKEST TIME ON HIS LAST LAP AND CONCLUDING THE SESSION IN 20TH POSITION. FREE PRACTICE TWO SAW THE MALAYSIAN RIDER CONTINUE TO PICK UP THE PACE AS HE FOCUSSED ON FURTHER ADAPTING HIS RIDING STYLE AROUND THE 4.2KM CIRCUIT. MAKING GOOD PROGRESS KHAIRUDDIN COMPLETED THE AFTERNOONS SESSION IN A RESPECTABLE 17TH PLACE, JUST 1.482S FROM FIRST PLACE MAN DANNY KENT. ALSO USING THE UPGRADED KTM CHASSIS, JAKUB KORNFEIL EXPERIENCED A DIFFERENT START TO HIS WEEKEND, AS HE RELENTLESSLY BATTLED WITH THE NEW SET-UP OF HIS #84 MACHINE. DESPITE HIS DETERMINED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE, THE CZECH RIDER WAS OVERCOME WITH TECHNICAL ISSUES, ENDING THE DAY IN 28TH POSITION. BIKE #63 ZULFAHMI KHAIRUDDIN FP1: P20; 145.072 (DRY) 19 LAPS FP2: P17; 144.579 (DRY) 17 LAPS I THINK TODAY WE CAN BE HAPPY WITH THE BIKE BECAUSE IN THE SECOND PRACTICE I FELT A BIG IMPROVEMENT FROM FP1. STILL WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE SET-UP, SO HOPEFULLY TOMORROW WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE ANOTHER STEP. WE ARE LOOKING FOR AT LEAST ONE SECOND MORE BECAUSE WE KNOW EVERYONE WILL GO FASTER AGAIN. MY MAIN DIFFICULTY TODAY WAS TURN TWELVE, WHICH IS WHERE I LOST THE MOST TIME, SO I WILL HAVE A LOOK AT THE DATA AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO GO FASTER, BUT FOR SURE ONE SECOND IS NECESSARY. BIKE #84 JAKUB KORNFEIL FP1: P16; 144.942 (DRY) 17 LAPS FP2: P28; 145.145 (DRY) 16 LAPS TODAY I MADE ONLY ONE FAST LAP WHICH WAS AT THE END OF THE FIRST PRACTICE, THE REST OF THE TIME WE WERE JUST TRYING TO FIND OURSELVES IN A BETTER CONDITION. OF COURSE I WANTED TO BE MUCH FASTER BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE. THIS WEEKEND WE HAVE AN UPGRADE FROM KTM, A NEW FRAME AND A NEW SWING-ARM BUT UNFORTUNATELY ITS NOT WORKING FOR US AT THE MOMENT. WE NEED MORE TIME TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE BIKE; TODAY WE TRIED EVERYTHING FOR THE AFTERNOON PRACTICE BUT STILL WE COULDNT MAKE ANY PROGRESS. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT WE HAD; WE ALSO HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE CLUTCH AND POSSIBLY SOMETHING WITH THE ENGINE, SO WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS AND WHY MY BIKE DOESNT WANT TO STOP. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE MUST LOOK INTO; FOR TOMORROW WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING. NOW WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER WITH KTM TO FIND A SOLUTION. THE TIME THAT I DID TODAY WAS MY MAXIMUM BUT I KNOW WE ARE CAPABLE OF MUCH MORE. TOMORROW WE HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE BEFORE THE QUALIFYING AND THEN IN THE QUALIFYING WE HAVE TO BE WITHIN OUR TARGET OF THE TOP FOUR ROWS. THIS IS OUR FOCUS AND THIS IS WHAT WE WILL BE WORKING EVEN HARDER FOR.

176	BY BY | REUTERS BY COLLEEN JENKINS (REUTERS) - A MAN SUSPECTED OF GUNNING DOWN A MISSISSIPPI COLLEGE PROFESSOR AND KILLING HIS LIVE-IN GIRLFRIEND BEFORE TAKING HIS OWN LIFE LEFT BEHIND A NOTE APOLOGISING FOR HIS ACTIONS, POLICE SAID ON TUESDAY. BUT A POLICE OFFICIAL SAID SHANNON LAMB, A SOCIAL SCIENCE AND GEOGRAPHY INSTRUCTOR AT DELTA STATE UNIVERSITY, GAVE NO MOTIVE FOR THE KILLINGS THAT PROMPTED A TENSE MANHUNT ON MONDAY BEFORE HE SHOT HIMSELF AS HE WAS CORNERED BY AUTHORITIES. POLICE SAID LAMB, 45, SHOT AND KILLED AMY PRENTISS, 41, AT THE HOME THEY SHARED IN GAUTIER, MISSISSIPPI BEFORE DRIVING 300 MILES (480 KM) TO DELTA STATE, WHERE HE FATALLY SHOT COLLEAGUE ETHAN SCHMIDT, AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF AMERICAN HISTORY. "VERY SORRY," READ THE HANDWRITTEN NOTE SIGNED BY LAMB. "I WISH I COULD TAKE IT BACK. I LOVED AMY AND SHE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO EVER LOVED ME." AFTER ARRIVING MONDAY MORNING AT THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN CLEVELAND, MISSISSIPPI, LAMB CALLED POLICE TO REPORT THAT HE HAD KILLED PRENTISS THE NIGHT BEFORE, GAUTIER POLICE OFFICER MATT HOGGATT TOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE. CLEVELAND POLICE CHIEF CHARLES "BUSTER" BINGHAM PREVIOUSLY SAID IT DID NOT APPEAR THE SHOOTING VICTIMS KNEW EACH OTHER. "WE DON'T KNOW WHY THIS MAN DID WHAT HE DID," HE SAID. THE UNIVERSITY CANCELLED EVENTS TO COMMEMORATE ITS 90TH ANNIVERSARY AND INSTEAD PLANNED A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL TO HONOUR SCHMIDT ON TUESDAY NIGHT. SCHMIDT'S DEATH FOLLOWED SIMILAR INCIDENTS ON U.S. COLLEGE CAMPUSES IN RECENT WEEKS, INCLUDING AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA, TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY AND GEORGIA'S SAVANNAH STATE UNIVERSITY. WHILE ON THE RUN MONDAY, LAMB MADE STATEMENTS TO FAMILY REMEMBERS THAT WERE RELAYED TO POLICE THAT HE WOULD NOT TURN HIMSELF IN, HOGGATT SAID. AFTER GREENVILLE POLICE SPOTTED LAMB'S CAR AND BEGAN TO FOLLOW HIM, HE JUMPED FROM THE VEHICLE AND RAN, LAW ENFORCEMENT SAID. OFFICERS THEN HEARD A GUNSHOT. POLICE LOCKED DOWN THE DELTA STATE CAMPUS AND SEARCHED BUILDINGS ON MONDAY AFTER THE REPORTS OF GUNFIRE. DELTA STATE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT WILLIAM LAFORGE PRAISED SCHMIDT, 39, A MARRIED FATHER OF THREE CHILDREN, AS A "STAR" PROFESSOR. "I THOUGHT THE WORLD OF HIM," LAFORGE SAID. LAFORGE SAID LAMB WAS TEACHING TWO ONLINE COURSES DURING THE FALL SEMESTER AND DID NOT WANT A FULL LOAD, CITING MEDICAL ISSUES.

177	DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, LATELY IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS (LETS CALL THEM RAOUL AND CHRISTINE, FOR CONVENIENCES SAKE) THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND RECENTLY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP. IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT CLOSE TO TEN YEARS AND I CONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP. RAOUL, IVE KNOWN FOR ALMOST AS LONG, BUT WE LIVE IN THE SAME CITY AND HANG OUT OCCASIONALLY. THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES.

CHRISTINE AND I HAD A FALLING OUT SOME TIME AGO AND ONLY RECENTLY RCONNECTED. DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST. ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN THOUGH RAOUL IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, I HAVE GOTTEN TO SEE A LOT OF HIS BAD SIDE (PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, SINCE I DONT TRUST MYSELF TO NOT BE BIASED), INCLUDING HIS (SEEMING) UNWILLINGNESS TO BE AFFECTIONATE EVEN IN A RELATIONSHIP HE INITIATES. IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS.  ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?). I KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME; I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THAT. BUT I JUST CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. PART OF ME WONDERS IF IM BEING TOO CLINGY ABOUT THIS? ITS THEIR LIVES AND I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO GET IT IN PRACTICE. ANOTHER PART WONDERS IF IM BEING UNFAIR TO RAOUL? MYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR THEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE. IVE THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW IM NOT AS BOTHERED AS I WAS INITIALLY. UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PRT BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH. I STILL CANT FULLY COME TO TERMS WITH IT AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS BETTER THAN THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY I CANT JUST LIVE AND LET LIVE? WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO?

179	THE WITHDRAWAL CAME SIX WEEKS AFTER THE FINAL U.S. CLEARANCE AND THREE MONTHS AFTER SHELL WAS STILL DEFENDING THE PROJECT, A RAPID CHANGE OF HEART FOR SUCH A LARGE COMPANY THAT SHOWED IT IS PREPARING FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF LOW OIL PRICES WHILE TRYING TO CLOSE ITS $70 BILLION TAKEOVER OF RIVAL BG. SHELL HAS SPENT ABOUT $7 BILLION ON EXPLORATION IN THE WATERS OFF ALASKA SO FAR AND SAID IT COULD TAKE A HIT OF UP TO $4.1 BILLION FOR PULLING OUT OF THE TREACHEROUS CHUKCHI SEA, WHERE ICEBERGS CAN BE AS LARGE AS NEW YORK'S MANHATTAN ISLAND. THE UNSUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN IS SHELL'S SECOND MAJOR SETBACK IN THE ARCTIC AFTER IT INTERRUPTED EXPLORATION FOR THREE YEARS IN 2012 WHEN AN ENORMOUS DRILLING RIG BROKE FREE AND RAN AGROUND. ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNERS AND SHAREHOLDERS HAVE ALSO PRESSURED SHELL TO DROP ARCTIC DRILLING. SOME ARE WORRIED AN OIL SPILL WOULD HARM PROTECTED SPECIES WHILE OTHERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST AFTER OIL PRICES MORE THAN HALVED IN A YEAR. SHELL SAID THE DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE AREA REFLECTED POOR RESULTS FROM ITS BURGER J EXPLORATORY WELL, THE PROJECT'S HIGH COSTS AND THE UNPREDICTABLE FEDERAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN THE AREA OFF THE U.S. STATE OF ALASKA. A SHELL SOURCE SAID THE COMPANY HAD FOUND U.S. REGULATION VERY PRESCRIPTIVE AND IN SOME CASES CONTRADICTORY, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THE REGULATORY PROCESS. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION DEALT A BLOW TO SHELL IN JUNE, RULING THAT LAWS PROTECTING WALRUS AND POLAR BEARS PREVENTED SHELL FROM DRILLING TWO RIGS SIMULTANEOUSLY AT CLOSE RANGE. "THE ENTIRE EPISODE HAS BEEN A VERY COSTLY ERROR FOR THE COMPANY BOTH FINANCIALLY AND REPUTATIONALLY," SAID ANALYSTS AT DEUTSCHE BANK, WHO ESTIMATE THE SHELL'S ARCTIC EXPLORATION PROJECT COULD COST THE COMPANY ABOUT $9 BILLION. ARCTIC CASUALTIES ENVIRONMENTALISTS, WHO HAVE CRITICIZED SHELL'S DRILLING PLANS IN AN AREA THAT IS HOME TO POPULATIONS OF WHALES, WALRUS AND POLAR BEARS, CLAIMED VICTORY. IN JULY, ACTIVISTS TRIED TO STOP AN ICEBREAKER KEY TO SHELL'S DRILLING PLANS FROM LEAVING PORT BY DANGLING FROM A BRIDGE. ANNIE LEONARD, HEAD OF GREENPEACE USA, SAID SHELL'S DECISION WAS "PROOF POSITIVE THAT DRILLING IN THE ARCTIC IS TOO COSTLY TO BE EFFECTIVE AND A BAD BET FOR OTHER ENERGY COMPANIES." THE DECISION IS ALSO THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF SETBACKS FOR PROJECTS IN THE ARCTIC TO FIND OIL AND GAS DEPOSITS ESTIMATED AT 20 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S UNDISCOVERED RESOURCES. EARLIER THIS YEAR, NORWAY'S STATOIL POSTPONED ITS ARCTIC JOHAN CASTBERG PROJECT AGAIN AND IN 2012 RUSSIA'S GAZPROM, TOGETHER WITH TOTAL AND STATOIL, SCRAPPED THE SHTOKMAN GAS PROJECT IN THE ARCTIC BARENTS SEA. "ARCTIC EXPLORATION HAS BEEN A CLEAR CASUALTY OF THE OIL PRICE SLUMP," SAID PETER KIERNAN, OIL AND GAS ANALYST AT THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT. OIL FIRMS HAVE DROPPED COSTLY OFFSHORE PROJECTS WORLDWIDE AS WEAK OIL PRICES HAVE EATEN INTO BUDGETS. THESE INCLUDE BP'S DECISION TO REVIEW INVESTMENT PLANS FOR THE DEEPWATER MAD DOG 2 PROJECT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND HUSKY ENERGY'S DELAY TO AN EXTENSION OF ITS WEST WHITE ROSE FIELD OFF CANADA. "ALASKA BEEN A BONE OF CONTENTION FOR MANY INVESTORS THUS TODAY'S UPDATE IS A POSITIVE," SAID BERNSTEIN ANALYSTS, WHO RATE SHELL'S STOCK AS OUTPERFORM. SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI, AN ALASKAN REPUBLICAN, SAID SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED BY THE DECISION. THE U.S. INTERIOR DEPARTMENT "PLACED SIGNIFICANT LIMITS ON THIS SEASON'S ACTIVITIES, WHICH RESULTED IN A DRILLING RIG SITTING IDLE," SHE SAID. SHELL'S LONDON-LISTED SHARES MOVED UP IN EARLY TRADING BUT LATER FELL MORE THAN 2.8 PERCENT. SHELL SAID ITS ALASKAN PROJECT WAS VALUED AT ABOUT $3 BILLION ON ITS BALANCE SHEET AND THAT IT HAD A $1.1 BILLION IN FUTURE CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS. IT SAID IT WOULD GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE COST OF WRITEDOWNS WITH THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS.
180	THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. ALL THATS CREATED A NEW PUSH FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO MECHANIZATION TO REPLACE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME FILLING. THERES AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF FRESH-MARKET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS, MATTHEW WHITING , AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND EXTENSION SPECIALIST AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEET CHERRY INDUSTRY, TELLS THE SALT. THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED HARVEST LABOR IS ON EVERY GROWERS MIND. FOR LABOR DAY, WE THOUGHT WED ROUND UP SOME OF THE CROPS THAT CANT YET BE HARVESTED BY A MACHINE, BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE FUTURE. TO BE CLEAR, THE ISSUE OF FARM LABOR IS COMPLICATED. AND MACHINES THAT COULD HARVEST THESE CROPS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE GOOD MFOR EVERYONE. SWEET CHERRIES THESE ARE THE SOFT, SWEET CHERRIES WE GET IN BAGS WITH THE STEM ATTACHED. AND WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND PLUMP? BECAUSE A HUMAN HAND CAREFULLY PICKED THEM. BUT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER WILLING HANDS TO DO THAT WORK. AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTICED. OF ALL YTHE PRODUCERS THAT DREAM OF MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO EASE THEIR LABOR WOES, THE SWEET CHERRY GROWERS MIGHT BE THE CLOSEST TO GETTING ONE THANKS TO RESEARCH FUNDING. MATT WHITING SAYS HE AND OTHERS AT WSU ARE CLOSE TO FINDING A COMMERCIAL PARTNER FOR A PROTOTYPE HARVESTER THAT CAN PICK 50 TIMES AS MANY CHERRIES AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD IN THE SAME TIME. STILL, THERES ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS NEW MODEL IS VIABLE: NEW VARIETIES OF CHERRIES SUITED TO THE MECHANICAL HARVESTER WILL NEED TO BE BRED. WHITING SAYS RESEARCH IS HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT IN 10 TO 12 YEARS, SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER GROWERS A SUITE OF NEW VARIETIES. ASPARAGUS AS THE HUFFINGTON POST HAS REPORTED , ASPARAGUS IS UNIQUELY LABOR INTENSIVE BECAUSE THE QUICK-GROWING PLANT MUST BE HARVESTED EVERY DAY OF ITS THREE-MONTH GROWING SEASON. EACH PLANT SPROUTS MULTIPLE SPEARS (THE PART OF THE PLANT WE EAT) A DAY, WHICH HAVE TO BE HAND-CUT EVERY DAY. SO THAT MEANS WORKERS ARE CUTTING 14 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FROM ROUGHLY FEBRUARY TO MAY. BUT VARIOUS MECHANICAL ASPARAGUS HARVESTERS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING THEM. ACCORDING TO A 2009 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT , IF THE U.S. ASPARAGUS INDUSTRY IS TO INSURE A COMPETITIVE POSITION, IT MUST SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGY FOR LABOR TO LOWER PER UNIT COSTS AND SHIFT THE WORKFORCE TO VALUE-ADDED EMPLOYMENT. INSTITUTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW. APPLES COMMERCIAL APPLE PICKING TODAY REQUIRES BRAWN WORKERS HAVE TO FILL BUCKETS ALL DAY LONG WITH HEAVY APPLES AND THEN DUMP THEM INTO BINS. AND ACCORDING TO A FRUIT INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION , THE ERA OF FULLY AUTOMATED ROBOTIC HARVESTERS NAVIGATING [APPLE] ORCHARD ROWS IS STILL YEARS AWAY. WHITING SAYS THATS BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS DEDICATED LITTLE FUNDING DEDICATED TO RESEARCH. THATS CHANGING, THOUGH. THE WASHINGTON STATE TREE FRUIT RESEARCH COMMISSION IS NOW PURSUING MORE RESEARCH ON MECHANICAL HARVESTING. AND THIS YEAR, SOME COMMERCIAL APPLE FARMERS MAY BE USING A VACUUM HARVESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME. ITS DESIGNERS SAY IT SAVES TIME, REDUCES PICKER FATIGUE AND BOOST THE HARVEST YIELD. PEPPERS CALIFORNIA GROWS ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE PEPPERS IN THE U.S., AND LATELY THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION HAS BEEN TALKING MORE DEVELOPING MECHANICAL HARVESTING AND VARIETIES BRED TO BE PICKED BY MACHINES. ACCORDING TO A 2015 REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION, WITH INCREASING COST AND DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF LABOR NEEDED TO PICK PEPPERS, INNOVATION [SIMILAR TO THE PROCESSED TOMATO INDUSTRY] COULD GIVE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. FARMERS SIGNIFICANT RETURNS AND POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PEPPER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA, THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO HAVE FRESH MARKET QUALITY AND MECHANICAL HARVESTING IN BOTH BLOCKY [BELL PEPPERS] AND HOT TYPES. SHARE THIS EACH DAY WE SEE THE EFFORT OF UNIONS TO FORCE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY FARM WORKERS TO PAY BRIBES TO WORK. THEN YOU HAVE THE EFFORT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES ARE FORCING WORKERS TO SPEND MORE ON WORKING CONDITIONS. THEN YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR FARMS, ESPECIALLY IF A NEW PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. THE SOLUTION IS ROBOTS AND MACHINES TO DO THE PICKING AND HARVESTING OF CROPS. WHILE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE NEW MACHINES, THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SO. YEARS AGO UC DAVIS DEVELOPED A TOMATO PICKING MACHINEBUT THE UNIONS STOPPED ITS DEVELOPMENT. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. AGAIN, AMERICA CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN AGRICULTURE INTERNATIONALLY. WE CAN INNOVATE AND FEED THE HUNGRY MASSES BY MAKING FOOD AVAILABILITY MORE RELIABLE AND LOW COST. 4 LABOR-INTENSIVE CROPS FARMERS WISH THEY HAD ROBOTS TO HARVEST ELIZA BARCLAY, KPBS, 9/7/15 THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION SAYS MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO PICK HOT AND BELL PEPPERS COULD HELP SOLVE LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEMS. IF YOURE ENJOYING A LATE-SUMMER FRUIT PIE THIS LBABOR DAY, CONSIDER WHAT WENT INTO GROWING AND HARVESTING THAT FRUIT. CHANCES ARE, IT TOOK A LOT OF HUMAN HANDS TO ENSURE ITS SKIN WOULD BE PERFECT AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. WHILE MACHINES HAVE REPLACED HUMAN HANDS FOR A LOT OF FARM JOBS THE HARVESTING OF TOMATOES FOR PROCESSING, THE CUTTING OF LETTUCE AND SPINACH, THE SHAKING OF ALMOND TREES TO MAKE THE NUTS FALL TO THE GROUND MANY FRUIT, VEGETABLE AND NUT FARMERS STILL RELY HEAVILY ON PEOPLE TO PLANT, MAINTAIN AND HARVEST THEIR CROPS. MACHINES DONT YET EXIST FOR THESE CROPS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN AMPLE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK, AND BECAUSE ITS HARD TO DESIGN MACHINES THAT CAN CUT OR PICK THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLES WITHOUT SQUISHING OR DAMAGING THEM TOO MUCH.  HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT.
181	TORONTO: ONCE AGAIN, CANADA RANKS AMONG THE WORLDS MOST ECONOMICALLY FREE COUNTRIES, RANKING NINTH OVERALL ACCORDING TO THE FRASER INSTITUTES ANNUAL ECONOMIC FREEDOM OF THE WORLD REPORT. THE REPORT MEASURES THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM (LEVELS OF PERSONAL CHOICE, ABILITY TO ENTER MARKETS, SECURITY OF PRIVATELY OWNED PROPERTY, RULE OF LAW, ETC.) BY ANALYZING THE POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF 157 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES. ECONOMIC FREEDOM BREEDS PROSPERITY AND ECONOMICALLY FREE COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA OFFER THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF LIFE WHILE THE LOWEST-RANKED COUNTRIES ARE USUALLY BURDENED BY OPPRESSIVE REGIMES THAT LIMIT THE FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY OF THEIR CITIZENS, SAID FRED MCMAHON, DR. MICHAEL A. WALKER RESEARCH CHAIR IN ECONOMIC FREEDOM WITH THE FRASER INSTITUTE. CANADA DROPPED TWO SPOTS IN THIS YEARS RANKINGS, TO NINTH FROM SEVENTH. THE UNITED STATES, ONCE CONSIDERED A BASTION OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, RANKS 16TH IN THE WORLD. A WEAKENED RULE OF LAW, THE SO-CALLED WARS ON TERRORISM AND DRUGS, AND A CONFUSED REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HAVE HELPED ERODE ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH REMAINS BEHIND CANADA AND OTHER MORE ECONOMICALLY FREE COUNTRIES SUCH AS QATAR, JORDAN AND THE U.A.E., MCMAHON SAID ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, BASED ON 2013 STATISTICS (THE MOST RECENT YEAR OF AVAILABLE DATA), THE TOP 10 MOST ECONOMICALLY FREE JURISDICTIONS ARE HONG KONG (WHICH CONTINUES ITS STREAK OF NUMBER ONE RANKINGS), SINGAPORE, NEW ZEALAND, SWITZERLAND, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, MAURITIUS, JORDAN, IRELAND AND CANADA, WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CHILE TIED FOR 10TH. HONG KONG REMAINS NUMBER ONE BUT BECAUSE DEMOCRACY IS THE BEST SAFEGUARD OF FREEDOM, IF CHINA, WHICH RANKS LOW IN ECONOMIC FREEDOM, ENCROACHES ON HONG KONG, WE CAN EXPECT HONG KONGS RANKING TO FALL, MCMAHON SAID. OTHER NOTABLE RANKINGS INCLUDE JAPAN (26), GERMANY (29), RUSSIA (99), CHINA (111) AND INDIA (114). THE 10 LOWEST-RANKED COUNTRIES ARE ANGOLA, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, ZIMBABWE, ALGERIA, ARGENTINA, SYRIA, CHAD, LIBYA, REPUBLIC OF CONGO, AND VENEZUELA. SOME DESPOTIC COUNTRIES SUCH AS NORTH KOREA AND CUBA CANT BE RANKED DUE TO LACK OF DATA. GLOBALLY, THE AVERAGE ECONOMIC FREEDOM SCORE ROSE SLIGHTLY TO 6.86 OUT OF 10 FROM 6.84 LAST YEAR. ACCORDING TO RESEARCH IN TOP PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS, PEOPLE LIVING IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM ENJOY GREATER PROSPERITY, MORE POLITICAL AND CIVIL LIBERTIES, AND LONGER LIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, COUNTRIES IN THE TOP QUARTILE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM HAD AN AVERAGE PER-CAPITA GDP OF US$38,601 IN 2013, COMPARED TO US$6,986 FOR BOTTOM QUARTILE NATIONS.

184	GET AUTOGUIDE.COM IN YOUR INBOX LIKE AUTOGUIDE.COM ON FACEBOOK IN ORDER TO SHAKE UP THE LARGE SEDAN SEGMENT, NISSAN HAD TO SHOW OFF ITS EXPERTISE IN SEVERAL KEY ASPECTS. HERES WHAT WHAT REALLY STANDS OUTIN THE BRAND NEW 2016 NISSAN MAXIMA. FAST FACTS ENGINE: 3.5-LITER V6, 300 HP, 261 LB-FT TRANSMISSION: CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE AUTOMATIC PRICE: BASE, $33,235; AS TESTED, $40,685 (INCLUDING $825 IN DESTINATION FEES) FUEL ECONOMY: 22 CITY, 30 HIGHWAY, 25 COMBINED 1. DESIGN BORROWS FROM THE BEST IN THE BIZ THE 2016 NISSAN MAXIMA IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST LOOKING GENERATION OF THE SEDAN. SITTING 1.3 INCHES LOWER AND 2.2 INCHES LONGER, IT LOOKS MUCH LEANER THAN PAST MODELS, AND IS EASILY ONE OF SPORTIEST LOOKING CARS IN ITS SEGMENTS. MY FAVORITE ELEMENT OF THE EXTERIOR DESIGN IS THE APPEARANCE OF A FLOATING ROOF, ACHIEVED BY BLACKING OUT THE A-PILLAR AND A PORTION OF THE C-PILLAR. THE PLATINUM TRIM MODEL TESTED ALSO FEATURES TASTEFUL CHROME ACCENTS ON THE GRILLE AND REAR BUMPER, AND CHROME DOOR HANDLES. IM GLAD NISSAN DIDNT GO OVERBOARD WITH THE CHROME, AS THAT CAN MAKE A CAR LOOK TACKY AND CHEAP. I ALSO LOVE THE LOOK OF THE LED DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS THAT CREATE AN EASY TO RECOGNIZE FRONT PROFILE. THE BULGES AND FLARED WHEEL ARCHES ALSO HELP MAKE THE CAR STAND OUT AS SOMETHING THATS A BIT SPORTIER THAN OTHER LARGE SEDANS AND REMINISCENT OF THE MAZDA6. 2. INTERIOR DESIGN IMPRESSES EVEN WITH ITS SLICK EXTERIOR DESIGN, THE INTERIOR OF THIS MAXIMA IS WHAT REALLY STANDS OUT, SPECIFICALLY THE QUILTED PATTERNED LEATHER SEATS, A SURPRISING DETAIL TO SEE IN THIS SEGMENT. THE FRONT HALF OF THE CABIN IS SET UP NICELY, SURROUNDING THE FRONT TWO PASSENGERS AS IF THEYRE IN THEIR OWN POD SEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER. THE SEATS PROVED TO BE VERY COMFORTABLE OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL LONG TRIPS DURING MY WEEK OF TESTING. DESCRIBED AS ZERO GRAVITY SEATS, THEY WERE ALSO OUTFITTED WITH HEATED AND COOLED FUNCTIONS, THE LATTER OF WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY USEFUL DURING THIS HOT AND STICKY SUMMER. 3. FIT AND FINISH OF LUXURY GRADE ALSO NOTEABLE IS THE INTERIOR FIT AND FINISH IN ADDITION TO THE FANTASTIC MIX OF MATERIALS. FOR STARTERS, THE KNOBS AND SWITCHGEAR ARE REALLY HIGH QUALITY AND BORDER ON LUXURY CAR TERRITORY. WE COMPARED THE MAXIMA TO THE HYUNDAI GENESIS SEDAN, A VEHICLE THATS CLEARLY TARGETTING THE LUXURY CAR SEGMENT, AND THE NISSAN HAD NOTHING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT AGAINST THE HYUNDAI. IN FACT, LOOKING AT SOME OF THE ACCENTS INSIDE THE MAXIMA WILL SPUR YOUR IMAGINATION. THE WOOD TRIM HAS A THREE-DIMENSIONAL ASPECT TO IT, ANGLED TO SHOW OFF THE DETAILS A BIT MORE. 4. TECHNOLOGY IS ITS MIDDLE NAME NISSAN IS PACKING THE MAXIMA WITH NEARLY AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF COOL TECHNOLOGY. TAKE THE EIGHT-INCH INFOTAINMENT SCREEN, THAT IS CONTROLLABLE VIA A RESPONSIVE TOUCH SCREEN AND A KNOB ON THE CENTER CONSOLE BY THE GEAR SELECTOR. ITS A SMALL THING THAT HELPS MAKE THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM EASIER TO USE WHILE DRIVING. OF COURSE. THE MAXIMA IS LOADED WITH MORE TECHNOLOGY THAN JUST THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM. THERES SAFETY FEATURES LIKE A FORWARD COLLISION WARNING, FORWARD EMERGENCY BRAKING, REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT AND BLIND SPOT WARNING. THERES ALSO DRIVER ASSISTS LIKE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL AND A 360-DEGREE CAMERA. VERY LITTLE HAS BEEN LEFT OUT AND IT ALL WORKED VERY WELL TO MAKE THE CAR FEEL LIKE A REALLY WELL PACKAGED VEHICLE. 5. ENGINE A SWEET SPOT THE 3.5-LITER V6 ENGINE FOUND UNDER THE HOOD OF THE MAXIMA MAY BE FAMILIAR, BUT IS VERY HEAVILY REVISED WITH 60-PERCENT NEW PARTS. MAKING 300 HP AND 261 LB-FT OF TORQUE, THE OUTPUT IS ADEQUATE AND THE ENGINE RESPONSIVE, BUT THE MOST EXCITING PART OF THE MOTOR IS JUST HOW NICE IT SOUNDS. NISSAN FANS WILL EASILY RECOGNIZE THE HOWL OF A VQ ENGINE, AND THE MAXIMA CERTAINLY HAS THAT VOCAL PERSONALITY. 6. CVT ISNT A DIRTY WORD THAT ENGINE IS MATED TO NISSANS XTRONIC CVT, A TRANSMISSION THATS KNOWN FOR SUCKING THE FUN OUT OF POTENT CARS. FORTUNATELY IN THIS CASE, THE CVT IS VERY QUICK TO ADJUST ITS GEAR RATIO TO DELIVER SWIFT ACCELERATION WHEN NEEDED AND THRIFTY FUEL ECONOMY WHEN YOU TAKE IT EASY ON THE THROTTLE. A HANDY FEATURE IS THE SPORT BUTTON. AS SOON AS YOU PUT THE MAXIMA IN THIS MODE, THE TRANSMISSION PRETENDS TO BE A CONVENTIONAL AUTO, AND CHANGES GEARS BETWEEN PRE-SET GEAR RATIOS, MAKING THE CAR FEEL FAR MORE EXCITING THAN ITS CVT WOULD SUGGEST IN THE NORMAL MODE. 7. 4DSC MAY BE A BIT MUCH BUT ITS NOT FAR OFF YOU MAY HEAR NISSAN CALL ITS BIG SEDAN 4DSC, OR THE FOUR-DOOR SPORTS CAR. THIS IS A NICKNAME THE COMPANY USED ON THE MAXIMA SINCE 1989, WHEN THE MAXIMA PACKED A 190-HP 3.0-LITER V6 ENGINE. NOW, DESPITE THE MAXIMA WEIGHING IN UNDER 3,600 LBS, THE CAR STILL FEELS RELATIVELY SPORTY. ITS HEAVY STEERING WHEEL PROVIDED A CONFIDENT FEEL ON THE ROAD, AND EVEN HAD SOME FEEDBACK, UNLIKE OTHER MODERN CARS THAT ARE VERY ARTIFICIAL IN TERMS OF FEEL. WHILE THE CAR IS RELATIVELY LIGHTWEIGHT, THE STEERING ENGAGING AND THE POWERTRAIN RESPONSIVE, DONT GET TOO CARRIED AWAY WITH THE 4DSC CLAIMS. THIS IS STILL A LARGE CAR AND DOESNT QUITE FEEL LIKE IT CAN CARVE CANYONS LIKE A SPORTS CAR. 8. FUEL ECONOMY IS SUPERB WHILE THE CAR IS EXCITING TO DRIVE IN THE SPORT MODE, THE CVT HELPS THE 300-HP SEDAN STRETCH OUT ITS FUEL TANK. A LONG DRIVE ROUTE THAT INVOLVED BOTH HIGHWAY AND SUBURBAN DRIVING SAW THE MAXIMA NET 26 MPG. ON A LONGER HIGHWAY DRIVE, THE MAXIMA SURPRISED FURTHER, EASILY GETTING OVER 30 MPG. IF FUEL ECONOMY IN YOUR FULL-SIZE SEDAN IS A CONCERN AND YOU DONT WANT A HYBRID THE MAXIMA SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST. 9. PRICE STARTING AT $33,235, THE BASE MAXIMA IS A LARGE SEDAN THAT IS REFINED AND WELL EQUIPPED. OPT TO GET THE PLATINUM MODEL WE TESTED AND YOULL SPEND JUST $40,685 FOR A CAR THAT EASILY KEEPS UP WITH PREMIUM GRADE VEHICLES FROM ACURA AND BUICK.

186	ALL TIMES EASTERN SEPT. 5: AUBURN VS. LOUISVILLE IN ATLANTA (3:30 P.M., CBS) - IT'S SEC VS. ACC IN ONE OF THOSE FIRST-WEEK-NEUTRAL-SITE-KICKOFF GAMES AT THE GEORGIA DOME. AUBURN IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO ATLANTA TO TURN THE NEUTRAL SITE INTO A HOME GAME. AND THE SEC TOOK A BEATING IN HEAD-TO-HEADS WITH THE ACC LAST SEASON. GEORGIA LOST TO GEORGIA TECH. SOUTH CAROLINA LOST TO CLEMSON. KENTUCKY LOST TO LOUISVILLE. WITH NATIONAL TITLE HOPES, AUBURN WILL WANT TO START THE SEASON ON THE RIGHT FOOT. SEPT. 7: OHIO STATE AT VIRGINIA TECH (8 P.M., ESPN) - REMEMBER A YEAR AGO WHEN THE HOKIES INVADED COLUMBUS AND UPSET THE BUCKEYES? SEEMS LIKE A MIRAGE NOW. OHIO STATE RESPONDED WITH 13 STRAIGHT VICTORIES, INCLUDING THREE STRAIGHT POSTSEASON WINS TO TAKE THE NATIONAL TITLE. THE RETURN MATCHUP IS IN BLACKSBURG AND IT IS DOUBTFUL FRANK BEAMER CAN PULL THE UPSET TWO YEARS IN A ROW. BUT IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO WATCH HIM TRY. SEPT. 12: OREGON AT MICHIGAN STATE (NOON, ABC) - THE TWO TEAMS PLAYED LAST YEAR IN EUGENE, WHERE MICHIGAN STATE LED 24-18 AT THE HALF ONLY TO HIT A SECOND-HALF WALL. AFTER AN MSU FIELD GOAL EXTENDED THE LEAD TO 27-18 IN THE THIRD QUARTER, OREGON SCORED 28 UNANSWERED POINTS TO WIN 46-27. THIS YEAR, THE GAME IS IN EAST LANSING AND MICHIGAN STATE LOOKS TO BE THE BETTER, MORE EXPERIENCED TEAM BEHIND QUARTERBACK CONNOR COOK. OR IS OREGON'S SPEED JUST TOO MUCH FOR EVERY BIG TEN TEAM BUT OHIO STATE? SEPT. 19: GEORGIA TECH AT NOTRE DAME (3:30 P.M., NBC) - GEORGIA TECH CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE NATION'S MORE UNDERRATED TEAMS. THE YELLOWJACKETS HAVE BEEN TO TWO OF THE LAST THREE ACC TITLE GAMES. PAUL JOHNSON KNOWS HOW TO COACH. TECH'S OPTION OFFENSE REQUIRES EXTRA PREPARATION AND THE TEAM FROM ATLANTA WILL BE JACKED UP TO PLAY IN SOUTH BEND. MEANWHILE, IF NOTRE DAME HAS COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF ASPIRATIONS, THE IRISH MUST WIN THIS GAME. SEPT. 26: UCLA AT ARIZONA (TBA) - RICH RODRIGUEZ HAS REVITALIZED THE ARIZONA PROGRAM. JIM MORA JR. HAS REVITALIZED THE UCLA PROGRAM. WITH OREGON LOSING QUARTERBACK MARCUS MARIOTA, THE DOOR MAY BE OPEN TO A DIFFERENT PAC-12 CHAMPION. IF SO, THIS GAME IN TUCSON COULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARD IDENTIFYING THE NEW TEAM TO BEAT. OCT. 3: ALABAMA AT GEORGIA (TBA) - ALABAMA DOESN'T COME TO ATHENS ALL THAT OFTEN, BUT, AS USUAL, BOTH PROGRAMS HAVE BOTH CONFERENCE AND NATIONAL TITLE ASPIRATIONS. GEORGIA'S NICK CHUBB MAY BE THE BEST RUNNING BACK IN THE COUNTRY BUT ALABAMA'S DERRICK HENRY ISN'T BAD EITHER. AND BY THIS TIME, SURELY, ALABAMA'S NICK SABAN AND GEORGIA'S MARK RICHT WILL HAVE DECIDED ON A QUARTERBACK. SURELY. OCT. 10: GEORGIA AT TENNESSEE (TBA) - YES, WE'RE GOING WITH BACK-TO-BACK GEORGIA GAMES BECAUSE GEORGIA HAS BACK-TO-BACK BIG GAMES. TENNESSEE BELIEVES IT IS BACK, BABY, AND THIS GAME COULD PROVE IT. BUTCH JONES' CLUB GOT TO SEVEN WINS LAST SEASON AND IS AIMING HIGHER IN 2015. A WIN OVER THE BULLDOGS MIGHT EVEN PUT THE VOLS' IN THE SEC EAST DRIVER'S SEAT. OCT. 17: USC AT NOTRE DAME (7:30 P.M., NBC) - THE LUSTER MIGHT BE RETURNING TO THIS AGE-OLD RIVALRY. USC HAS WHAT NOTRE DAME HOPES TO DEVELOP - A TOP-SHELF QUARTERBACK. CODY KESSLER SET A USC RECORD BY COMPLETING 69.7 PERCENT OF HIS PASSES LAST YEAR. NOTRE DAME'S DEFENSE WILL PRESENT A CHALLENGE. IT USUALLY DOES. OCT. 24: AUBURN AT ARKANSAS (TBA) - THIRD-YEAR COACH BRET BIELEMA HAS GIVEN ARKANSAS FOOTBALL BACK ITS EDGE, THIS TIME IN THE FORM OF A POWER RUNNING GAME. THE RAZORBACKS LOST RUNNING BACK JONATHAN WILLIAMS TO A FOOT INJURY, BUT FELLOW THOUSAND-YARD RUSHER ALEX COLLINS SHOULD BE A HANDFUL FOR AUBURN'S NEW DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WILL MUSCHAMP. TO WIN THE SEC WEST, AUBURN NEEDS TO WIN THIS ONE. OCT. 29: OREGON AT ARIZONA STATE (10:30 P.M., ESPN) - TODD GRANTHAM TOOK SOME HEAT WHEN HE EXITED PITTSBURGH AFTER JUST ONE YEAR TO TAKE RESIDENCE IN TEMPE. GRANTHAM CAN COACH, HOWEVER. THE SUN DEVILS ARE COMING OFF BACK-TO-BACK 10-WIN SEASONS AND A WIN OVER OREGON IN YEAR THREE OF THE GRANTHAM ERA WOULD SEND A NATIONAL SIGNAL. NOV. 7: FLORIDA STATE AT CLEMSON (TBA) - QUARTERBACK JAMEIS WINSTON IS GONE. BUT SEMINOLES HEAD COACH JIMBO FISHER STILL HAS PLENTY OF NFL-READY TALENT BUT THE VISITORS WILL HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL TRYING TO CONTAIN CLEMSON QUARTERBACK DESHAUN WATSON. THIS GAME COULD DETERMINE WHICH TEAM IS IN THE ACC TITLE GAME. NOV. 14: OKLAHOMA AT BAYLOR (TBA) - BOB STOOPS IS IN NEED OF A BOUNCE-BACK YEAR AFTER THE SOONERS' 2014 SLIDE TO 8-5. ONE WAY TO GET THE TRAIN BACK ON THE TRACK IS TO BEAT BAYLOR IN WACO. THAT WON'T BE EASY. ART BRILES' OFFENSIVE JUGGERNAUT SURVIVED THE LOSS OF HEISMAN QUARTERBACK ROBERT GRIFFIN III, SO THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THE BEARS WON'T SURVIVE THE LOSS OF GRIFFIN'S STELLAR SUCCESSOR, BRYCE PETTY. NOV. 21: MICHIGAN STATE AT OHIO STATE (TBA) - NEVER MIND THE BIG TEN CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, THIS IS THE ONE THAT WILL DECIDE THE CONFERENCE CHAMPION. MICHIGAN STATE WON THE LEAGUE IN 2013. OHIO STATE WON IT LAST YEAR. THE BUCKEYES WILL HAVE THE HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE, BUT DON'T COUNT OUT THE SPARTANS. NOV. 27: BAYLOR AT TCU (7:30 P.M., ESPN) - THIS WILL BE A REAL DAY-AFTER-THANKSGIVING TREAT IN WACO. BAYLOR OFFICIALS INSIST IT WAS A FLUKE THAT PLAYERS WEARING THE NUMBERS 61 AND 58 WERE SIDE-BY-SIDE IN THE BEARS' 2015 TEAM PICTURE. THAT JUST HAPPENED TO BE THE FINAL SCORE OF BAYLOR'S WIN OVER TCU LAST YEAR. IT WAS THE ONLY LOSS OF THE YEAR FOR THE HORNED FROGS. DO YOU THINK TCU HAS FORGOTTEN? NOV. 28: OHIO STATE AT MICHIGAN (TBA) - TRUE, UCLA AT USC AND ALABAMA AT AUBURN ARE ON THE SAME DAY, BUT YOU NEVER GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME A JIM HARBAUGH-COACHED MICHIGAN TEAM WILL GO UP AGAINST AN URBAN MEYER-COACHED OHIO STATE TEAM. THE HOME FIELD IS PROBABLY MICHIGAN'S ONE AND ONLY ADVANTAGE. STILL, IT WILL BE FUN TO WATCH.
187	A RECENT CLAIM FROM A STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT ALPHA TESTER HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE GAME IS BROKEN AND THAT IT IS RUSHED BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF THE MOVIE, EPISODE 7: THE FORCE AWAKENS THIS DECEMBER. DO PLAYERS HAVE TO START WORRYING ABOUT THE QUALITY OF STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WHEN IT RELEASES THIS NOVEMBER AND DO THE CLAIMS HOLD ANY MERIT, OR IS IT THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE AT WORK? HERE IS WHY RECENT CLAIMS BY A SUPPOSED ALPHA TESTER SHOULDNT GET YOU TOO WORRIED. THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT FIRST AND FOREMOST, THERE WILL BE AN OPEN BETA COMING IN EARLY OCTOBER. I RECENTLY REPORTED ON THE OPEN BETA AND ASKED IF A BETA OPEN TO EVERYONE COULD BE A SIGN OF OVERCONFIDENCE ON EAS PART. IF YOUVE BEEN ON THE FENCE ABOUT BUYING THE GAME, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF WITHOUT ANY KIND OF MONETARY INVESTMENT (EXCEPT FOR DOWNLOADING THE BETA, THE SIZE OF WHICH IS NOT CONFIRMED. IF STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WAS REALLY A BUG FILLED MESS, THEN AN OPEN BETA WOULD BE THE WORST POSSIBLE DECISION FROM EA AND DICE. IM NOT SAYING THE BETA WILL BE PERFECT, BUT TO THINK THAT THE DEVELOPER AND PUBLISHER WILL HOST AN OPEN BETA FOR A BROKEN GAME IS PREPOSTEROUS. THE SECOND IMPORTANT ASPECT TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE CLAIMS COME FROM AN ALPHA TEST, NOT BETA. ALPHA TEST VERSIONS ARE GENERALLY BUG FILLED MESSES, AS IT IS A VERY EARLY BUILD OF THE GAME TO TEST FUNCTIONALITY. IF THE QUALITY OF A RELEASE VERSION OF ANY GAME WAS DETERMINED BY AN ALPHA TEST VERSION, EVERY GAME RELEASE WOULD BE A BROKEN MESS. FURTHERMORE, EA IS SEEMINGLY DOING A GOOD JOB WITH THE MULTIPLAYER, AS GARETH WOODS TRIED THE SQUADRON FIGHTER MODE LAST MONTH AND PRAISED THE GAME MODE FOR ITS AUTHENTIC FEELING AND FAST PACED ACTION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MR. WOODS DID NOT MENTION ANY BUGS OR ANYTHING GAME-BREAKING. NEOGAF USER ILLUCIO CLAIMS: I'VE BEEN ALPHA TESTING A FEW GAMES AND I CAN SAY BATTLEFRONT IS A COMPLETE MESS AND IS BROKEN. CONSIDERING THAT THEIR DEADLINE FOR THE GAME IS IN A FEW WEEKS AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T FIXED THE MAJORITY OF THE IN GAME PROBLEMS LET ALONE THE CONNECTION PROBLEM ME AND OTHER TESTERS WERE HAVING, YES IT'S GOING TO BE A MESS. AND EVEN A DAY 1 PATCH WON'T FIX ALL OF THEM, I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH OUTSIDE WHAT I PLAYED, BUT THE GAME IS INDEED RUSHED AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF EPISODE 7 RELEASING THIS DECEMBER. AND IN RETROSPECT I ALSO TESTED BLACK OPS 3 WHICH EVEN THOUGH IT HAD MANY PROBLEMS, IT WAS NO WHERE AS BAD AS BATTLEFRONT. SOURCE DO PLAYERS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED? IF YOU TAKE A LOOK BACK AT BATTLEFIELD 4'S LAUNCH, THEY DO HAVE A REASON NOT TO TRUST EA. MY NICHOLAS HOLDEN COLLEAGUE REPORTED MULTIPLE BATTLEFIELD 4 ISSUES, PC VERSION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY. HOWEVER, THE LATEST ENTRY IN THE BATTLEFIELD FRANCHISE, BATTLEFIELD: HARDLINE HAD AN EXCELLENT LAUNCH, AS I NOTED IN MY REVIEW THAT THE GAME WAS BASICALLY BUG FREE. IS THE BUG FREE STATE OF HARDLINE AT LAUNCH THE START OF A QUALITY LAUNCH TREND BY EA? HOPEFULLY. THE NEOGAF THREAD IN QUESTION IS ENTITLED QA TESTERS WARN: BROKEN GAMES FIASCO OF LAST YEAR MAY REPEAT THIS CHRISTMAS . ATTACHED IS A POLL ON WHICH AAA GAME, COMING THIS HOLIDAY, THE COMMUNITY THINKS WILL HAVE THE MOST BUGS. AT THE TIME OF WRITING, FALLOUT 4 IS ON TOP OF THE POLL, WITH ASSASSINS CREED: SYNDICATE IN SECOND PLACE AND STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT IN THIRD. HAVE PLAYERS LOST THEIR FAITH IN AAA GAME DEVELOPERS TO DELIVER A QUALITY, BUG FREE TITLE? IT SURE LOOKS THAT WAY. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING SCEPTICAL ABOUT A PRODUCT WHEN PREVIOUS TITLES BY A COMPANY HAVE HAD LESS THAN IDEAL LAUNCHES. HOWEVER, ITS ALSO NOT GOOD TO ALWAYS HAVE A GLASS HALF EMPTY OUTLOOK. I FOR ONE AM GIVING STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND WILL JUDGE THE GAME DURING THE OPEN BETA AND SUBSEQUENT FULL RELEASE. [EMBEDDED CONTENT] IN THE VIDEO ABOVE, YOU CAN SEE SOME ALPHA FOOTAGE IN ACTION, WHICH DOESNT LOOK BUGGY AT ALL. IF THERE IS ANY MERIT TO THE CLAIMS BY NEOGAF USER ILLUCIO, HOPEFULLY EA AND DICE WILL HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO FIX THE GAME BEFORE IT IS RELEASE. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT AN ALPHA VERSION OF THE GAME IS A LONG WAY OFF FULL RELEASE. STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WILL RELEASE ON PC, PLAYSTATION 4 AND XBOX ONE: NORTH AMERICA - NOVEMBER 17 EUROPE - NOVEMBER 19 (USUALLY SA RELEASE DATE AS WELL) UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 20 DO YOU THINK STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WILL BE BROKEN ON RELEASE OR WILL THE GAME HAVE LITTLE TO NO BUGS AT LAUNCH? LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK IN THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW. SOURCE: NEOGAF READ MORE ABOUT STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT: SILLICUR TWITTER /
188	BIG BLUE IS THE LATEST COMPANY TO BET ON AN ENTERPRISE FUTURE ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN THE LATEST SIGN THAT THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND BITCOIN IS BEING EMBRACED BY THE CORPORATE WORLD, IBM SAYS ITS EXPLORING HOW THE CRYPTOCURRENCYS SHARED LEDGER SYSTEM CAN BE USED IN FIELDS FROM BANKING TO THE INTERNET OF THINGS. "ITS A COMPLETELY NOVEL ARCHITECTURE FOR BUSINESSA FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING A NEW GENERATION OF TRANSACTIONAL APPLICATIONS THAT ESTABLISH TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY WHILE STREAMLINING BUSINESS PROCESSES," WROTE ARVIND KRISHNA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR OF IBM RESEARCH, IN A BLOG POST WEDNESDAY. "IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO VASTLY REDUCE THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF GETTING THINGS DONE." THE NOTION OF A BLOCKCHAIN WAS FIRST DEVELOPED BY BITCOINS PSEUDONYMOUS INVENTOR SATOSHI NAKAMOTO TO RECORD TRANSACTIONS IN THE CURRENCY WITHOUT THE NEED FOR BANKS OR ANY CENTRAL AUTHORITY. ALL TRANSFERS OF BITCOIN ARE ANNOUNCED TO THE CURRENCYS NETWORK OF USERS, AND BITCOIN MINERS ARE REWARDED WITH NEWLY GENERATED COINS FOR BUNDLING THOSE TRANSACTIONS INTO SPECIALLY FORMATTED RECORDS CALLED BLOCKS. NEW BLOCKS NEED TO SATISFY CERTAIN MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES WHEN TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THOSE ALREADY GENERATED, AND THE COMPLETE HISTORIC TRANSACTION RECORD IS KNOWN AS THE BLOCKCHAIN. THE BLOCKCHAIN, AND SELF-UPDATING APPLIANCES RIVAL CRYPTOCURRENCIES LIKE LITECOIN AND DOGECOIN EACH HAVE THEIR OWN BLOCKCHAINS, AND VARIOUS PROJECTS HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH USING BLOCKCHAINS TO STORE DATA BESIDES FINANCIAL TRANSFER RECORDS. A PROJECT CALLED NAMECOIN USES ITS BLOCKCHAIN TO RECORD INTERNET DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATIONS, AND THE ETHEREUM PROJECT ALLOWS ITS BLOCKCHAIN TO STORE SIMPLE PROGRAMS CALLED "SMART CONTRACTS" THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. TO IBM, WHICH HAS SEEN DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS EVOLVE FROM THE MAINFRAME-BASED SYSTEMS OF THE 1960S AND 70S TO TODAYS DISTRIBUTED SQL DATABASES, THE BLOCKCHAIN CONCEPT MIGHT JUST BE THE NEXT BIG THING IN SHARING DATA. THE COMPANY SAYS BLOCKCHAINS FUTURE BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SYSTEMS COULD MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER TO SHARE RECORDS AND EXECUTE ALL KINDS OF TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE BASED ON MORE TRADITIONAL CURRENCY. "WE ALWAYS HAVE OUR EYE OUT FOR THE NEXT INNOVATION AROUND THESE THINGS," SAYS IBM MIDDLEWARE CTO JERRY CUOMO. "WHEN YOU LOOK AT BLOCKCHAINTHAT NOTION OF A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT IS PEER-TO-PEER AND BASED ON SHARED LEDGER AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY WITH SMART CONTRACTSIT KIND OF TURNS THE MODEL ON ITS SIDE A BIT." CUOMO SAYS IBMS WORKING ON PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROJECTS WITH CLIENTS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES TO EXPLORE HOW BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY CAN MAKE THEIR BUSINESSES MORE EFFICIENT. COMPANIES COULD STORE TRANSACTIONS WITH SUPPLIERS AROUND THE GLOBE IN A SHARED BLOCKCHAIN, RATHER THAN MANUALLY EXCHANGING DATA FROM SEPARATE DATABASES, FOR EXAMPLE. CAR RENTAL AGENCIES COULD USE SMART CONTRACTS THAT AUTOMATICALLY ALLOW RENTALS WHEN PAYMENTS RECEIVED AND INSURANCE INFORMATION IS CONFIRMED THROUGH A BLOCKCHAIN RECORD, HE SAYS. "WHEN ALL OF THESE THREE AGREEMENTS ARE OUT THERE ON THE CHAIN, WE KIND OF FORM THE FINAL AGREEMENT, WHICH IS, ITS YOURS," HE SAYS. "YOU OWN THIS THING FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME, OR WHATEVER THE CONTRACT SAYS." AND SMART APPLIANCES MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO USE A BLOCKCHAIN INSTEAD OF A CONNECTION TO A TRADITIONAL CLOUD SERVER TO INTERACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD. "FOR INSTANCE, A REFRIGERATOR EQUIPPED WITH SENSORS AND CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET COULD USE BLOCKCHAIN TO MANAGE AUTOMATED INTERACTIONS WITH THE EXTERNAL WORLDANYTHING FROM ORDERING AND PAYING FOR FOOD TO ARRANGING FOR ITS OWN SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND TRACKING ITS WARRANTY," KRISHNA WROTE IN THE BLOG POST. BEFORE THE SYSTEMS CAN BE USED FOR POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE TRANSACTIONS, ITLL BE IMPORTANT TO GET PRIVACY AND SECURITY SETTINGS RIGHT, CUOMO SAYS, JUST AS CLOUD COMPUTING PROVIDERS HAVE ADAPTED TO STORING PROTECTED INFORMATION LIKE HEALTH RECORDS. A LOT OF THAT WILL COME DOWN TO BASIC ENCRYPTION OF THE DATA STORED ON THE CHAIN, ALONG WITH SOME TWEAKS TO EXISTING PROTOCOLS TO MAKE IT HARDER TO TRACK WHOS DOING BUSINESS WITH WHOM BASED ON THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS THAT ARE USED AS IDENTIFIERS. "YOU CAN LOOK OVER TIME AND SAY, HEY, EVERY MONDAY MORNING, PUBLIC KEY A IS DOING SOMETHING WITH PUBLIC KEY B,' AND, 'HEY, I DO SOMETHING WITH PUBLIC KEY B EVERY TUESDAY, AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DEDUCE SOMETHING FROM THAT, WHICH IN SOME CASES JUST WOULDN'T NOT BE ALLOWED," CUOMO SAYS. MEMBERS ONLY AND WHILE CURRENT PROJECTS LIKE BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM HAVE RELIED ON PUBLIC BLOCKCHAINS WHERE ALL USERS ARE ESSENTIALLY EQUAL, ENTERPRISE BLOCKCHAIN PROJECTS COULD USE INVITE-ONLY CHAINS WHERE DIFFERENT USERS HAVE DIFFERENT PRIVILEGES TO INITIATE AND VALIDATE DIFFERENT TRANSACTIONS, HE SAYS. IBMS ANNOUNCEMENT OF ITS PUSH INTO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGYWHICH CUOMO SAYS HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF RESEARCH WITHIN THE FIRM FOR AT LEAST THE PAST YEARFOLLOWS TUESDAYS NEWS THAT NINE MAJOR BANKS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS, JP MORGAN, CREDIT SUISSE, AND BARCLAYS, ARE WORKING WITH TECH FIRM R3 TO TEST AND STANDARDIZE BLOCKCHAIN TOOLS FOR THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY. OVERSTOCK.COM, THE ONLINE RETAILER THAT BEGAN ACCEPTING BITCOIN LAST YEAR, IS ALSO DEVELOPING ITS OWN BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SECURITIES TRADING PLATFORM CALLED T0. THE COMPANY MADE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SALES OF SO-CALLED CRYPTOBONDS THROUGH THE PLATFORM EARLIER THIS YEAR TO OVERSTOCK CEO PATRICK BYRNE AND TO FINANCIAL FIRM FIRST NEW YORK, AND SAYS T0 WILL SETTLE TRANSACTIONS SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN TRADITIONAL EXCHANGES. CUOMO SAYS IBM PLANS TO RELEASE SOURCE CODE AND OTHER DATA FROM ITS BLOCKCHAIN RESEARCH WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHSPOSSIBLY INCLUDING AN INTERNAL FLOWCHART HE SAYS THE COMPANY USES TO ILLUSTRATE WHEN USING A BLOCKCHAIN MAKES SENSE AND WHEN IT DOESN'T. "A BLOCKCHAIN IS THE NEW SHINY OBJECT, BUT IN SOME CASES, IF ITS USED FOR THE WRONG THING, IT MIGHT BE TWICE AS SLOW AND TWICE AS EXPENSIVE AS USING A TRADITIONAL DATABASE," HE SAYS.

191	CATERHAM PHOTOGRAPHER 'CHASING THE PERFECT PICTURE' TALKS ABOUT HER CAREER CAPTURING ARTISTS ON TOUR 16:48, 22 SEP 2015 UPDATED 16:49, 22 SEP 2015 BY AMANIHUGHES, CHRISTIE GOODWIN HAS BEEN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS SINCE THE AGE OF 12 AND HAS BUILT UP AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY CAPTURING TOP RECORDING ARTISTS ON TOUR VIEW GALLERY FROM THE LIKES OF KATY PERRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND ONE DIRECTION, THIS PHOTOGRAPHER FROM CATERHAM HAS CAPTURED A HEAP OF FAMOUS NAMES AND IS CONTINUING HER SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT PICTURE. CHRISTIE GOODWIN, A BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHER, WHOSE CAREER SPANS MORE THAN 35 YEARS, STARTED TAKING PICTURES AT THE AGE OF 12 AND WAS BOUGHT HER FIRST CAMERA AT 13. SHE GRADUATED FROM THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS IN ANTWERP AND GOT HER FIRST JOB IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY, EVOLVING TOWARDS EDITORIAL AND WORKING FOR NEWS AGENCIES BEFORE ENDING UP IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND TAKING PICTURES OF ARTISTS ON TOUR. CHRISTIE'S PORTFOLIO IS A WHO'S WHO OF TOP NAMES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, INCLUDING KATY PERRY, ED SHEERAN, USHER, TAYLOR SWIFT, ONE DIRECTION, SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY AND KYLIE MINOGUE, AMONG MANY OTHERS. SHE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME ON TOUR CAPTURING IMAGES OF ARTISTS WHICH APPEAR ON CDS, DVDS, TOUR MERCHANDISE, POSTERS, INTERNATIONAL PUBLICATIONS, BOOKS AND EXHIBITIONS. EVEN THOUGH CHRISTIE HAS BEEN ON TOUR WITH MANY ARTISTS SHE ADMITTED SHE IS STILL ON THE HUNT FOR THE ELUSIVE PERFECT PICTURE. THE THING I HAVE BEEN CHASING IS THE PERFECT PICTURE, IT KEEPS ME GOING, TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT, CHRISTIE SAID. PHOTOGRAPHY IS BASICALLY ONE MOMENT IN TIME AND YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL TO OTHERS, THAT'S WHY YOU CAPTURE IT, TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE WHAT YOU FELT AND WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED. I WANT TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT IN TIME, IF I SHOOT A SHOW I WANT THE VIEWER TO FEEL LIKE THEY WERE THERE, THAT WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT A PICTURE THEY FEEL THE MUSIC AND FEEL THE CROWD. THAT'S WHAT I AIM FOR IN MY PHOTOGRAPHY. @CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE EXPLAINED OUT OF ALL THE TOURS SHE HAS CAPTURED, KATY PERRY'S PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR WAS THE MOST EXCITING. I STARTED DOING THE REHEARSALS SO I ACTUALLY SAW THE SHOW BUILD UP TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE END, I SPEND TWO TO THREE WEEKS ON THE SHOW. IT WAS REALLY EXCITING TO SEE HOW SOMETHING COMES TO LIFE. THROUGHOUT HER ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER CHRISTIE HAS CAPTURED SOME POWERFUL IMAGES, FROM BB KING AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL TO SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY STRUMMING A GUITAR. HOWEVER SHE EXPLAINED HER FAVOURITE MOMENT TAKEN SO FAR WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF KATY PERRY DURING HER PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR. AN IMAGE WHICH IS NOW ICONIC AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD TO PUBLICISE THE TOUR. IN THE SHOW IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE FIREWORKS WERE BEHIND HER, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN, CHRISTIE SAID. THE MOMENT THE FIREWORKS GO, YOU GET TO SHOOT THREE FRAMES, SHE DIDN'T HAVE HER HEAD AROUND, THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE FIREWORKS. THAT FRAME HAS MADE HISTORY AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD, IT WAS A LUCKY SHOT AND I WAS HAPPY THAT WE GOT IT. ALWAYS ON THE MOVE EVEN THOUGH PHOTOGRAPHING FAMOUS ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS SOUNDS EXCITING AND CONSTANTLY DIFFERENT, CHRISTIE ASSURED IT WAS NOT ALWAYS GLAMOROUS, AS YOU ARE ALWAYS ON THE MOVE AND NEVER IN ONE PLACE FOR VERY LONG. WHEN YOU DO NOT TRAVEL, IT'S VERY EXCITING BUT WHEN YOU TRAVEL ALL THE TIME, LITTLE THINGS START TO BOTHER YOU, YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR LAUNDRY AND YOU ARE NOT IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG TIME, IT'S A DRAG. HOWEVER IN CONTRAST TO THIS CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE EASILY GETS BORED AND ITCHY FEET WHEN SHE COMES HOME TO CATERHAM AND IS EAGER TO GET OFF TO HER NEXT DESTINATION AND NEXT TOUR. THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS I DO ENJOY, YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES, SLEEP IN YOUR OWN BED, BUT AFTER THREE DAYS I WANT TO GO AGAIN, I GET BORED. WHEN I AM ON THE ROAD, I WANT TO BE BACK AT HOME AND WHEN I'M HOME I WANT TO BE ON THE ROAD. I CANNOT LIVE AT HOME, I WOULD GET BORED, BUT YOU ALSO CANNOT BE ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME, I NEED A COMBINATION OF THE TWO. WHEN ASKED IF SHE COULD IMAGINE HER LIFE TAKING A DIFFERENT PATH, CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED DOING ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN PHOTOGRAPHY. I COULD NOT BE ANYTHING ELSE, WHEN I PICK UP A CAMERA, IT'S JUST ME AND THE CAMERA, IT'S PART OF ME, IT'S WHO I AM, I CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT THE CAMERA. TAKE PHOTOS LIKE A PRO CHRISTIE HAS TEAMED UP WITH CURRYS PC WORLD TO HELP MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR CAMERA EQUIPMENT AND PROVIDES HER TOP TIPS ON HOW TO CAPTURE PHOTOGRAPHS AT FESTIVALS, FROM TAKING THE PERFECT FESTIVAL SELFIE, LOOKING TO NAVIGATE OBSTRUCTIVE CROWDS OR CAPTURING FAST-MOVING STAGE ACTION. PLAN AHEAD: LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE, KNOW WHICH ARTISTS YOU WANT TO SHOOT, AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT IF YOU WISH TO PHOTOGRAPH BANDS ON DIFFERENT STAGES, YOU NEED TO GET THERE IN TIME. ALSO PREPARE FOR THE FACT THAT THEY MIGHT NOT START EXACTLY WHEN THEYRE SUPPOSED TO. I ALWAYS CARRY MY OWN FESTIVAL SCHEDULE ON MY PHONE. SHOOTING MY FIRST BIG FESTIVAL EARLY ON IN MY CAREER, I NEARLY MISSED AC/DC, BECAUSE I WASNT PREPARED! BE PREPARED: MAKE SURE YOU BRING ENOUGH MEMORY CARDS AND BATTERY POWER TO LAST ALL THE WAY. CHANCES ARE YOU WONT HAVE ANYWHERE TO CHARGE THEM FOR HOURS AND YOU DONT WANT TO RUN OUT JUST BEFORE YOUR FAVOURITE BAND IS ON. KEEP THEM IN A LITTLE POUCH WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES AND MAKE SURE ITS WATERPROOF, SO YOU DONT BECOME VICTIM TO FAILING CAMERA EQUIPMENT. COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS: FESTIVAL STAGES CAN BE QUITE MESSY AND CLUTTERY, SO TAKE THE TIME TO COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS. LOOK FOR ANGLES WHERE YOU CAN AVOID PEOPLE OR OBJECTS THAT WILL MAKE THE PHOTO LOOK A MESS. FESTIVAL STAGES CAN ALSO BE VERY HIGH, ESPECIALLY THE MAIN STAGE, SO IT CAN EVEN BE A CHALLENGE FOR US PROS IN THE PHOTO PIT IN FRONT OF THE STAGE. BUT MAKE SURE YOU WAIT FOR THOSE MOMENTS WHEN YOUR FAVOURITE SINGER IS RIGHT AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE THATS WHERE YOU GET YOUR BEST SHOTS. REMEMBER THE CROWD: SOME OF MY BEST SHOTS ARE NOT OF THE ARTISTS BUT OF PEOPLE IN THE CROWD. THE CROWD OFTEN MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE AND CAN BRING TO LIFE THAT FEELING YOU GET BEING AT A FESTIVAL. THE GO PRO HERO 4 OR EE 4GEE ACTION CAM ARE GREAT FOR THIS KIND OF SHOT DUE TO THEIR ULTRA-WIDE ANGLE LENSES FOR A UNIQUE CROWD VIEW. WHEN YOU DO THIS, TRY TO HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER OR EVEN LOWER, PLAY WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES. MAKE SURE TO ALSO TAKE AT LEAST ONE LONG WALK AROUND THE WHOLE FESTIVAL GROUND TO HELP YOU FIND THE PERFECT SUBJECTS. MIND THE RAIN: FESTIVALS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR EVER-CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS. PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEOPLE IN THE MUD ARE TOKEN FESTIVAL SHOTS. HAVING RAIN VISIBLE IN THE SHOT CAN ADD SOMETHING INTERESTING, SO DONT TAKE IT AS A BAD THING. I NEVER GO TO A FESTIVAL WITHOUT A PLASTIC BAG TO PROTECT MY GEAR, AND HAVING A WATERPROOF CASE OR AN ACTUAL WATERPROOF CAMERA LIKE THE FUJIFILM XP80 CAN HELP TO CATER FOR ANY WEATHER CHANGE. CONSIDER YOUR LENSES: CHANGING LENSES IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD CAN BE A NIGHTMARE. DUST, MUD, THE BOOTS OF A CROWDSURFER AND AN AIRBOURNE CUP OF BEER HAVE A WAY OF FINDING YOU THE TIME YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LENS. PRACTICE CHANGING THE LENS UNDER A PLASTIC BAG OR UNDER YOUR JACKET. BECOME A FESTIVAL SELFIE KING OR QUEEN: IF YOURE GOING TO TAKE A SELFIE, MAKE SURE THE SELFIE TELLS A STORY. YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE OF YOURSELF, OR YOU CAN TAKE A FEW EXTRA SECONDS AND FRAME THAT SELFIE A LITTLE BETTER, GET SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THE SHOT, OR SOMETHING ANNOYING OUT OF IT. TAKE YOUR TIME, LOOK AROUND, AND MAYBE HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER SO THAT YOU HAVE THE WHOLE FESTIVAL IN THE BACKGROUND. IF YOU TAKE A LOT OF SELFIES, THE COMPACT PANASONIC TZ57 HAS A SELFIE SCREEN AND WI-FI SO YOU CAN POST IT ON THE WEB IMMEDIATELY. THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT: WHEN YOU TAKE PHOTOS OF YOUR FRIENDS, OR WHEN YOU TAKE SELFIES, TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT. IF THE SUN IS BEHIND THE PERSON IN THE PHOTO, THEIR FACE WILL BE DARKER. ITS NOT A BAD IDEA TO USE A FLASH IF YOURE SHOOTING AGAINST THE LIGHT, EVEN ON A SUNNY DAY. OR DO THE OPPOSITE, SHOOT AGAINST THE LIGHT AND PLAY WITH DARK SILHOUETTES. YOU DONT NEED A PRO CAMERA TO GET AN AMAZING SHOT LIKE THAT. TAKE IN THE VIEW: IT CAN BE REALLY FUN TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT LENSES. A FISH-EYE OR WIDE-ANGLE LENS CAN REALLY HELP CAPTURE THE SCALE OF THE FESTIVAL. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE FUN. A FISH-EYE IS A PRIME LENS, MEANING THAT YOU CANT ZOOM IN OR OUT WITH IT. THEREFORE, ITS UP TO YOU TO ACT AS THE ZOOM FOR THE LENS. BE SURE TO CHANGE PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES AND LINES. GET DOWN LOW TO THE GROUND, EVEN IF IT MEANS LAYING ON YOUR STOMACH IN WHATS LEFT OF THE FESTIVAL GRASS. LEAN UP AGAINST A WALL AND USE THE DISTORTION OF THE LENS TO WRAP THE WALL AROUND THE FRAME. JUST HAVE FUN! BE AWARE THAT IF YOU FRAME A CLOSE UP OF A PERSON NEAR THE OUTER EDGES OF A WIDE ANGLE OR FISH-EYE SHOT, THEIR FACE CAN BE STRETCHED OUT. KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT: THIS ONE IS CRUCIAL. GETTING A NEW CAMERA WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT FEATURES IS TEMPTING, BUT MAKE SURE YOU LEARN HOW TO USE THEM. WALK THROUGH THE MANUAL GUIDE AND TEST IT ALL OUT. IT MIGHT SEEM A BIT TEDIOUS TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE STEPS BUT EVEN THE PRO PHOTOGRAPHER TAKES HIS TIME TO LEARN TO KNOW THEIR CAMERA. ONCE YOU KNOW ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF YOUR CAMERA AND HOW TO USE THEM THEN THERE IS NOTHING STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND THAT PERFECT SHOT. CHRISTIE ADDED TO TAKE MANY PHOTOS, AS IT IS THE VOLUME THAT MATTERS AND GET TO KNOW YOUR CAMERA. DO NOT SHOOT ON THE AUTOMATIC, PUT YOUR CAMERA ON MANUAL AND TEST IT OUT, YOU CANNOT LET THE CAMERA THINK FOR YOU, YOU HAVE TO THINK FOR THE CAMERA AND SHOOT WHAT YOU WANT.

192	EACH DAY WE SEE THE EFFORT OF UNIONS TO FORCE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY FARM WORKERS TO PAY BRIBES TO WORK. THEN YOU HAVE THE EFFORT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES ARE FORCING WORKERS TO SPEND MORE ON WORKING CONDITIONS. THEN YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR FARMS, ESPECIALLY IF A NEW PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. THE SOLUTION IS ROBOTS AND MACHINES TO DO THE PICKING AND HARVESTING OF CROPS. WHILE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE NEW MACHINES, THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SO. YEARS AGO UC DAVIS DEVELOPED A TOMATO PICKING MACHINEBUT THE UNIONS STOPPED ITS DEVELOPMENT. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. AGAIN, AMERICA CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN AGRICULTURE INTERNATIONALLY. WE CAN INNOVATE AND FEED THE HUNGRY MASSES BY MAKING FOOD AVAILABILITY MORE RELIABLE AND LOW COST. 4 LABOR-INTENSIVE CROPS FARMERS WISH THEY HAD ROBOTS TO HARVEST ELIZA BARCLAY, KPBS, THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION SAYS MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO PICK HOT AND BELL PEPPERS COULD HELP SOLVE LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEMS. IF YOURE ENJOYING A LATE-SUMMER FRUIT PIE THIS LABOR DAY, CONSIDER WHAT WENT INTO GROWING AND HARVESTING THAT FRUIT. CHANCES ARE, IT TOOK A LOT OF HUMAN HANDS TO ENSURE ITS SKIN WOULD BE PERFECT AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. WHILE MACHINES HAVE REPLACED HUMAN HANDS FOR A LOT OF FARM JOBS THE HARVESTING OF TOMATOES FOR PROCESSING, THE CUTTING OF LETTUCE AND SPINACH, THE SHAKING OF ALMOND TREES TO MAKE THE NUTS FALL TO THE GROUND MANY FRUIT, VEGETABLE AND NUT FARMERS STILL RELY HEAVILY ON PEOPLE TO PLANT, MAINTAIN AND HARVEST THEIR CROPS. MACHINES DONT YET EXIST FOR THESE CROPS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN AMPLE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK, AND BECAUSE ITS HARD TO DESIGN MACHINES THAT CAN CUT OR PICK THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLES WITHOUT SQUISHING OR DAMAGING THEM TOO MUCH. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. ALL THATS CREATED A NEW PUSH FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO MECHANIZATION TO REPLACE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME FILLING. THERES AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF FRESH-MARKET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS, MATTHEW WHITING , AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND EXTENSION SPECIALIST AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEET CHERRY INDUSTRY, TELLS SALT. THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED HARVEST LABOR IS ON EVERY GROWERS MIND. FOR LABOR DAY, WE THOUGHT WED ROUND UP SOME OF THE CROPS THAT CANT YET BE HARVESTED BY A MACHINE, BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE FUTURE. TO BE CLEAR, THE ISSUE OF LABOR IS COMPLICATED. AND MACHINES THAT COULD HARVEST THESE CROPS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE. SWEET CHERRIES THESE ARE THE SOFT, SWEET CHERRIES WE GET IN BAGS WITH THE STEM ATTACHED. AND WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND PLUMP? BECAUSE A HUMAN HAND CAREFULLY PICKED THEM.  ELLISON RECEIVED 3 MILLION OPTIONS TO PURCHASE ORACLE SHARES, ANDHURD AND CATZ WERE EACH GIVEN 2.75 MILLION, GRANTED WITH STRIKE PRICES BETWEEN $38.89 AND $40.47, ACCORDING TO THE FILING. BUT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER WILLING HANDS TO DO THAT WORK. AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTICED. OF ALL THE PRODUCERS THAT DREAM MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO EASE THEIR LABOR WOES, THE SWEET CHERRY GROWERS MIGHT BE THE CLOSEST TO GETTING ONE THANKS TO RESEARCH FUNDING. MATT WHITING SAYS HE AND OTHERS AT WSU ARE CLOSE TO FINDING A COMMERCIAL PARTNER FOR A PROTOTYPE HARVESTER THAT CAN PICK 50 TIMES AS MANY CHERRIES A HUMAN BEING WOULD IN THE SAME TIME. STILL, THERES ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS NEW MODEL IS VIABLE: NEW VARIETIES OF CHERRIES SUITED TO THE MECHANICAL HARVESTER WILL NEED TO BE BRED. WHITING SAYS RESEARCH IS HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT IN 10 TO 12 YEARS, SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER GROWERS A SUITE OF NEW VARIETIES. ASPARAGUS AS THE HUFFINGTON POST HAS REPORTED , ASPARAGUS IS UNIQUELY LABOR INTENSIVE BECAUSE THE QUICK-GROWING PLANT MUST BE HARVESTED EVERY DAY OF ITS THREE-MONTH GROWING SEASON. EACH PLANT SPROUTS MULTIPLE SPEARS (THE PART OF THE PLANT WE EAT) A DAY, WHICH HAVE TO BE HAND-CUT EVERY DAY. SO THAT MEANS WORKERS ARE CUTTING 14 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FROM ROUGHLY FEBRUARY TO MAY. BUT VARIOUS MECHANICAL ASPARAGUS HARVESTERS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING THEM. ACCORDING TO A 2009 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT , IF THE U.S.  INSTITUTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW. APPLES COMMERCIAL APPLE PICKING TODAY REQUIRES BRAWN WORKERS HAVE TO FILL BUCKETS ALL DAY LONG WITH HEAVY APPLES AND THEN DUMP THEM INTO BINS. AND ACCORDING A FRUIT INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION , THE ERA OF FULLY AUTOMATED ROBOTIC HARVESTERS NAVIGATING [APPLE] ORCHARD ROWS IS STILL YEARS AWAY. WHITING SAYS THATS BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS DEDICATED LITTLE FUNDING DEDICATED TO RESEARCH. THATS CHANGING, THOUGH. THE WASHINGTON STATE TREE FRUIT RESEARCH COMMISSION IS NOW PURSUING MORE RESEARCH ON MECHANICAL HARVESTING. AND THIS YEAR, SOME COMMERCIAL APPLE FARMERS MAY BE USING A VACUUM HARVESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME. ITS DESIGNERS SAY IT SAVES TIME, REDUCES PICKER FATIGUE AND BOOST THE HARVEST YIELD. PEPPERS CALIFORNIA GROWS ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE PEPPERS IN U.S., AND LATELY THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION HAS BEEN TALKING MORE DEVELOPING MECHANICAL HARVESTING AND VARIETIES BRED TO BE PICKED BY MACHINES. ACCORDING TO A 2015 REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION, WITH INCREASING COST AND DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF LABOR NEEDED TO PICK PEPPERS, INNOVATION [SIMILAR TO THE PROCESSED TOMATO INDUSTRY] COULD GIVE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. FARMERS SIGNIFICANT RETURNS AND POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PEPPER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA, THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO HAVE FRESH MARKET QUALITY AND MECHANICAL HARVESTING IN BOTH BLOCKY [BELL PEPPERS] AND HOT TYPES.

HAHA IF YOU ARE REALLY CONCERNED, AND THE COLD WEATHER IS COMING WITH INCREASED RISK OF COLIC FROM DEHYDRATION IN WINTER, YOU CAN PUT SOME APPLE JUICE/CIDER IN HER WATER TO SWEETEN IT SOME AND ENCOURAGE MORE DRINKING. YOU CAN ALSO MAKE HER BRAN MASH IN WINTER FOR SOME EXTRA MOISTURE AND AS A TREAT ON COLD NIGHTS. A BIT OF CARROT JUICE AND WATER IN A BUCKET IS GOOD TOO.

IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE FOR THE FINEST MEMOIRS/AUTOBIOGRAPHIES I'VE READ BY INDIANS-WHETHER KHUSHWANT SINGH'S TRUTH, LOVE & A LITTLE MALICE, VINOD MEHTA'S LUCKNOW BOY, AND SINCE WE'RE TALKING FILMS, NASEERUDDIN SHAH'S AND THEN ONE DAY. THE LATEST V. SHANTARAM BOOK IS OF COURSE NOT AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY. THIS IS HIS DAUGHTER MADHURA PANDIT JASRAJ'S ATTEMPT AT RE-ENCAPSULATING HER FATHER'S CAREER. MUCH BEFORE THE STAR SYSTEM IN INDIAN CINEMA, THERE USED TO BE THE STUDIO SYSTEM. THE UNPAID OFFICE INTERN (SUCH AS YOUNG S.R. VANKUDRE IN THE PIONEER BABURAO PAINTER'S MAHARASHTRA FILM COMPANY IN KOLHAPUR) COULD WELL BE THE LEAD ACTOR. WHICH IS HOW VANKUDRE (WHO LATER NAMED HIMSELF V. SHANTARAM) MADE HIS SCREEN DEBUT IN 1921, WITH THE SILENT MOVIE SUREKHA HARAN, A MYTHOLOGICAL FILM, OBVIOUSLY. THERE IS OF COURSE MUCH IN SHANTARAM'S EARLY LIFE AND CAREER TO MARVEL AT. HIS FIRST JOB WAS AS A MANUAL LABOURER IN THE RAILWAYS. HE WENT ON TO ACT/DIRECT/PRODUCE 81 FILMS, BESIDES FOUNDING TWO STUDIOS-PRABHAT AND RAJKAMAL. WE'RE LOOKING AT A BOY WHO JOINED THE MOVIE INDUSTRY IN 1920 AND REMAINED ASSOCIATED WITH IT UNTIL HE DIED IN 1990. THAT IS SEVEN YEARS SHORT OF THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF INDIAN CINEMA-FROM SILENT TO TALKIE TO COLOUR TO TV. YOU WISH TO GET A SENSE OF THE CHANGING WORLD AROUND SHANTARAM-FILMS INCLUDED. THERE IS LITTLE OF THAT IN THE BOOK. ON THE PERSONAL FRONT, THE PORTRAIT THAT EMERGES OF SHANTARAM IS OF A MAN OBSESSED WITH HIS WORK, YES; BUT OF AN ASEXUAL FILMMAKER REPEATEDLY SPURRING ADVANCES FROM HIS EVER-WILLING HEROINES. AS A STUDIO BOSS, HE SEEMS WHOLLY SELFLESS, DOING EVERYTHING TO KEEP THE FLOCK TOGETHER, WHILE HIS JEALOUS, CONNIVING PARTNERS GANG UP TO DISLODGE HIM FROM THE PUNE-BASED PRABHAT FILM COMPANY. MIHIR BOSE'S SEMINAL WORK BOLLYWOOD: A HISTORY CITES SHANTARAM'S SON KIRAN'S BIOGRAPHY TO SUGGEST THAT THE REASON HIS PARTNERS DESERTED HIM WAS BECAUSE SHANTARAM HAD BROKEN A CARDINAL RULE: FALLEN FOR AN EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY, A MUCH YOUNGER ACTOR JAYASHREE WHOM HE MARRIED LATER. MADHURA IS SHANTARAM'S DAUGHTER FROM HIS FIRST WIFE VIMAL. SHANTARAM BOUNCED BACK WITH A NEW STUDIO, RAJKAMAL, HAVING MOVED TO BOMBAY. BY THE TIME THE FIRST RAJKAMAL FILM WAS READY (IN THE LATTER HALF OF 1943), WE'RE TOLD, HE HAD BECOME FATHER OF TWO MORE CHILDREN-CHARUSHEELA (HIS DAUGHTER FROM VIMAL), AND KIRAN, THE BIOGRAPHER (HIS SON FROM JAYASHREE). POLYGAMY MAY HAVE BEEN CULTURALLY ACCEPTABLE THEN. INTRICACIES OF SUCH A RELATIONSHIP INSPIRE MUCH CURIOSITY NOW. MADHURA, THE INSIDER, DWELLS NO FURTHER ON THIS POLITICS, STICKING TO HER FATHER'S PROFESSIONAL CV. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE BOOK'S TITLE: THE MAN WHO CHANGED INDIAN CINEMA. WAS SHANTARAM THAT MAN? IN THE EARLY YEARS OF TALKIES, MOVIES MAINLY MEANT 'HISTORICALS'/'MYTHOLOGICALS' LADEN WITH SONGS. DUNIYA NA MANE (1937; A FILM ON CHILD MARRIAGE) ONWARDS, SHANTARAM DID PROVE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MAKE FILMS ON SENSITIVE, SENSIBLE, SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS SUBJECTS THAT WERE ALSO COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. SHANTARAM DISPLAYED STAGGERING RANGE-HIS DO ANKHEN BARAH HAATH (1957, ON PRISON REFORMS) PICKED UP BOTH THE GOLDEN BEAR AT BERLIN AND A GOLDEN GLOBE, AND REMAINS FRESH IN PUBLIC MEMORY STILL. BESIDES BEING A PROGRESSIVE FILMMAKER, SHANTARAM WAS AN INSTITUTION BUILDER, WHICH TRULY EXPLAINS THE SIZE OF HIS CONTRIBUTION. HE ALSO INTRODUCED A POSSE OF TALENTS OVER SIX DECADES. THE CURRENT GENERATION WILL STILL KNOW MUMTAZ AND JEETENDRA FROM THIS BOOK. AND YEAH, HE WAS A WONDERFUL FAMILY MAN. MADHURA'S WARM LOVE LETTER TO HER DECEASED FATHER IS TESTIMONY TO THAT, EVEN IF IT FEELS LIKE A SERIES OF WIKIPEDIA ENTRIES. TO USE THE MOST TERRIBLE FILM REVIEWING CLICH, SINCE THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT FILMS: IT'S REALLY LONG; BUT YOU MUST READ IT, IF YOU'RE A SHANTARAM FAN! WELL. MAYANK SHEKHAR IS A FILM CRITIC AND RUNS THEW14.COM
197	IT WAS ANNOUNCED DURING THE SUMMERSLAM PAY-PER-VIEW A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT BROCK LESNAR WILL BE COMPETING AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN ON OCTOBER 3RD AS PART OF A WWE NETWORK SPECIAL. EVER SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF SPECULATION AS TO WHO THE BEAST COULD BE FACING AS HE DESCENDS UPON ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ARENAS IN THE WORLD FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WRESTLEMANIA 20, BUT IT SEEMS THAT WWE HAVE FINALLY REVEALED A GIANT OPPONENT FOR HIM. RETIREMENT MATCH? THE BIG SHOW HAS BEEN UNVEILED AS THE MAN WHO WILL TAKE ON THE HUMAN SUPLEX MACHINE IN NEW YORK CITY NEXT MONTH. BUT THE REAL QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS WILL BE BIG SHOW'S LAST MATCH. SIGN UP NOW WANT TO BECOME A GMS WRITER? SIGN UP NOW AND SUBMIT A 250 WORD TEST ARTICLE: HTTP://GMS.TO/HAVEYOURSAY4 LATELY BIG SHOW HAS BEEN REACTING TO THE WWE UNIVERSE'S CHANTS OF "PLEASE RETIRE" BY TELLING THEM TO FIND SOMEONE WORTHY OF RETIRING HIM BECAUSE WWE HAS NO ONE DESERVING OF THAT ACCOLADE. WHO BETTER THAN BROCK LESNAR TO DO THE HONORS? BIG SHOW HASN'T DONE A LOT IN WWE AS OF LATE AND SINCE HE LEFT THE AUTHORITY HE HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH SURPLUS TO REQUIREMENTS ON THE MAIN ROSTER. HE WAS NEVER REALLY A CREDIBLE CHALLENGE TO RYBACK'S INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP REIGN SO IT IS STILL YET TO BE MADE APPARENT AS TO WHY THEY ARE STILL IN A RIVALRY. HE FACED "THE BIG GUY" AGAIN ON MONDAY NIGHT RAW AND ONCE AGAIN HE WAS DEFEATED IN A TITLE MATCH. IT'S SAD TO SEE HOW LOW BIG SHOW HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO FALL OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS BUT IT SEEMS THIS COULD BE A CREDIBLE WAY TO ALLOW "THE WORLD'S LARGEST ATHLETE" TO FINALLY BOW OUT. NETWORK SPECIAL ALLOWING BIG SHOW TO BOW OUT IN A NETWORK SPECIAL DOES SEEM HARSH, BUT GIVEN THE RIGHT PROMOTION AND BUILD UP AND WWE COULD NOT ONLY MAKE THIS A CELEBRATION OF BROCK LESNAR BUT THEY COULD ALSO MAKE IT A DECENT RETIREMENT PARTY FOR BIG SHOW. THE BEAST IN THE EAST WAS A NETWORK SPECIAL AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THE BETTER PAY-PER-VIEWS OF THE YEAR WITH MILLIONS TUNING IN TO WATCH LIVE AT 5AM IN AMERICA. IF THIS EVENT IS GIVEN A BIG ENOUGH BUILD THEN MANY WILL TUNE IN TO WATCH THIS ALSO. THE THOUGHT NOW IS THAT YET AGAIN BIG SHOW WILL FIGHT FOR THE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP AT NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS BEFORE THERE IS SOME PREPARATION FOR THIS MATCH. WHETHER OR NOT THE BUILD WILL BE PART OF RAW OR SMACKDOWN STILL REMAINS TO BE SEEN. IF BROCK LESNAR ISN'T THE GUY TO RETIRE BIG SHOW THEN WHO IS? WHO ELSE COULD WWE POSSIBLY BRING BACK TO DO THE HONORS? HAVE YOUR SAY IN THE COMMENTS SECTION BELOW... DO YOU WANT TO WRITE FOR GIVEMESPORT?

198	ATTRACTIVE YIELD AND HIGHER SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PRICE OUT PRIVATE SECTOR BORROWERS DUBAI: THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF) SAID THAT THE SAUDI ARABIAS PLAN TO MEET LARGE FISCAL DEFICITS THROUGH DEBT FINANCING WILL HELP SLOW THE EROSION OF GOVERNMENT DEPOSITS IN THE BANKING SYSTEM, AND BUILD A YIELD CURVE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS. BUT THE IMF ALONG WITH BANKING ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT BORROWING PROGRAMME COULD RESULT IN A SHARP CHANGE IN THE ASSET MIX OF BANKS WITH BANKS INCREASINGLY FAVOURING GOVERNMENT ISSUES. ATTRACTIVE YIELD AND HIGHER SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PRICE OUT PRIVATE SECTOR BORROWERS AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT RESULTING IN HIGHER BORROWING COSTS FOR PRIVATE BORROWERS. WE EXPECT CORPORATE BANK LOAN PRICING IN SAUDI ARABIA TO INCREASE AS THE SOVEREIGN ISSUANCE ABSORBS THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE BANKING SYSTEM, SAID TREVOR CULLINAN, AN ANALYST AT STANDARD & POORS. ALTHOUGH PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING HAD GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST DECADE, THE YIELD COMPRESSION IN THE POST FINANCIAL CRISIS YEARS HAS RESULTED IN DECLINING APPETITE FOR PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING. SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2009, GLOBAL AND LOCAL INTEREST RATES HAVE DECLINED SHARPLY TO HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS. NET INTEREST MARGINS (NIMS) FOR SAUDI BANKS HAVE VISIBLY SHRUNK IN THE PAST FEW YEARS IN LINE WITH DECLINING LENDING PRICES AND LOW INTEREST RATES, TO 2.9 PER CENT LAST YEAR FROM 3.9 PER CENT IN 2009. OWING TO INCREASED COMPETITION, CORPORATE PRICING HAS SOFTENED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST FEW YEARS RESULTING IN VISIBLE MARGIN EROSION FOR THE BANKS. AS A RESULT, THE NIM OF RATED SAUDI BANKS CONTRACTED 100 BASIS POINTS ON AGGREGATE BETWEEN 2008 AND 2014. WE NOW EXPECT A REVERSAL IN THIS TREND BECAUSE THE BANKS WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE RETURNS ON ZERO-RISK-WEIGHTED GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, SAID TIMUCIN ENGIN, AN ANALYST WITH S&P. THE RATING AGENCY EXPECTS DEPOSIT GROWTH TO VISIBLY SLOWDOWN IN THE COMING QUARTERS DUE TO LOW OIL PRICES AND WE EXPECT BANKS SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY BUFFERS TO GRADUALLY TIGHTEN. SAUDI BANKS ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE THEIR BALANCE SHEET ALLOCATION TO OTHER EXPOSURES TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE SOVEREIGN ISSUANCE. S & P EXPECTS THE BANKS TO VISIBLY REDUCE THEIR LIQUID ASSET EXPOSURES OVER THE NEXT FEW QUARTERS. THE AVERAGE YIELD ON THE RECENT 10-YEAR SAUDI ISSUANCE IS 265 BPS OR 49 BPS OVER US TREASURIES, WHILE SAUDI BANKS GENERATE LESS THAN 15 BPS BLENDED YIELD ON THEIR INTERBANK PLACEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES. THIS MEANS THE BANKS SHOULD SEE A VISIBLE INCREASE IN ASSET DURATION. WE EXPECT TO SEE THE BANKS APPETITE FOR PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING GRADUALLY DECLINE. SINCE 2003, PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING HAS GROWN FROM A BASE OF 42 PER CENT OF SYSTEM ASSETS TO 60 PER CENT, AS BANKS PLACED THE LIQUIDITY FROM MATURING GOVERNMENT SECURITIES INTO OTHER YIELD-GENERATING ASSETS. THIS SHIFT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE ACCELERATION IN THE GOVERNMENTS CAPITAL SPENDING, WHICH FUELLED GROWTH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR ACROSS VARIOUS ECONOMIC SEGMENTS, SAID ENGIN.
199	ANDROID MARKET SHARE STAYS STEADY IN US BUT SINKS DEEPER IN EUROPE MORE THAN A QUARTER OF SMARTPHONE BUYERS ACROSS EUROPE JUMPED SHIP FROM ANDROID TO IOS, WHICH SAW SOLID GAINS ACROSS MOST OF THE CONTINENT, SAYS RESEARCH FIRM KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH. BY LANCE WHITNEY @LANCEWHIT SEPTEMBER 2, 2015 8:03 AM PDT UPDATED: SEPTEMBER 2, 2015 8:03 AM PDT ANDROID REMAINS TOP DOG AROUND THE WORLD BUT CONTINUES TO SHED MARKET SHARE IN EUROPE. CNET ANDROID REMAINS BY FAR THE TOP MOBILE OS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, BUT ITS MARKET SHARE CONTINUES TO LOSE GROUND EXCEPT IN THE US. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY, ANDROID'S SLICE OF THE SMARTPHONE MARKET FOR THE TOP FIVE EUROPEAN NATIONS (FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, SPAIN AND THE UK) DROPPED BY 4.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 71 PERCENT FROM 75.1 PERCENT FOR THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO, KANTAR REPORTED ON WEDNESDAY. THE CHANGES IN MARKET SHARE VARIED ACROSS THE BOARD. ANDROID'S SHARE TUMBLED BY 8.7 POINTS IN GERMANY AND 5.4 POINTS IN FRANCE BUT INCHED DOWN JUST 1.5 POINTS IN ITALY AND ACTUALLY GAINED ALMOST A POINT IN SPAIN. BUT IN THE US, ANDROID'S MARKET SHARE GREW BY 1.7 POINTS TO 65.6 PERCENT FROM 63.9 PERCENT DURING THE SAME THREE MONTHS IN 2014. THE SITUATION WAS THE REVERSE FOR APPLE'S IOS. THE IPHONE'S MARKET SHARE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY GREW BY 2.5 POINTS ACROSS EUROPE'S TOP FIVE COUNTRIES TO REACH 17 PERCENT. APPLE'S SMARTPHONE MARKET SHARE DECLINED BY 1.3 PERCENT IN THE US, THOUGH WAS LOWER THAN THE 2.3 PERCENT DROP FOR THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS. WHY IS ANDROID LOSING GROUND IN EUROPE BUT STAYING STEADY IN THE US, WHILE APPLE'S IOS IS DOING THE OPPOSITE? THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS, CAROLINA MILANESI, CHIEF OF RESEARCH AT KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH, TOLD CNET. THE SMARTPHONE MARKET IN EUROPE IS FACING CHALLENGING CONDITIONS. CERTAIN FLAGSHIP PHONES, SUCH AS SAMSUNG'S GALAXY S6, HAVE RECEIVED A MUTED RESPONSE FROM BUYERS. ALSO, SAMSUNG AND OTHER ANDROID PLAYERS ARE FACING INCREASED COMPETITION FROM LOCAL VENDORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN CHINA. ANOTHER REASON IS THE MATURITY OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET AS EVIDENCED BY FEWER FIRST-TIME SMARTPHONE BUYERS, ACCORDING TO KANTAR. THAT TYPE OF MATURITY INCREASES THE CHURN RATE, MEANING THE RATE AT WHICH EXISTING SMARTPHONE BUYERS SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM. AND IN EUROPE, THAT HIT ANDROID HARDER THAN IT DID APPLE. "THIS TYPE OF MARKET MATURITY INCREASES THE IMPACT OF CHURN ON OVERALL PERFORMANCE AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH ANDROID THIS TIME AROUND -- 27 PERCENT OF SMARTPHONE BUYERS ACROSS EUROPE LEFT ANDROID FOR IOS VERSUS 9 PERCENT IN THE US," DOMINIC SUNNEBO, BUSINESS UNIT DIRECTOR AT KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH EUROPE, SAID IN A PRESS RELEASE. SWITCHING TO A DIFFERENT CARRIER TYPICALLY OCCURS LESS IN THE US THAN IN EUROPE. THAT'S BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE IN THE US ARE ON CONTRACT OR INSTALLMENT PLANS, WHILE MANY OF THOSE IN EUROPE ARE ON PREPAID PLANS, WHICH LEAD TO LONGER REPLACEMENT CYCLES. "I ALSO FEEL THAT THE 'I AM AN APPLE' AND 'I AM AN ANDROID' GROUPS ARE MORE CLEARLY DEFINED [IN THE US] THAN IN EUROPE," MILANESE ADDED. IN THE UNITED STATES, APPLE'S ANDROID RIVALS PROVIDED A TOUGHER FIGHT THAN THEY DID IN EUROPE. APPLE AND SAMSUNG STILL REIGN SUPREME IN THE US. BUT OTHER VENDORS SUCH AS LG HAVE GAINED MARKET SHARE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF NEW MOBILE DATA PLANS ON MID-RANGE PHONES, MILANESI TOLD CNET IN AUGUST. EARLY DEMAND FOR THE IPHONE IN THE US WAS STRONG, SO SALES WOULD NATURALLY BE LEVELING OFF BY THIS POINT, ESPECIALLY WITH APPLE DUE TO UNVEIL ITS NEXT IPHONE LINEUP ON SEPTEMBER 9. THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE AN OFF-YEAR FOR THE IPHONE IN WHICH APPLE INTRODUCES INTERIM MODELS -- THE IPHONE 6S AND IPHONE 6S PLUS -- WITH PERHAPS ONE OR TWO MAJOR NEW FEATURES BUT MOSTLY MINOR UPGRADES IN PROCESSOR SPEED AND A FEW OTHER FACTORS. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IPHONE SALES WILL SUFFER, ESPECIALLY IF APPLE LOWERS THE PRICE ON THE CURRENT IPHONE 6 LINEUP. "WHILE ALL EYES WILL BE ON APPLE'S NEW PRODUCTS, I WOULD SUGGEST PEOPLE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CURRENT IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS MARKET PERFORMANCE, SHOULD THE ACCUSTOMED PRICE DROP OCCUR AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 9 PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT," MILANESE SAID. "IN THE U.S., 32 PERCENT OF THE OVERALL SALES OF THE IPHONE 5S WERE GENERATED AFTER THE LAUNCH OF THE IPHONE 6." AND HOW DID ANDROID AND APPLE FARE ACROSS OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD? IN CHINA, ANDROID'S SMARTPHONE SHARE DROPPED BY 5.5 POINTS, WHILE THE IPHONE'S SLICE ROSE BY 5.9 POINTS. CHINA'S SMARTPHONE MARKET HAS WEAKENED AS OF LATE DUE TO OVERSATURATION, BUT THE IPHONE IS STILL A HOT DEVICE. FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, APPLE REPORTED THAT SALES IN GREATER CHINA MORE THAN DOUBLED TO $13.2 BILLION. IN AUSTRALIA, ANDROID'S SHARE PLUMMETED BY 10.5 POINTS TO 56.1 PERCENT, WHILE APPLE'S CUT ROSE BY 7.9 PERCENT TO 34.9 PERCENT. AND IN JAPAN, ANDROID'S SLICE OF THE MARKET DROPPED BY 7 POINTS, WHILE APPLE'S INCREASED BY 6.3 POINTS.

202	MISTAKES ARE A NORMAL PHENOMENON IN LIFE. ALL HAVE, AT ONE TIME OR THE OTHER, COMMITTED A MISTAKE. SOME ARE DUE TO IGNORANCE, WHILE OTHERS ARE DUE TO SHEER FOOLHARDINESS. GENERALLY, WE TEND TO LEARN LESSONS FROM OUR MISTAKES, WHICH IN TURN HELP TO IMPROVE UPON OUR SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS IN LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR. WHILE SOME CONTINUALLY MAKE MISTAKES AND GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE LEARNING FROM THEM, LIFE DOES NOT AFFORD OTHERS THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY. A SINGLE MISTAKE FROM SUCH PERSONS IS ENOUGH TO LEAD TO YEARS OF SUFFERING. SOMETIMES A SINGLE MISTAKE IS ENOUGH TO LEAD THEM TO ETERNAL DAMNATION. THERE IS THIS TRAGIC STORY THAT I NEVER CEASE TO TELL MY STUDENTS. IT WAS ABOUT A BLOKE CALLED ELVIS. HE CAME FROM A POOR FAMILY BUT WAS SUCH A BRILLIANT, RESPECTFUL AND HARDWORKING STUDENT. HIS AMBITION WAS TO BECOME EITHER A DOCTOR OR AN ENGINEER. HE HAD HIS BASIC EDUCATION IN ONE OF THE REMOTEST PARTS OF THE VOLTA REGION BUT MANAGED TO MAKE SIX ONES. HIS AMBITION SEEMED TO BE ON COURSE WHEN HE GAINED ADMISSION INTO ONE OF THE BEST SCIENCE SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY. HE WON MANY ACADEMIC AWARDS IN THE SCHOOL DUE TO HIS DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK. IT WAS WHILE HE WAS AWAITING HIS SECONDARY SCHOOL RESULTS THAT A SINGLE MISTAKE LED TO HIS TRAGIC END. HE HAD A COUSIN WHO WAS A BICYCLE REPAIRER. BEING A VERY HARDWORKING BLOKE, HE DECIDED TO USE HIS HOLIDAYS TO LEARN BICYCLE REPAIRS FROM THE COUSIN. THE COUSIN WAS HOWEVER A BELIEVER IN THE EFFICACY OF THE GANJA HERB, POPULARLY KNOWN AS INDIAN HEMP. ONE DAY IN HIS BID TO CONVINCE THE COUSIN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO GAIN FROM GANJA , HE FOOLISHLY ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE TO SMOKE A ROLL OF THE HERB TO DISPROVE THE BELIEF THAT IT WAS EFFICACIOUS. AND THAT WAS HIS DOOM! SOON AFTER HE FINISHED SMOKING, HIS MIND STARTED PLAYING GAMES WITH HIM AND HE STARTED ACTING IN A FUNNY WAY. THAT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE, CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT HE HAD HITHERTO NOT EVEN SMOKED A CIGARETTE. IN THAT SCHIZOPHRENIC STATE, HE RUSHED HOME. HE MISTOOK A BOTTLE OF ACID GIVEN TO HIM FOR SAFEKEEPING FOR A MINERAL AND GULPED THE CONTENT. THE RESULT WAS A HUGE TRAGEDY. THE CORROSIVE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE DID NOT GIVE HIM ANY CHANCE OF SURVIVAL. HE JOINED HIS ANCESTORS IN SAMANFOLAND BEFORE THEY COULD REACH A MEDICAL FACILITY. BUT THAT WAS AFTER HE HAD HAD TO ENDURE SEVERE PAIN AND SUFFERING. MY POINT IS THAT A SINGLE MISTAKE COULD LEAD TO A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT MAY LEAD TO ONES DOOM. AS THE HEADING MAY HAVE HINTED, MY FOCUS IS ON THOSE RIDING ON THE GREAT ELEPHANT. BEING A HUMAN INSTITUTION, THE OSONO MAY HAVE MADE SOME MISTAKES IN THE PAST AND LEARNT LESSONS FROM THEM. BUT TRUST ME; ITS LATEST MISTAKE IS A VERY GRAVE ONE AND COULD GRADUALLY LEAD TO ITS UNDOING. THE CHOICE OF PAUL AFOKO AND KWABENA AGYAPONG AS CHAIRMAN AND GENERAL SECRETARY RESPECTIVELY IS WHAT I REFER TO. I DID SUPPORT KWABENAS BID DURING THE PARTY CONTEST, BUT HINDSIGHT HAS MADE ME WISER. AS FOR AFOKO, I SUSPECTED HE WOULD BE A DISASTER SO I THREW MY WEIGHT BEHIND A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE. AS WE ALL KNOW, AFOKO DID WIN THE CONTEST; AND IM SAD TO SAY HE HAS SO FAR PROVED ME RIGHT. MY RELIGIOUS UPBRINGING DOES NOT PERMIT ME TO ACCUSE OTHERS OF ILL-MOTIVE WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE, SO I WOULD NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THE AGENDA 2020 OPERATION THE DUO IS BEING ACCUSED OF. BUT THEIR ACTIONS SINCE ASSUMING OFFICE HAVE LEFT NO DOUBT IN MANY MINDS THAT THEIR SELECTION WAS A GRAVE MISTAKE. THE BELLIGERENT ATTITUDE OF THE DUO TOWARDS THE OTHER PARTY OFFICIALS HAS CONTINUALLY HEIGHTENED TENSIONS AMONG THE RANK AND FILE. SOME UNILATERAL ACTIONS OF THEIRS WHICH READILY COME TO MIND ARE THE ABORTIVE DISMISSAL OF MARTIN ADJEI KORSAH AND THE CHANGING OF SECURITY GUARDS AT THE PARTYS HEADQUARTERS, WHICH LED TO ARMED ALTERCATIONS AMONG PARTY FOLKS IN FULL GLARE OF THE MEDIA. THE HEIGHTENED TENSIONS THAT LED TO THE UNFORTUNATE ACID-POURING SAGA WERE AVOIDABLE. THE I-AM-EATING-FUFU EPISODE BY KWABENA HAS DONE THE PARTY MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THE RECENT ORCHESTRATION TO TARNISH THE IMAGE OF SOME PARTY OFFICIALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING INTERNAL CORRUPTION HAS ALSO GIVEN RISE TO MANY QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. WHY IS THE DUO SILENT ON THE ALLEGATION OF A SECRET ECOBANK ACCOUNT, WHEN THEY KNOW TOO WELL THAT THE ACCOUNT HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR CLOSE TO SEVEN YEARS? WHY DID THEY REFUSE TO SIGN THE ECOBANK SIGNATURE FORM, ONLY TO TURNAROUND TO ISSUE PRESS STATEMENTS PURPORTING TO FIGHT CORRUPTION? AND WHAT WAS THE REAL MOTIVE FOR THE PRESS RELEASE? FOR SURE, THE SECRET ACCOUNT ALLEGATION AND THE ILL-TIMED PRESS STATEMENT HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR PURPOSE. THEY HAVE INDEED TAKEN THE SHINE OFF NANA ADDOS ARISE AND BUILD TOUR AND BROUGHT NEGATIVE STORIES ABOUT THE PARTY BACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT. DID I HEAR YOU SAY SABOTAGE? I DONT KNOW WHAT NANA ADDO IS THINKING. BUT IF I WERE HIM, I WOULD BE THINKING OF HOW TO CORRECT THE GRAVE MISTAKE THE PARTY MADE IN TAMALE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM, THIS IS ONE OF THE RARE MISTAKES THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO RECTIFY. HMM, COULD THIS BE THE MISTAKE TO LEAD THE PARTY TO ETERNAL DAMNATION? MASSA, WITH SUCH HIGH LEVELS OF INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION BEING DISPLAYED BY THE SO-CALLED RESURRECTED GOAT AND HIS CRONIES, I SHUDDER TO IMAGINE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF MISRULE UNDER SUCH CONFUSED GOATS.

204	(CNN) - IT'S A PERFECT FALL DAY AS OUR VAN MAKES THE 30-MINUTE DRIVE FROM CENTRAL PYONGYANG TO JANG CHON COOPERATIVE FARM. WE ASK IF OUR PHOTOGRAPHER CAN FILM OUT OF THE WINDOW AS WE PASS THE ROLLING FIELDS THAT WILL SOON BE READY TO HARVEST. "NOT YET," ONE OFFICIAL TELLS US. "WE'RE ALMOST THERE." WHEN IT COMES TO FARMING IN NORTH KOREA, SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER ARE TYPICALLY THE MOST ABUNDANT MONTHS. FROM WHAT WE'RE SEEING, FARMS ARE BUSY. WINTER IS COMING AND NORTH KOREANS WILL SOON STOCK UP ON KOREAN CABBAGE USED TO MAKE KIMCHI, THE DELICIOUS FERMENTED SIDE DISH THAT IS A STAPLE OF THE KOREAN DIET YEAR-ROUND, BUT ESPECIALLY DURING THE WINTER MONTHS. SOME WILL USE HUNDREDS OF HEADS OF CABBAGE IN THE ANNUAL KIMCHI MAKING RITUAL, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO LAST THROUGH WINTER INTO SPRING. FOR MANY, A WEAK HARVEST MEANS LESS FOOD, ESPECIALLY IN MAY JUST BEFORE BARLEY SEASON. AS WE PULL INTO THE CO-OP FARM, WE SPOT THE ROWS OF GREENHOUSES THAT NORTH KOREA HOPES WILL REDUCE AND ELIMINATE SEASONAL FOOD SHORTAGES THAT CONTINUE TO AFFECT LARGE PORTIONS OF THE POPULATION. WE SPOT A LARGE, COLORFUL MURAL OF NORTH KOREAN FOUNDER KIM IL SUNG, A MAN WHOSE PORTRAIT IS OMNIPRESENT IN EVERY HOME AND PUBLIC BUILDING. KIM, WHO STILL HOLDS THE TITLE OF ETERNAL PRESIDENT MORE THAN 20 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH, IS PORTRAYED ON THE MURAL WEARING HIS TRADEMARK SUIT STANDING IN A CABBAGE FIELD AMONGST SMILING FARMERS. THE MURAL IS ALMOST THE ONLY RECOGNIZABLE FEATURE OF THE ORIGINAL COOPERATIVE FARMING VILLAGE, WHICH RECENTLY UNDERWENT A DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION. THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED ON THE ORDERS OF SUPREME LEADER KIM JONG UN -- THE CURRENT KIM -- WHO ENVISIONED A FARM OF THE FUTURE. AN AVERAGE OF 4,000 WORKERS PER DAY, INCLUDING TROOPS FROM THE KOREAN PEOPLE'S ARMY, WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK, EVEN DURING THE HARSH WINTER MONTHS, TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT AT "CHOLLIMA SPEED," A REFERENCE TO THE MYTHICAL WINGED HORSE THAT SYMBOLIZES THE RAPID ADVANCE OF KOREAN SOCIETY. MODEL VILLAGE WITH ALL THOSE RESOURCES POURED INTO IT, THE IMPROVEMENTS GO FAR BEYOND THE SPRAWLING, IRRIGATED FIELDS AND THE SEA OF 665 GREENHOUSES. THERE ARE ROWS OF BRAND NEW HOUSING UNITS, COMPLETE WITH SPACIOUS APARTMENTS WITH NEW KITCHENS, PATIOS, AND PRIVATE BATHROOMS. COOKING IS DONE OUTSIDE USING PROPANE GAS IN THE WARMER MONTHS, AND INSIDE ON BURNERS BUILT INTO THE FLOOR DURING THE COLD SEASON. LIKE MOST NORTH KOREAN HOMES TODAY, THERE ARE NUMEROUS SOLAR PANELS TO REDUCE THE DRAIN ON THE NATION'S POWER GRID AND PROVIDE BACKUP POWER DURING FREQUENT ELECTRICITY SHORTAGES. WE VISIT A NEWLY BUILT NURSERY SCHOOL THAT HAS A MEDICAL CLINIC, SPRING WATER BATHING ROOM, INDOOR AND OUTDOOR WADING POOLS, MUSIC INSTRUCTION AND PLAYROOMS FULL OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND TOY MISSILE LAUNCHERS, MINI-VERSIONS OF THE LARGER MILITARY HARDWARE THAT WILL ROLL THROUGH THE STREETS OF PYONGYANG FOR THE UPCOMING OCTOBER 10 PARTY FOUNDATION DAY CELEBRATIONS. WE VISIT CLASSROOMS FULL OF COSTUMED, SINGING CHILDREN PREPARING THEIR OWN PERFORMANCES FOR THE EVENT. THERE IS A ROLLER-SKATING RINK, A FISHING POND THEY TELL US IS STOCKED WITH UP TO 56,000 FISH, A MEDICAL CLINIC, AND EVEN A BEAUTY PARLOR. THERE IS ALSO A 646-SEAT AUDITORIUM -- THE STAGE ADORNED WITH TWO LARGE PORTRAITS OF THE LATE FOUNDER AND HIS SON KIM JONG IL. THE "FARMERS' THEATER" IS USED FOR IDEOLOGICAL STUDIES AND PERFORMANCES. MS. KIM AS WE TOUR THE VILLAGE, A WOMAN WITH A BOOMING VOICE AND EVEN LOUDER LAUGH APPROACHES OUR CREW WITH A SMILE. HER NAME IS KIM MYONG YON AND I'M TOLD SHE'S BEEN THE MANAGER OF THIS FARM FOR 47-YEARS, AND HAS LIVED IN THE FARMING VILLAGE FOR 51 YEARS. AT 69, SHE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. WITH HER COMMANDING PRESENCE AND ALL-CONSUMING ENTHUSIASM FOR THE NORTH KOREAN LEADERS, SHE QUICKLY TAKES CONTROL OF OUR TOUR FROM THE PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER ASSIGNED TO SHOW US AROUND. I CONGRATULATE HER ON THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED VILLAGE. "IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THE LEADER!" SHE SAYS ENTHUSIASTICALLY. SHE TAKES US TO ONE OF NORTH KOREA'S VERY FIRST GREENHOUSES, FIRST VISITED BY KIM IL SUNG MORE THAN THREE DECADES AGO AND AGAIN RECENTLY BY HIS GRANDSON. THIS GREENHOUSE WAS A MODEL FOR THE INDOOR FARMING THAT ALLOWS NORTH KOREA TO GROW SOME VEGETABLES YEAR-ROUND. NORTH KOREA'S HUMID CONTINENTAL CLIMATE OF WARM SUMMERS AND COLD, DRY WINTERS AND MOSTLY MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN IS MORE SUITABLE FOR INDUSTRY THAN AGRICULTURE, SHE EXPLAINS. FOOD SHORTAGES SUPPLYING ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED THE COUNTRY'S 24 MILLION PEOPLE HAS LONG BEEN A STRUGGLE. KIM REMEMBERS WHENTHEY BARELY HAD SEEDS TO PLANT, FIRST AFTER THE KOREAN WAR AND AGAIN DURING THE GREAT FAMINE OF THE 1990S WHEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DIED OF STARVATION. THE FAMINE WAS CAUSED BY A "PERFECT STORM" OF NATURAL DISASTER, ECONOMIC CRISIS ATTRIBUTED TO A U.S.-LED ECONOMIC BLOCKADE AND NORTH KOREAN FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT, AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET BLOC, THAT DRAMATICALLY SLASHED THE AMOUNT OF AID ENTERING THE COUNTRY. "WE HAD NO FERTILIZER, NO ELECTRICITY, WE HAD TO EAT GRASS PORRIDGE," KIM SAYS. "WE REALLY STRUGGLED TO SURVIVE." KIM SAYS POVERTY WAS A WAY OF LIFE AT THE FARM VILLAGE. BUT SHE PROUDLY PROCLAIMS THE STRUGGLES ARE OVER, AND INVITES US TO RETURN NEXT FALL WHEN SHE PROMISES TO THROW US A PARTY. "OUR DREAM HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BY THE LEADER," KIM SAYS. "IN THE OLD DAYS, WE WERE SO POOR, SO BARREN. WE NEVER IMAGINED WE'D GROW THIS MANY VEGETABLES." THE CO-OP IS CONSIDERED A MODEL FOR NORTH KOREA'S 2,000 OTHER FARMS, WHOSE MANAGERS WERE BROUGHT HERE TO TOUR THE FACILITIES AND ATTEMPT TO DUPLICATE THE SYSTEM BACK IN THEIR HOME PROVINCES. JANG CHON IS LEAPS AND BOUNDS AHEAD OF THE MAJORITY OF NORTH KOREAN FARMS. THE FARM'S SENIOR MANAGERS SAY THE NEW VILLAGE WILL BE USED A PROTOTYPE FOR OTHER FARMING COMMUNITIES. DESPITE RECENT GAINS, THE U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME SAYS NORTH KOREA STILL STRUGGLES TO PRODUCE ENOUGH FOOD FOR ITS 24-MILLION PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO AN APRIL 2015, U.N. HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND PRIORITIES REPORT, 70% OF THE POPULATION IS "FOOD INSECURE AND HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO SHORTAGES IN FOOD PRODUCTION." NEW 'FREE MARKETS' IN AN APPARENT EFFORT TO BOOST PRODUCTIVITY, NORTH KOREAN FARMERS ARE NOW ALLOWED TO KEEP ANY SURPLUS FOOD TO SELL OR TRADE ON THE GROWING NETWORK OF FREE MARKETS, WHICH ALLOW EXPATS LIVING IN COUNTRY AND NORTH KOREA'S SMALL BUT GROWING MIDDLE CLASS TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL FOOD BEYOND GOVERNMENT-PROVIDED RATIONS. PREVIOUSLY, ANY SURPLUS WAS TURNED OVER TO THE STATE. THE CHANGES GIVE FARMERS AN INCENTIVE TO GROW MORE FOOD THAN THE STATE QUOTA, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO CHINA'S MARKET-BASED AGRICULTURAL REFORMS THAT BEGAN IN THE LATE 1970S AND EARLY 8
205	UPDATED - NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OFFSPRING. FOR EXAMPLE, BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS. DATE: SEPTEMBER 22, 2015 SOURCE: ELIFE SUMMARY: NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OFFSPRING.  IT SERVES AS VALUABLE GUIDANCE FOR THE HEALTH CARE AGENT WHEN THE AGENT IS MAKING A DECISION. FOR EXAMPLE, BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS. SHARE: A NEW STUDY CARRIED OUT WITH BURYING BEETLES ALSO SHOWS THAT BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS. THE RESEARCH WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL ELIFE. "PARENTS OBVIOUSLY PLAY A HUGE ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR OFFSPRING," SAYS LEAD RESEARCHER PROFESSOR REBECCA KILNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. "THE AIM OF OUR STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE NON-GENETIC WAYS THAT PARENTS ACHIEVE THIS." THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE COULD SPEED UP THE RATE AT WHICH ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR EVOLVES AND ADAPTS IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD. WHETHER EXAMINING MOTHERS OR FATHERS, THE RESEARCH TEAM FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT RECEIVED NO CARE AS LARVAE WERE LESS EFFECTIVE AT RAISING A LARGE BROOD AS PARENTS, AND DIED YOUNGER. IN CONTRAST, HIGH QUALITY CARE NOT ONLY PRODUCES A LARGER BROOD, BUT INDIVIDUAL OFFSPRING WITH A HIGHER MASS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES. "WE FOUND THAT PARENTAL CARE PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE. GOOD QUALITY PARENTS PRODUCE OFFSPRING THAT BECOME GOOD PARENTS THEMSELVES, WHILE OFFSPRING THAT RECEIVE POOR PARENTING THEN BECOME LOW QUALITY PARENTS. OUR EXPERIMENTS SHOW HOW PARENTAL CARE ALLOWS OFFSPRING TO INHERIT CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR PARENTS, BUT NON-GENETICALLY," SHE SAYS. HOWEVER, THE TEAM ALSO FOUND THAT OFFSPRING PAY A COST FOR RECEIVING HIGH QUALITY CARE, BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION IF THEY PAIR UP WITH A LOWER QUALITY PARTNER. THIS MAY EXPLAIN WHY ANIMALS OFTEN CHOOSE A MATE THAT IS WILLING TO PUT IN A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF EFFORT AS THEM AS A PARENT. IN THIS WAY, THEY ARE LESS VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION. THE BURYING BEETLE, NICROPHORUS VESPILLOIDES, USES THE CARCASS OF A SMALL VERTEBRATE SUCH AS A MOUSE AS AN EDIBLE NEST FOR ITS YOUNG. AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS, A BREEDING PAIR BURIES THE CARCASS AND PRESERVES IT WITH AN ANTIBACTERIAL SECRETION. THE MOTHER LAYS EGGS NEARBY IN THE SOIL, AND THE LARVAE CRAWL TO THE CARCASS WHEN THEY HATCH. ALTHOUGH THE LARVAE CAN FEED THEMSELVES, THEY ALSO BEG BOTH PARENTS FOR PARTLY-DIGESTED FOOD FROM THE CARCASS.  THE REMAINING PROJECTS EITHER HAVE BEEN COMPLETED OR HAVE EXPECTED IN-SERVICE DATES IN 2015. IN THE CURRENT STUDY, WHEN MALES WERE PAIRED WITH FEMALES THAT HAD RECEIVED NO POST-HATCHING CARE AS LARVAE, THEY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER LIVES THAN THOSE WHOSE PARTNERS HAD RECEIVED MORE CARE. THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT MALES WITH LOW QUALITY PARTNERS PUT MORE EFFORT INTO PARENTAL DUTIES TO COMPENSATE FOR THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THEIR MATE, AND PAID THE PRICE BY DYING YOUNGER.

206	REVISE: A STATE-OF-THE-ART JOBS WEBSITE WILL HELP MATCH JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS, THE TNAISTE AND MINISTER FOR SOCIAL PROTECTION, JOAN BURTON T.D., HAS SAID. THE TNAISTE TODAY (FRIDAY, 18 SEPTEMBER 2015) ANNOUNCED THAT THE CONTRACT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF THE NEW JOBSIRELAND.IE WEBSITE HAS BEEN AWARDED TO BDO IRELAND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AN IRISH TECH START-UP - THE HIRE LAB BASED IN CARRIGALINE, CO. CORK. THE CONTRACT WHICH IS VALUED AT SOME 4.5M WILL LEAD TO THE CREATION OF UP TO 25 HIGH SKILLED JOBS IN THE HIRE LAB AND WILL DELIVER A FREE, CUTTING-EDGE RECRUITMENT AND EMPLOYMENT WEBSITE FOR USE BY JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS THROUGHOUT IRELAND. THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE IN THE PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL ROOM AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK, IN THE PRESENCE OF UCC VICE PRESIDENT, CAROLINE FENNELL. THE EXISTING JOBSIRELAND.IE WEBSITE, FIRST DEVELOPED IN THE LATE 1990S, IS TDHE LARGEST SUCH WEBSITE IN USE IN IRELAND WITH ALMOST 100,000 JOBS ADVERTISED IN 2014. ITS REPLACEMENT WILL IMPROVE SERVICES FOR JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS, INCLUDING: ENABLING JOBSEEKERS TO SUBMIT CVS AND APPLY FOR JOBS ON-LINE.  OPERATING IN THE BACKGROUND TO AUTOMATICALLY MATCH CANDIDATE CVS TO JOB SPECIFICATIONS POSTED BY EMPLOYERS, AND NOTIFYING CANDIDATES AND THE EMPLOYER WHEN SUCH A MATCH IS FOUND. INTEGRATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTIONS INTREO SERVICE IN SUPPORT OF PROGRAMMES SUCH AS COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT AND TS. THE TNAISTE SAID: TODAY IS ABOUT UNLOCKING POTENTIAL - ABOUT TRANSFORMING JOBSIRELAND.IE INTO A CUTTING-EDGE SERVICE THAT WILL BENEFIT BOTH JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE AS WE SPEED UP PROGRESS IN TACKLING UNEMPLOYMENT. ITS ABOUT UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY PERSON ON THE LIVE REGISTER TO RETURN TO WORK AND BUILD A BETTER FINANCIAL FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES, AND THEIR FAMILIES, OVER TIME. THE GOVERNMENT IS DRIVING A JOBS-LED RECOVERY THAT IS NOW ADDING 1,300 JOBS A WEEK, AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN BY A THIRD SINCE ITS CRISIS PEAK. BUT WEVE MORE TO DO. AND BDO IRELAND AND THE HIRE LAB WILL HELP US DO THAT THROUGH THIS VERY IMPORTANT CONTRACT. COMMENTING ON THE PROJECT, DERRY GRAY FROM BDO IRELAND STATED HIS DELIGHT THAT THE INNOVATIVE APPROACH PROPOSED BY THE COLLABORATION OF BDO AND THE HIRE LAB, WAS SELECTED AS THE PREFERRED BIDDER. THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE OF BDO AND THE HIRE LAB, IS A COLLABORATION OF TWO INDIGENOUS IRISH BUSINESSES, WHO WILL PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH A 21ST CENTURY SOLUTION TO THEIR JOBS AND RECRUITMENT PLATFORM. BEING AWARDED THIS CONTRACT IS A POSITIVE ENDORSEMENT OF IRISH INNOVATION IN THIS EXCITING AREA. OUR TEAM LOOKS FORWARD TO DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISE TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH A SOLUTION THAT NOT ONLY SATISFIES BUT EXCEEDS ITS TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS NEEDS. MAURICE BUCKLEY, CEO OF THE HIRE LAB COMMENTED, "WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTION ON SUCH A STRATEGIC PROJECT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DEPLOYING OUR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENTS' JOBS MATCHING AND VACANCY SERVICE. SECURING A PROJECT LIKE THIS, ALLOWS US TO CREATE 25 HIGHLY SKILLED POSITIONS DOUBLING OUR WORKFORCE IN CORK OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS." ENDS NOTE FOR EDITORS ABOUT XJOBSIRELAND AND THE NEW SERVICE WWW.JOBSIRELAND.IE IS A FREE ONLINE JOBS SITE DEVELOPED IN THE LATE 1990S THAT ENABLES EMPLOYERS TO POST JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBSEEKERS TO SEARCH AND APPLY FOR THESE OPPORTUNITIES ONLINE.  THE NEW SERVICE, WHICH IS SCNHEDULED TO GO LIVE BY THE END OF MARCH A2016, WILL UPGRADE THE EXISTING JOBSIRELAND.IE SERVICE AND WILL INTRODUCE ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY TO THE BENEFIT OF JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS. THE CURRENT JOBSIRELAND.IE SERVICE ENABLES JOBSEEKERS TO SEARCH FOR JOB OPPORTUNITIES BASED ON JOB TYPE, LOCATION AND SALARY. EMPLOYERS HOWEVER CANNOT SEARCH FOR SUITABLE JOBSEEKERS THEY HAVE TO RELY ON CANDIDATES FINDING AND APPLYING FOR THEIR JOB FROM AMONG THE MANY THOUSANDS HOSTED ON THE SYSTEM. THE NEW SERVICE WILL ENABLE BOTH EMPLOYERS AND JOBSEEKERS TO SEARCH FOR EACH OTHER USINGB COMPETENCIES AND SKILLSETS AS WELL AS THE TRADITIONAL JOB TYPE CLASSIFICATIONS. IT WILL ALSO OPERATE IN THE BACKGROUND TO AUTOMATICALLY MATCH CANDIDATE CVS TO JOB SPECIFICATIONS POSTED BY EMPLOYERS AND NOTIFY CANDIDATES AND THE EMPLOYER WHEN A MATCH IS FOUND. THE SYSTEM WILL ALSO ENABLE JOBSEEKERS TO SUBMIT CVS AND APPLY FOR JOBS ON-LINE AND WILL INTEGRATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTIONS INTREO SERVICE IN SUPPORT OF PROGRAMMES SUCH AS COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT, TS AND JOBBRIDGE, AND WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENTS CASE WORKERS TO TRACK AND SUPPORT JOBSEEKER EMPLOYMENT SEARCH ACTIVITY.

207	SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 13 2015 TEARS RAN DOWN THE FACE OF SHARMA LAKHAN, 63, AS HE RECALLED HOW, AT 21 YEARS OLD, HIS WIFE JUNNETTE INSPIRED IN HIM THE WILL TO SURVIVE AFTER LEARNING THAT HIS BOTH KIDNEYS HAD FAILED AND THERE WAS A HIGH POSSIBILITY THAT HE WOULD DIE. LAKHAN, ONE OF THE FIRST PERSONS IN THE CARIBBEAN TO RECEIVE A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT, LEARNED HE HAD A KIDNEY PROBLEM WHEN HE WAS JUST 17 YEARS OLD. NOW, HE BELIEVES GOD HAD A MISSION FOR HIM, TO GIVE OTHERS HOPE, LET THEM KNOW THAT LIFE WAS WORTH LIVING. GOD HAS EVERYTHING PLANNED. YOU MUST NOT BE AGAINST GOD IF YOU FIND THAT THINGS ARE NOT WORKING OUT THE WAY YOU THINK IT SHOULD. GOD MADE A PLAN FOR ME, TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AND GIVE OTHERS THE WILLPOWER AND INSPIRATION TO LIVE, HE SAID. AT AGE 17, LAKHAN HAD JUST RECEIVED HIS DRIVERS LICENCE WHEN HIS FATHER, RUDOLPH LAKHAN, DECIDED TO GET AN INSURANCE POLICY FOR HIS SON. THIS MEANT THAT HE HAD TO GET A CHECK UP FROM A DOCTOR. BLOOD WAS FOUND IN HIS URINE AND THE DOCTOR BELIEVED HIS KIDNEYS WERE FAILING BUT CONFIRMATION WAS NECESSARY. A BIOPSY ON HIS KIDNEY WAS PERFORMED AND THE SAMPLE WAS SENT TO ENGLAND FOR TESTS. HOWEVER, THE SAMPLE WAS CONTAMINATED BY THE TIME IT REACHED ENGLAND AND LAKHAN WAS TOO SCARED TO STAY AT THE HOSPITAL AS HE SAW THAT PEOPLE DIED IN THE BEDS AROUND HIM. THEREFORE HE GOT UP AND LEFT THE HOSPITAL WITHOUT RETURNING ALTHOUGH HE CONTINUED TO HAVE DISCOLOURED URINE, HEADACHES, AND LETHARGY. FOUR YEARS LATER, LAKHAN WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO HIS WIFE JUNNETTE. THEY HAD MET EACH OTHER AT WONGS HIGH SCHOOL IN ST JAMES AT THE AGE OF 16, AND HAD BEEN INSEPARABLE EVER SINCE. THEY HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE A DOUBLE WEDDING WITH LAKHANS BROTHER, NIRMAL LAKHAN AND HIS FIANCE MONA. HOWEVER, ONE DAY HE WOKE UP AND HIS SYMPTOMS WERE TOO SEVERE TO IGNORE, AND WITH THE ADDITIONAL SYMPTOM OF VOMITING, HE WAS TAKEN TO A DOCTOR FOR TEST. THE TESTS REVEALED LAKHAN WAS SUFFERING FROM KIDNEY FAILURE. THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM HE HAD NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL AS THERE WAS NO TREATMENT FOR THE CONDITION IN THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER, THE DOCTOR HAD HEARD THAT A NEPHROLOGIST FROM BOSTON, USA WAS IN SOUTH TRINIDAD SO THE LAKHAN FAMILY MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE DR RAM MAHABIR. LAKHAN WAS TOLD HE COULD EITHER LIVE ON DIALYSIS, OR GET A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT, NEITHER OF WHICH WAS AVAILABLE IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO. WITHOUT TREATMENT, HE WOULD HAVE TWO MONTHS TO LIVE SO HE HAD TO GO ABROAD. THE FAMILY ARRANGED FOR LAKHAN TO HAVE TESTS DONE AT NEW ENGLAND MEDICAL CENTRE IN BOSTON, WHICH HAD ONLY STARTED TO PERFORM TRANSPLANTS ONE YEAR PREVIOUSLY. IF HE COULD GET A KIDNEY, THE TRANSPLANT WOULD BE DONE. WITH HIS LIFE HANGING IN THE BALANCE AND HIS FUTURE UNSURE, LAKHAN SUGGESTED THAT THE WEDDING BE POSTPONED UNTIL AFTER THE SURGERY. HOWEVER JUNNETTE FORCEFULLY REJECTED THAT IDEA AND INSISTED THAT THEY BE MARRIED ON THE ORIGINAL DATE. SHE GAVE ME HOPE, THE INSPIRATION TO LIVE. WE WERE VERY YOUNG AND IN LOVE. I DONT THINK I WOULD HAVE LEFT TRINIDAD WITHOUT HER IN ANY CASE. THEN I HAD ALL THE SUPPORT OF MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY MY UNCLES, AUNTS, INLAWS. THEIR LOVE AND SUPPORT IS WHAT GOT ME THROUGH IT ALL, HE SAID. THEREFORE, THE COUPLE WAS MARRIED, ALONG WITH NIRMAL AND MONA, ON APRIL 28 1973, AT THE PORT-OF-SPAIN HINDU MANDIR IN ST JAMES. HOWEVER, LAKHAN WAS SO SICK THAT THE PUNDIT HAD TO HURRY THROUGH THE CEREMONY. I WAS TOO SICK FOR ANY HONEYMOON. MY WIFE MADE A LOT OF SACRIFICES, AND SHE STILL DOES. MY LOVE FOR HER GROWS EVERY SPLIT SECOND OF THE DAY, HE SAID. IN MAY OF THAT YEAR, THE FAMILY WENT TO BOSTON TO TEST WHETHER HIS FATHER OR BROTHER WERE COMPATIBLE KIDNEY DONORS. HE SAID THEY SPENT A LOT OF MONEY TRAVELLING FROM TRINIDAD TO BOSTON AND BACK, AS WELL AS FOR DIALYSIS AND THEN THE SURGERY. I WAS SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GIVE ME THEIR KIDNEYS, BOTH MY FATHER AND MY OLDER BROTHER. WHEN WE FOUND OUT MY FATHER WAS A BETTER MATCH, MY BROTHER WAS ACTUALLY DISAPPOINTED, HE SAID SMILING. THE OPERATIONS OF BOTH RUDOLPH AND HIS FATHER TOOK PLACE ON AUGUST 7. THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY FAMILY AND FRIENDS FROM ALL OVER THE US AS WELL AS TRINIDAD. LAKHAN STAYED IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 17 DAYS BUT HAD TO REMAIN IN BOSTON FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, MAKING WEEKLY OUTPATIENT VISITS, AND TAKING ANTI-REJECTION MEDICATION, WHICH HE HAS TO TAKE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. THE DRUGS WERE MAINLY STEROIDS, WHICH INCREASED HIS APPETITE AND HE PUT ON WEIGHT. HE SAID HE ATE AS MUCH AS HE COULD AND RARELY FOLLOWED DIETARY INSTRUCTIONS AS IT FELT SO GOOD TO EAT AND BE HEALTHY. AFTER I LEFT THE HOSPITAL I JUST APPRECIATED LIFE. SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS FEELING THE SUN ON MY BODY WAS WONDERFUL, HE SAID. LAKHAN RETURNED TO TRINIDAD IN NOVEMBER, FEELING STRONG AND HEALTHY. WHEN HE ARRIVED HOME IN ST JAMES, THERE WAS A LARGE PARTY TO WELCOME HIM WITH OVER 50 FRIENDS AND FAMILY, AS WELL AS LOCAL REPORTERS. THE PURPOSE OF PUTTING IT IN THE PAPERS WAS TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE WAS HELP ABROAD. THERE WAS NO HOPE HERE. PEOPLE STARTED COMING TO US FOR INFORMATION BECAUSE THEIR DOCTORS NEVER TOLD THEM THERE WAS HELP ABROAD, HE SAID. LAKHAN RETURNED TO WORK AT THE FAMILY BUSINESS, LAKHANS BAZZAR, AND IN 1978 HE AND HIS WIFE OPENED THEIR OWN BUSINESS, CHATTER BOX GIFT SHOP IN ST JAMES. THEY NOW HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AND FIVE GRANDCHILDREN. NOW, AT HIS AGE, LAKHAN IS WATCHING WHAT HE EATS - NO SOFT DRINKS, LOW SALT, AND LOTS OF WATER. I SEE HOW THEY (HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN) ARE WORRIED NOW SO IM TRYING TO BEHAVE. I REALLY LOVE WILD MEAT AND BEER BUT I HAVE TO SHOW THEM THAT I APPRECIATE ALL THEIR EFFORTS AND CARE, HE SAID. UNFORTUNATELY, LAKHANS FATHER, RUDOLPH, DIED TEN YEARS AGO. HE DESCRIBED HIS FATHER AS HIS HERO, AND A PILLAR OF THE FAMILY. HE SAID RUDOLPH TAUGHT HIM AND HIS BROTHERS PRINCIPLES AND VALUES, RIGHT FROM WRONG, AND HOW TO STAND ON THEIR OWN FEET. WE WERE VERY CLOSE. I CARRY HIM WITH ME. THIS PHYSICAL PART OF HIM IS WITH ME ALL THE TIME. I LOVE HIM AND MISS HIM A LOT. I TALK TO HIM AND TELL HIM HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM AND APPRECIATE THE SACRIFICES HE MADE FOR ME, HE SAID.
208	INTACT VASCULAR, INC., A DEVELOPER OF MEDICAL DEVICES FOR MINIMALLY INVASIVE PERIPHERAL VASCULAR PROCEDURES, TODAY ANNOUNCED THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS GRANTED CONDITIONAL APPROVAL FOR A U.S. AND EUROPEAN IDE CLINICAL TRIAL TO INVESTIGATE USE OF THE TACK ENDOVASCULAR SYSTEM AS A DISSECTION REPAIR THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE (P.A.D.) UNDERGOING PERCUTANEOUS ANGIOPLASTY. THE TACK OPTIMIZED BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY II (TOBA II) TRIAL HAS BEGUN WITH THE FIRST PATIENTS BEING TREATED AT YUMA REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER (YUMA, ARIZONA). WILLIAM A. GRAY, MD, DIRECTOR OF ENDOVASCULAR SERVICES, AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, IS PROVIDING STUDY LEADERSHIP AS THE NATIONAL PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR. THE TOBA II STUDY IS DESIGNED TO ENROLL 210 SUBJECTS AT 30-40 SITES IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. ALL STUDY SUBJECTS NEED TO BE SUFFERING FROM ADVANCED PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE IN ONE OR BOTH LEGS. THEY WILL BE TREATED WITH THE TACK ENDOVASCULAR SYSTEM FOLLOWING STANDARD BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY OR DRUG-COATED BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY IN THE SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL AND PROXIMAL POPLITEAL ARTERIES WHEN A DISSECTION (A TEAR IN THE ARTERY WALL) OCCURS (SEE WWW.TOBA-II.COM FOR DETAILS). THE TACK ENDOVASCULAR SYSTEM IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO REPAIR DISSECTIONS THAT FREQUENTLY OCCUR AS A COMPLICATION OF BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY. PUBLISHED LITERATURE REPORTS UP TO 88% 1 OF ANGIOPLASTY PROCEDURES HAVE DISSECTIONS. EARLIER THIS YEAR, PROMISING 12-MONTH RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS EUROPEAN TOBA STUDY WERE PRESENTED 2 AT A MAJOR VASCULAR CONFERENCE IN GERMANY AND DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL OF THE TACK IMPLANT FOR IMPROVING ARTERIAL HEALING FOLLOWING ANGIOPLASTY. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE SYSTEM ALLOWS PHYSICIANS TO REPAIR DISSECTIONS WHILE LEAVING A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF FOREIGN MATERIAL IN THE ARTERY, REDUCING MECHANICAL STRESS ON THE ARTERY, AND PRESERVING FUTURE TREATMENT OPTIONS. DR. GRAY STATED, THE EARLIER TOBA EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE LONG TERM RESULTS FROM ANGIOPLASTY CAN BE SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED IF WE REPAIR ARTERIAL DISSECTIONS USING THIS NEW APPROACH TO MINIMIZE VESSEL TRAUMA WHILE LEAVING AS LITTLE METAL BEHIND AS POSSIBLE. THE TACK IMPLANT SUPPORTS THE DISSECTION AND ALLOWS THE VESSEL TO HEAL, WHILE PRESERVING FUTURE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS. I AM VERY EXCITED THAT THE TOBA II TRIAL WILL ALLOW US TO STUDY THIS TECHNOLOGY IN COMBINATION WITH BOTH STANDARD AND DRUG-COATED ANGIOPLASTY BALLOONS A FIRST OF ITS KIND STUDY DESIGN. NO OTHER VASCULAR IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN METHODICALLY STUDIED FOLLOWING VESSEL TREATMENT WITH A DRUG-COATED BALLOON. THE FIRST PATIENTS IN THE TOBA II TRIAL WERE ENROLLED BY JOSEPH CARDENAS, M.D. AT YUMA REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER. DR. CARDENAS SAID, THIS NEW APPROACH OF SPOT TREATING DISSECTIONS SUPPORTS OUR DESIRE TO LEAVE AS LITTLE METAL BEHIND AS POSSIBLE. THE TACK IMPLANT IS ALSO UNIQUELY DESIGNED TO ADAPT TO THE DIAMETER OF THE VESSEL IN WHICH IT IS IMPLANTED, UNLIKE STENTS, WHICH HAVE TO BE SPECIFICALLY SIZED TO THE VESSEL. THIS MAKES THE PROCEDURE FAST, FLEXIBLE AND USER-FRIENDLY FOR THE HOSPITAL STAFF AND THE OPERATOR TO EFFICIENTLY TREAT OUR PATIENTS. BRUCE SHOOK, PRESIDENT AND CEO AT INTACT VASCULAR, STATED, WE ARE THRILLED BY THE ENTHUSIASM AND RESPONSIVENESS OF OUR CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS, PARTICULARLY DR. CARDENAS AND HIS TEAM AT YUMA. THE RAPID COMMENCEMENT OF THIS TRIAL HIGHLIGHTS THE CLINICAL NEED FOR A BETTER METHOD TO REPAIR ARTERIAL DISSECTIONS AND THE KEEN INTEREST CLINICIANS HAVE SHOWN IN A MINIMAL METAL SOLUTION TO THIS GROWING PROBLEM.

THE RADIUS IS TO KEEP THE AUDIENCE SAFE FROM THE BIG AND FLASHY MOVES, SUCH AS THE 8- AND 10-FOOT FLAMES SHOT FROM HIS MOTORCYCLE, THE 30- AND 40-FOOT CURLS STEMMING FROM HIS FLAMETHROWER AND TO KEEP THEM A REASONABLE DISTANCE FROM THE TALL FLAMES HE BREATHES. TORCH ALSO USES AN ARRAY OF NUNCHUCKS, A BULLWHIP AND A FIRE STAFF (THAT LOOKS LIKE A BATON) TO SPIN, CRACK AND WIELD FIRE IN CIRCLES, ARCS AND OTHER SHAPES. "WHEN YOU SAY 'FIRE SHOW,' YOU PICTURE SOMEONE DOING A VERY SLOW PACE," TORCH SAYS. "MOST [FIRE PERFORMERS] ARE WEIRD LOOKING DUDES TRYING TO LOOK SEXY [WHILE PERFORMING]. THEY HAVE THEIR SHIRT OFF AND HAVE LONG HAIR OR HAVE GIRLS IN HULA HOOPS. "A LOT OF THE FIRE PERFORMERS DO ONE THING AT A SLOW PACE AND CAN DRAG IT OUT FOR 5 OR 10 MINUTES." BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU GET WITH HIS SHOW, BECAUSE HE'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE FIRE PERFORMER. "MINE HAS LOTS OF ENERGY, WORKING THE CROWD AND GETTING LOTS OF ENERGY GOING," HE SAYS. "IT'S MORE IN-YOUR-FACE ... TO GET THE WHOLE CROWD'S ATTENTION." RATHER THAN A BIG, LONG SET, TORCH WILL DO VARIOUS ACTS, USUALLY AT 30 SECONDS TO A MINUTE EACH. ONCE SOMETHING STOPS BEING INTERESTING, HE STOPS DOING IT. HE FEEDS ON THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CROWD AND EXERTS SO MUCH ENERGY WITH EACH PERFORMANCE THAT HE USUALLY FEELS SICK AFTERWARD, FROM ALL THE EFFORT SPENT AND THE HIGH DEMAND IT PUTS ON HIS BODY. WHILE DOING A SHOW, "TO PUMP UP ENERGY, I'LL BE RUNNING AROUND LIKE A MANIAC," HE SAYS. BUT THE TECHNIQUE OF EATING FIRE TAKES DISCIPLINE, INCLUDING HIGH CONTROL OF HIS BREATHING. GOING FULL THROTTLE TO AN INSTANT STOP MEANS A LOT OF PRACTICE. TORCH GOT HIS START IN 2009 WHEN HE LEARNED HOW TO USE BASIC FIRE PERFORMING EQUIPMENT FROM A FIRE-EATING GO-GO DANCER AT A DALLAS NIGHTCLUB, WHERE HE WORKED. AFTER A FEW 10- AND 15-MINUTE TEACHING SESSIONS, HE BOUGHT HIS OWN EQUIPMENT AND PERFORMED A COUPLE TIMES A NIGHT SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK. HE STARTED TOURING IN 2012 AND ENJOYS STAYING ON THE ROAD. IT KEEPS HIM CLOSE TO NATURE, GIVES HIM A WAY TO SEE THE COUNTRY AND INTRODUCES HIM TO WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A STELLAR GROUP OF PEOPLE. "ABOVE ALL, I'M A BIKER," HE SAYS ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE. "I LOVE MY BIKER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND WHAT WE REPRESENT, WHICH IS GREAT CAUSES." IT INFLUENCES THE VENUES HE PICKS FOR PERFORMANCE, WHICH INCLUDE PLENTY OF BIKER RALLIES. "YOU BECOME FAMILY WITH A LOT OF [PEOPLE] AT THESE RALLIES," HE SAYS. "BIKERS ARE A CLOSE KNIT GROUP OF PEOPLE. A LOT GOES INTO THESE RALLIES [INCLUDING] A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE."

210	DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS (LETS CALL THEM RAOUL AND CHRISTINE, FOR CONVENIENCES SAKE) THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR VERY LONG TIME AND RECENTLY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP. IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT TO TEN YEARS AND I CONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP.  THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES.  DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST. ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN THOUGH RAOUL IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, I HAVE GOTTEN TO SEE A LOT OF HIS BAD SIDE (PLEASE TAKE FOLLOWING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, I DONT TRUST MYSELF TO NOT BE BIASED), INCLUDING HIS (SEEMING) UNWILLINGNESS TO BE AFFECTIONATE EVEN IN A RELATIONSHIP HE INITIATES. IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL IN ONE OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS.  THE FUNERAL IS 11 A.M. HOWEVER, THIS WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND RAOUL HAS SINCE ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?). I KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME; I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THAT. BUT I JUST CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.  ITS THEIR LIVES AND HAVE NO SAY IN IT, I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO IT IN PRACTICE.  IT ALSO HAS A BETA OF 0.44, SO ITS NOT GOING TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME AMOUNT OF VOLATILITY YOUR TYPICAL STOCK. ANOTHER PART WONDERS IF IM BEING UNFAIR TO RAOUL? MAYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR THEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE. IVE THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW IM NOT AS BOTHERED AS I WAS INITIALLY. UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH. I CANT FULLY COME TO TERMS WITH IT AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS BETTER THAN THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY I CANT JUST LIVE AND LET LIVE? WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO? SIGNED, ANXIOUS FOR NO GOOD REASON
211	THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPPED BY NEARLY THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS BETWEEN 2013 AND 2104, ACCORDING THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, FROM 13.3 TO 10.4 PERCENT. PUT ANOTHER WAY, 8.8 MILLION MORE PEOPLE WERE INSURED IN 2014 THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. THE ANNUAL STUDY FROM CENSUS IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE MEASURE OF HEALTH INSURANCE, ALTHOUGH A CHANGE IN THE WAY HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED MAKE THIS YEAR'S REPORT COMPARABLE TO 2013 BUT NOT EARLIER YEARS. CENSUS OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT A DIFFERENT ANNUAL SURVEY THAT HAS ASKED HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THIS TO BE THE BIGGEST DROP IN THE UNINSURED SINCE AT LEAST 2008. OTHERS SAY THE SIZABLE INCREASE IN AMERICANS WITH INSURANCE DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL HEALTH LAW IS UNPRECEDENTED SINCE THE CREATION OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID 50 YEARS AGO. "IT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DROP EVER," SAID PAUL FRONSTIN, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH RESEARCH AT THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WHO HAS BEEN STUDYING THE UNINSURED SINCE 1993. MORE IMPORTANTLY, SAID DIANE ROWLAND, HEAD OF THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION'S COMMISSION ON MEDICAID AND THE UNINSURED, "THE GAINS ARE EXACTLY WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WERE," MEANING THE LARGEST INCREASES IN COVERAGE WERE IN THOSE GROUPS WITH TRADITIONALLY THE HIGHEST RATES OF UNINSURANCE YOUNGER, WORKING-AGE ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH LOW AND MODERATE INCOMES. (KAISER HEALTH NEWS IS AN EDITORIALLY INDEPENDENT PROGRAM OF THE FOUNDATION.) DESPITE THE GAINS, THE CENSUS STUDY FOUND THAT 33 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT INSURANCE. WHILE THE GAINS IN INSURANCE COVERAGE WERE WIDESPREAD, THEY WEREN'T EQUAL IN EVERY CATEGORY. NOT SURPRISINGLY, AMONG TYPES OF COVERAGE, THE BIGGEST INCREASES WERE IN PEOPLE COVERED BY MEDICAID (UP 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 62 MILLION PEOPLE) AND PEOPLE BUYING THEIR OWN HEALTH PLANS (UP 3.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 14.6 MILLION PEOPLE). EXPANDING MEDICAID AND MAKING PRIVATE INSURANCE EASIER TO PURCHASE BY THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER COVERAGE WERE KEY FOCUSES OF THE HEALTH LAW. BUT THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REMAINS EMPLOYERS. THAT NUMBER HELD STEADY AT AROUND 55 PERCENT. THE UNINSURED RATE DROPPED FOR EVERY AGE, INCOME AND ETHNIC GROUP AND IN EVERY STATE, ALTHOUGH, AGAIN, SOME GAINED MORE THAN OTHERS. THOSE AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE WERE MORE LIKELY TO GAIN INSURANCE THAN THOSE WITH MORE RESOURCES. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN $25,000 PER YEAR DROPPED 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE RATE FOR THOSE WITH INCOMES BETWEEN $25,000 AND $50,000 DROPPED 5 POINTS. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR THOSE EARNING MORE THAN $100,000 ANNUALLY DROPPED TOO, BUT BY LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT. SIMILARLY, THE UNINSURED RATE FOR THE WHITE NON-HISPANIC POPULATION (THE ETHNICITY MOST LIKELY TO HAVE INSURANCE) DROPPED BY JUST OVER 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS, WHILE THE RATES FOR BLACKS, ASIAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS DROPPED BY MORE THAN 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS EACH. AMONG STATES, MASSACHUSETTS (WHICH BEGAN REQUIRING MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE INSURANCE IN 2006) HAD THE LOWEST RATE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT COVERAGE, AT 3.3 PERCENT, WHILE TEXAS CONTINUED TO LEAD THE NATION WITH THE HIGHEST UNINSURED RATE 19.1 PERCENT. STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, HOWEVER, SAW OVERALL GAINS IN INSURANCE NOT JUST MEDICAID THAT WERE LARGER THAN THOSE THAT DIDN'T. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE WITH INCOMES ABOVE POVERTY BUT LESS THAN FOUR TIMES THAT (MOST OF WHOM AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID) STILL SAW AN OVERALL DECLINE IN UNINSURANCE OF 6.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, WHILE STATES THAT DIDN'T TAKE THAT OPTION SAW THAT RATE DROP BY ONLY 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

213	THURSDAY AT 8 P.M. ET, VAN JONES WILL MODERATE A PANEL FEATURING THE VOICES OF NEW ORLEANS-BASED ORGANIZERS TALKING ABOUT THEIR LOCAL WORK FOR RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA. DEAR MOVEON MEMBER, IT'S BEEN 10 YEARS SINCE HURRICANE KATRINA CHANGED OUR COUNTRY. THE DISASTROUS FEDERAL RESPONSE TO THE STORM, THE LACK OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND SUPPORT FOR LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES, AND THE FAILURE OF OUR GOVERNMENT TO REBUILD ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE SHAPED OUR NATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO THE SUFFERING OF BLACK COMMUNITIES. OUR FRIENDS AT COLOROFCHANGE, THE COUNTRY'S LEADING ONLINE CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION THAT WAS FOUNDED IN THE STORM'S WAKE, ARE HOSTING AN IMPORTANT TOWN HALL TO REFLECT ON WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE HURRICANE KATRINA TORE THROUGH NEW ORLEANS AND SOUTHERN LOUISIANA. THIS THURSDAY AT 8 P.M. ET, AFTERMATH: THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK LIVES 10 YEARS AFTER KATRINAMODERATED BY CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND COLOROFCHANGE CO-FOUNDER VAN JONESWILL FEATURE THE VOICES OF NEW ORLEANS-BASED ORGANIZERS ON THEIR LOCAL WORK FOR RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR AFTERMATH: THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK LIVES 10 YEARS AFTER KATRINA. TEN YEARS AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA, BLACK WORKERS CONTINUE TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE ONGOING RECONSTRUCTION OF NEW ORLEANS, THOUGH MORE THAN $71 BILLION HAS BEEN SPENT TO RESTORE THE CITY. MORE THAN 50% OF THE CITY'S BLACK CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY, BLACK FAMILIES MAKE HALF THE INCOME OF WHITE FAMILIES, AND AS LITTLE AS 4% OF THE WORKFORCE ON CITY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IS BLACKEVEN WHILE 52% OF BLACK MEN IN NEW ORLEANS FACE UNEMPLOYMENT. COLOROFCHANGE IS JOINING NEW ORLEANS-BASED CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS TO DISCUSS ORGANIZING AND ACTIVISM IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA, RESISTANCE TO THE PRIVATIZATION OF SCHOOLS AND THE EXPANSION OF THE CRADLE-TO-PRISON PIPELINE, AND THE EXCLUSION OF BLACK WORKERS FROM QUALITY JOBS. THE ONLINE TOWN HALL WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT WITH FRONT-LINE ORGANIZERS IN THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK LIVES IN NEW ORLEANS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT STRUGGLES IN THE EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE THE ENTRENCHED PLANTATION ECONOMY, END WHITE SUPREMACY, AND BUILD A WORLD THAT RESPECTS BLACK LIVES IN SCHOOL, AT WORK, AND IN COMMUNITIES.

214	INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, WHICH MEASURES OUTPUT IN THE MANUFACTURING, UTILITIES AND MINING SECTORS, FELL A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED 0.4% IN AUGUST FROM JULY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE SAID TUESDAY. IT WAS THE SIXTH TIME IN EIGHT MONTHS THAT THE MEASURE FELL FROM THE PREVIOUS MONTH. CAPACITY UTILIZATION, WHICH MEASURES INDUSTRIAL SLACK, FELL TO 77.6% IN AUGUST FROM 78% IN JULY. ECONOMISTS SURVEYED BY THE WALL STREET JOURNAL HAD ANTICIPATED A PRODUCTION DROP OF 0.2% IN AUGUST AND CAPACITY UTILIZATION OF 77.8%. MEANWHILE, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FOR JULY WAS REVISED UP TO A 0.9% RISE FROM AN INITIAL ESTIMATE OF 0.6% GROWTH. MANUFACTURING OUTPUT, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR ALMOST THREE-QUARTERS OF OVERALL INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, FELL BY 0.5%, DRIVEN BY A 6.4% DROP IN PRODUCTION OF AUTOS AND AUTO PARTS AFTER AN INCREASE IN JULY OF MORE THAN 10%. "THAT DECLINE ONLY PARTIALLY REVERSED THE...JUMP IN MOTOR VEHICLE OUTPUT IN JULY, WHICH WE EXPLAINED AT THE TIME WAS DUE TO A SEASONAL DISTORTION CREATED BECAUSE FEWER PLANTS CLOSE DOWN FOR ANNUAL SUMMER RETOOLINGS NOW, " SAID PAUL ASHWORTH, AN ECONOMIST AT CAPITAL ECONOMICS, IN AN ANALYST NOTE. "THE 1.6% MONTHLY GAIN IN MACHINERY OUTPUT LAST MONTH WAS PRETTY ENCOURAGING AND MOTOR VEHICLE OUTPUT IS STILL UP SIGNIFICANTLY ON WHERE IT WAS IN JUNE. PRODUCTION OF NON-AUTO BUSINESS EQUIPMENT AND CONSUMER GOODS BOTH ROSE 0.4%, ALTHOUGH SOME ECONOMISTS WEREN'T IMPRESSED. "THE TRUE AUGUST STORY IS BURIED IN THE TALLIES WHICH EXCLUDE MOTOR VEHICLES AND PARTS; BOTH TOTAL PRODUCTION AND MANUFACTURING OUTPUT WERE DEAD FLAT IN AUGUST," WROTE IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT ECONOMIST MICHAEL MONTGOMERY IN A CLIENT NOTE. MANUFACTURING OUTPUT WAS UP 1.4% IN AUGUST FROM A YEAR EARLIER. OVERALL MINING OUTPUT FELL BY 0.6%, POTENTIALLY REFLECTING LOW ENERGY PRICES AND SLOWING COMMODITY DEMAND FROM CHINA. A RELATIVELY STRONG DOLLAR, WHICH MAKES EXPORTS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR OVERSEAS BUYERS, HAS ALSO CHECKED EXPANSION IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR. "WITHIN THE MINING SECTOR, OIL- AND GAS-WELL DRILLING EXPANDED 1.5% [ON A MONTHLY BASIS], BUT THIS WAS OFFSET BY SOFTNESS ELSEWHERE. ON NET, MANUFACTURING AND INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT IN THE U.S. REMAINS LACKLUSTER AND WE DO NOT EXPECT A SHARP TURNAROUND FOR THE SECTOR," SAID JESSE HURWITZ, AN ECONOMIST AT BARCLAYS, IN A NOTE TO CLIENTS. THE U.S. ECONOMY HAS BROADCAST MIXED SIGNALS ABOUT ITS HEALTH IN THE YEAR TO DATE. HIRING HAS BEEN STEADY, MANY HOUSING MARKETS HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENING, AND LOW GASOLINE PRICES HAVE PUT A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS IN AMERICAN CONSUMERS' WALLETS. BUT WAGE GROWTH AND CONSUMER SPENDING HAVE YET TO SHOW PROLONGED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT, AND THE ECONOMIC TURMOIL AROUND THE WORLD HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT WHERE OVERALL DEMAND FROM BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS IS HEADING.

215	BLOG FALL CHALLENGE REVIEW LETS START BY THROWING OUT A HUGE THANK YOU TO DAVE, CHRIS AND JESSE THE OWNERS OF THE WEST COAST TRIPLE CROWN FOR HOSTING ANOTHER FANTASTIC EVENT. AS ALWAYS IT WAS RIGHT ON SCHEDULE WITH NO LONG BREAKS AND THE PROGRAMMING WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND BATTLE TESTED. MY GUESS IS EVERY WORKOUT WENT EXACTLY HOW THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL THE VOLUNTEERS WHO GAVE UP THEIR TIME TO JUDGE AND HELP SETUP FOR THIS EVENT. I PERSONALLY DONT DO ENOUGH VOLUNTEERING AT LOCAL EVENTS AND I PLAN ON CHANGING THAT IN THE FUTURE AND I HOPE SOME OF YOU WILL AS WELL. EVENT LIKE THESE CANT GO OFF WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE COMMUNITY. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THEY DONT MAKE ENOUGH DOING THESE TO PAY EVERYONE. IT WAS SO AWESOME THAT SO MANY OF YOU LIONS FAITHFUL CAME UP TO SQUAMISH ON A HORRIBLE RAINY WEEKEND TO SUPPORT OUR ATHLETES. VANESSA (AKA MIKE TYSON), KARINA, ANNIE, SCOTT, KATHRYN,JEFF, PAULINE, MRS HARRISON, MY MOM, JOHN ON SATURDAY, CHRISTI ON SATURDAY, OWEN ON SUNDAY. IT REALLY MEANT A TON TO EVERYONE TO HAVE YOU GUYS CHEERING. PERSONALLY I HEARD EVERY CHEER WHILE ON THE FLOOR. SATURDAY THE INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION RECAP: TEAM LIONS FOR SATURDAY WAS GILL FOR THE LADIES AND THEN MYSELF, BRETT, OWEN, SHAYAN AND MIKE. GILL: FINISHED ON THE PODIUM FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WITH A 3RD PLACE OVERALL FINISH. HER WEEKEND WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A DOMINATING FIRST PLACE PERFORMANCE IN THE 5K RUN AND A 4TH PLACE FINISH IN THE CROSSFITTY CROSSFIT WOD. COACH CHRIS: FIRST INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION FOR ME IN THE LAST 5 YEARS (NOT INCLUDING THE OPEN). I FINISHED 7TH OVERALL. MY DAY WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A 3RD PLACE IN CROSSFITTY CROSSFIT WOD AND A 5TH PLACE IN THE 5K RUN. MIKE SWANSON: FIRST TIME COMPETING WITH A CROSSFIT LIONS SHIRT ON HIS BACK. MIKE FINISHED 16TH OVERALL. HIS DAY WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A 9TH PLACE FINISH IN THE KEG CARRY AND A 16TH PLACE FINISH ON THE 5K RUN. OWEN RAY: ALSO FIRST TIME COMPETING AS AN INDIVIDUAL AT A CROSSFIT EVENT. OWEN FINISHED 18TH OVERALL. HE CLAIMED A 4TH PLACE FINISH ON THE KEG CARRY AND A 12TH PLACE FINISH ON SANDBAG WORKOUT. COACH SHAYAN: FINISHED 24TH OVERALL. SHAYAN FINISHED 17TH IN THE MUSCLE UPS EVENT AND 19TH IN THE RUN. BRETT THORNBURN: BRETTS FIRST INDIVIDUAL COMPETIITION. HE FINISHED 19TH ON THE KEG CARRY AND 22ND ON THE RUN. ALL THE INDIVIDUAL ATHLETES DID THE GYM PROUD AND I THINK WE ALL LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE OUR FITNESS IS AT AND WHAT WE NEED TO WORK ON. TEAM COMPETITION ON SUNDAY: TEAMS WERE MADE UP OF 1 MALE AND 1 FEMALE. THE WORKOUTS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THE INDIVIDUAL EVENT HELD ON SATURDAY AND 4 OF US DID BOTH DAYS. HICKS AND HARRISON: GILL AND I FINISHED 4TH OUT OF THE 40 TEAMS COMPETING. IT INCLUDED A FIRST PLACE ON THE RUN EVENT AND A 3RD PLACE ON THE MUSCLE UPS. IT ALSO MUST BE SAID THAT IF I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO PUT TWO FEET ON THE FINISH MAT AFTER MY LAST KEG CARRY WE WOULD HAVE FINISHED THE WEEKEND IN 3RD PLACE. WOOPS. JAME AND ODLUND: COACH JOHN AND HIS LOVELY GIRLFRIEND CAMILA PARTNERED UP AND DID AWESOME WITH AN 11TH PLACE FINISH OVERALL. IT WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A 3RD PLACE FINISH IN THE KEG CARRY AND 11TH PLACE ON THE MUSCLE UPS. CROSS AND SWANSON: STEPH AND MIKE CAME IN IN 18TH PLACE OVERALL. THEIR BEST FINISH WAS A 4TH PLACE ON THE RUN AND 15TH ON THE MUSCLE UP. CHAMBERS AND VAGHAYENEGAR: SHAYAN AND CHRISTI FINISHED 23RD OVERALL. 6TH PLACE ON THE 7K RUN WAS THEIR BEST EVENT AND 15TH ON THE MUSCLE UPS. REALLY PROUD OF ALL OUR TEAMS FROM THIS PAST WEEKEND. IT WAS REALLY FUN HAVING SO MANY OF US IN SUCH A GREAT EVENT. I THINK ITS SAFE TO SAY WE ALL ENJOYED OURSELVES THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE DAY. A COUPLE HICKUPS ALL AROUND (INCLUDING SOME OUT OF OUR CONTROL) BUT OVERALL A VERY ENJOYABLE TIME NO DOUBT. THE CASCADE CLASSIC, THE LARGEST EVENT IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, IS NEXT UP FOR CROSSFIT LIONS. ITS ON THANKSGIVING WEEKEND AND SCOTT AND ANNIE HAVE BOTH QUALIFIED TO COMPETE. THERE WILL BE A CREW OF US HEADING DOWN FOR THE WEEKEND AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US LET ME KNOW. TONS OF TOP CROSSFIT GAMES ATHLETES WILL BE THROWING DOWN.
216	EACH DAY WE SEE THE EFFORT OF UNIONS TO FORCE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY FARM WORKERS TO PAY BRIBES TO WORK. THEN YOU HAVE THE EFFORT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES ARE FORCING WORKERS TO SPEND MORE ON WORKING CONDITIONS. THEN YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR FARMS, ESPECIALLY IF A NEW PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. THE SOLUTION IS ROBOTS AND MACHINES TO DO THE PICKING AND HARVESTING OF CROPS. WHILE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE NEW MACHINES, THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SO. YEARS AGO UC DAVIS DEVELOPED A TOMATO PICKING MACHINEBUT THE UNIONS STOPPED ITS DEVELOPMENT. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. AGAIN, AMERICA CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN AGRICULTURE INTERNATIONALLY. WE CAN INNOVATE AND FEED THE HUNGRY MASSES BY MAKING FOOD AVAILABILITY MORE RELIABLE AND LOW COST. 4 LABOR-INTENSIVE CROPS FARMERS WISH THEY HAD ROBOTS TO HARVEST ELIZA BARCLAY, KPBS, 9/7/15 THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION SAYS MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO PICK HOT AND BELL PEPPERS COULD HELP SOLVE LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEMS. IF YOURE ENJOYING A LATE-SUMMER FRUIT PIE THIS LABOR DAY, CONSIDER WHAT WENT INTO GROWING AND HARVESTING THAT FRUIT. CHANCES ARE, IT TOOK A LOT OF HUMAN HANDS TO ENSURE ITS SKIN WOULD BE PERFECT AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. WHILE MACHINES HAVE REPLACED HUMAN HANDS FOR A LOT OF FARM JOBS THE HARVESTING OF TOMATOES FOR PROCESSING, THE CUTTING OF LETTUCE AND SPINACH, THE SHAKING OF ALMOND TREES TO MAKE THE NUTS FALL TO THE GROUND MANY FRUIT, VEGETABLE AND NUT FARMERS STILL RELY HEAVILY ON PEOPLE TO PLANT, MAINTAIN AND HARVEST THEIR CROPS. MACHINES DONT YET EXIST FOR THESE CROPS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN AMPLE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK, AND BECAUSE ITS HARD TO DESIGN MACHINES THAT CAN CUT OR PICK THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLES WITHOUT SQUISHING OR DAMAGING THEM TOO MUCH. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. ALL THATS CREATED A NEW PUSH FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO MECHANIZATION TO REPLACE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME FILLING. THERES AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF FRESH-MARKET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS, MATTHEW WHITING , AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND EXTENSION SPECIALIST AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEET CHERRY INDUSTRY, TELLS THE SALT. THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED HARVEST LABOR IS ON EVERY GROWERS MIND. FOR LABOR DAY, WE THOUGHT WED ROUND UP SOME OF THE CROPS THAT CANT YET BE HARVESTED BY A MACHINE, BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE FUTURE. TO BE CLEAR, THE ISSUE OF FARM LABOR IS COMPLICATED. AND MACHINES THAT COULD HARVEST THESE CROPS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE. SWEET CHERRIES THESE ARE THE SOFT, SWEET CHERRIES WE GET IN BAGS WITH THE STEM ATTACHED. AND WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND PLUMP? BECAUSE A HUMAN HAND CAREFULLY PICKED THEM. BUT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER WILLING HANDS TO DO THAT WORK. AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTICED. OF ALL THE PRODUCERS THAT DREAM OF MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO EASE THEIR LABOR WOES, THE SWEET CHERRY GROWERS MIGHT BE THE CLOSEST TO GETTING ONE THANKS TO RESEARCH FUNDING. MATT WHITING SAYS HE AND OTHERS AT WSU ARE CLOSE TO FINDING A COMMERCIAL PARTNER FOR A PROTOTYPE HARVESTER THAT CAN PICK 50 TIMES AS MANY CHERRIES AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD IN THE SAME TIME. STILL, THERES ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS NEW MODEL IS VIABLE: NEW VARIETIES OF CHERRIES SUITED TO THE MECHANICAL HARVESTER WILL NEED TO BE BRED. WHITING SAYS RESEARCH IS HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT IN 10 TO 12 YEARS, SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER GROWERS A SUITE OF NEW VARIETIES. ASPARAGUS AS THE HUFFINGTON POST HAS REPORTED , ASPARAGUS IS UNIQUELY LABOR INTENSIVE BECAUSE THE QUICK-GROWING PLANT MUST BE HARVESTED EVERY DAY OF ITS THREE-MONTH GROWING SEASON. EACH PLANT SPROUTS MULTIPLE SPEARS (THE PART OF THE PLANT WE EAT) A DAY, WHICH HAVE TO BE HAND-CUT EVERY DAY. SO THAT MEANS WORKERS ARE CUTTING 14 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FROM ROUGHLY FEBRUARY TO MAY. BUT VARIOUS MECHANICAL ASPARAGUS HARVESTERS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING THEM. ACCORDING TO A 2009 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT , IF THE U.S. ASPARAGUS INDUSTRY IS TO INSURE A COMPETITIVE POSITION, IT MUST SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGY FOR LABOR TO LOWER PER UNIT COSTS AND SHIFT THE WORKFORCE TO VALUE-ADDED EMPLOYMENT. INSTITUTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW. APPLES COMMERCIAL APPLE PICKING TODAY REQUIRES BRAWN WORKERS HAVE TO FILL BUCKETS ALL DAY LONG WITH HEAVY APPLES AND THEN DUMP THEM INTO BINS. AND ACCORDING TO A FRUIT INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION , THE ERA OF FULLY AUTOMATED ROBOTIC HARVESTERS NAVIGATING [APPLE] ORCHARD ROWS IS STILL YEARS AWAY. WHITING SAYS THATS BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS DEDICATED LITTLE FUNDING DEDICATED TO RESEARCH. THATS CHANGING, THOUGH. THE WASHINGTON STATE TREE FRUIT RESEARCH COMMISSION IS NOW PURSUING MORE RESEARCH ON MECHANICAL HARVESTING. AND THIS YEAR, SOME COMMERCIAL APPLE FARMERS MAY BE USING A VACUUM HARVESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME. ITS DESIGNERS SAY IT SAVES TIME, REDUCES PICKER FATIGUE AND BOOST THE HARVEST YIELD. PEPPERS CALIFORNIA GROWS ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE PEPPERS IN THE U.S., AND LATELY THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION HAS BEEN TALKING MORE DEVELOPING MECHANICAL HARVESTING AND VARIETIES BRED TO BE PICKED BY MACHINES. ACCORDING TO A 2015 REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION, WITH INCREASING COST AND DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF LABOR NEEDED TO PICK PEPPERS, INNOVATION [SIMILAR TO THE PROCESSED TOMATO INDUSTRY] COULD GIVE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. FARMERS SIGNIFICANT RETURNS AND POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PEPPER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA, THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO HAVE FRESH MARKET QUALITY AND MECHANICAL HARVESTING IN BOTH BLOCKY [BELL PEPPERS] AND HOT TYPES.

217	BRIDPORT GIG ROWING CLUB PUT IN A STRONG PERFORMANCE AT SIDMOUTHS REGATTA TO FINISH IN SECOND PLACE OVERALL. THE DAY BEGAN WITH SOME RAIN, ALTHOUGH THE SEA CONDITIONS WERE GOOD. THE FIRST RACE WAS THE LADIES A EVENT, IN WHICH BRIDPORT FINISHED SECOND IN DAGGER, RACING OVER A KITE-SHAPED COURSE WITH TWO STROKE SIDE TURNS AND A SPRINT TO THE FINISH LINE. BRIDPORT ENTERED TWO LADIES B TEAMS, WHO CAME THIRD AND SEVENTH. AFTER THE LADIES RACES, THE RAIN STOPPED AND THE VISIBILITY IMPROVED OVER THE REST OF THE DAY. THE MENS A CREW HAD A VERY STRONG START TO THEIR RACE, COX JASON MATTHEWS PUSHED THE CREW ON THE FIRST LEG, BATTLING WITH BOATS NEXT TO THEM. THEY PULLED AWAY AROUND THE FIRST TURN AND COULD NOT BE CAUGHT, WINNING WITH A TIME OF 11 MINUTES AND 31 SECONDS THE FASTEST TIME OF THE DAY. THE MENS B CREW, WHICH COMPRISED OF SOME NEW AND EXPERIENCED ROWERS, SECURED FOURTH PLACE. BRIDPORT ALSO ENTERED TWO CREWS FOR THE LADIES VETS' EVENT. THE CREW ROWING IN DAGGER FINISHED SECOND WITH THE BLAEZ CREW FINISHING FIFTH. THE MENS VETS IN CAME THIRD AND SEVENTH AND BOTH MIXED TEAMS HAD BATTLES TO SECURE SECOND AND SEVENTH RESPECTIVELY. PROMOTED STORIES BY THE END OF THE RACING, BRIDPORT WERE SECOND OVERALL BEHIND WEYMOUTH, WITH LYME REGIS IN THIRD. THE OTHER CLUBS THAT COMPETED WERE EXMOUTH, LANGSTONE, TEIGNMOUTH AND THE HOST CLUB SIDMOUTH.

PHOTO - HTTP://PHOTOS.PRNEWSWIRE.COM/PRNH/20150917/267547 IT IS NOW NO LONGER MANDATORY TO DISCUSS WITH AN AGENT IN ORDER TO ANALYZE AUTO INSURANCE OPTIONS. CLIENTS CAN NOW DO THIS IN A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT WAY, SIMPLY BY VISITING A FULLY OPTIMIZED AND PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE THAT GATHERS VARIOUS QUOTES FROM TOP RANKING AGENCIES: HTTP://AUTOCARINSURANCECHEAP.COM/ . THE ADVANTAGES OF COMPARING ONLINE AUTO INSURANCE QUOTES IF DRIVERS CALL A BROKER TO ASK FOR CAR INSURANCE OPTIONS, THEY MAY BE OFFERED SEVERAL PLANS, BUT THERE ARE HIGH CHANCES THAT ALL THE PLANS COME FROM THE SAME PROVIDER.

BY COMPARING ONLINE CAR INSURANCE QUOTES, DRIVERS CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE QUOTES THEY GET ARE SELECTED FROM MORE THAN ONE PROVIDER. THIS ENABLES EACH CAR OWNER TO LOOK AT POLICIES FROM VARIOUS COMPETITORS AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS, FINDING CHEAPER COVERAGE IS A LOT EASIER. GETTING CAR INSURANCE QUOTES IS ALSO EASIER, AS CLIENTS DO NOT HAVE TO CALL VARIOUS AGENCIES. COMPLETING A SINGLE SHORT ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE IS ALL IT TAKES FOR DRIVERS TO FIND AUTO INSURANCE PLANS IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. ALL THE QUOTES ARE DISPLAYED ON A SINGLE WEB PAGE, MAKING THE PROCESS SIMPLE AND CONVENIENT. ALTHOUGH AUTO INSURANCE QUOTES OFFER A HIGH DEGREE OF SPEED AND CONVENIENCE, DISCUSSING INSURANCE OPTIONS WITH A LIVE AGENT MAY STILL BE IMPORTANT. CLIENTS CAN TALK WITH PROFESSIONAL BROKERS FOR FREE BY CALLING 1-888-998-2049. "COMPARING CAR INSURANCE QUOTES IS CONVENIENT AND FAST. BUT SOMETIMES A PROFESSIONAL BROKER CANNOT BE REPLACED.

221	HUNGARY HAS DETAINED 60 MIGRANTS FOR ILLEGALLY CROSSING THE SERBIAN BORDER FENCE AS IT IMPOSED TOUGH NEW RULES TO SECURE ITS SOUTHERN FRONTIER AND STOP THE FLOW OF REFUGEES. AUTHORITIES ERECTED A RAZOR-WIRE FENCE OVERNIGHT AT A RAILWAY TRACK USED BY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES TO CROSS INTO HUNGARY FROM NEIGHBOURING SERBIA, A NON-EU NATION. HUNGARY ALSO DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN TWO SOUTHERN COUNTIES NEAR THE BORDER BECAUSE OF THE MIGRATION CRISIS. THE HUNGARIAN ARMY HAS ALREADY BEEN DEPLOYED IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY? BUT REINFORCEMENTS MAY BE SENT TO THE CRISIS AREAS. ON TUESDAY, POLICE DETAINED THE 60 MIGRANTS FOR BREACHING THE RAZOR-WIRE FENCE, THE GOVERNMENT SAID. THE SPOTS WHERE THE FENCE WAS DAMAGED WERE BEING REPAIRED. POLICE ALSO SAID 9,380 MIGRANTS WERE CAUGHT CROSSING FROM SERBIA ON MONDAY, THE HIGHEST DAILY FIGURE THIS YEAR. THE GOVERNMENT HAS VOWED TO BUILD A 3.5M-HIGH FENCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE 108 MILES OF HUNGARYS SOUTHERN BORDER BY OCTOBER. NEW BORDER LAWS AND POWERS TO EXPEL ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO CROSS FROM SERBIA WERE ENACTED AT MIDNIGHT LOCAL TIME, PROMPTING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TO CAMP OUT AT THE BORDER, AS AID WORKERS BROUGHT TENTS, FOOD AND WATER. SKYS ALEX ROSSI, ON THE SERBIAN SIDE OF THE BORDER, MET A FAMILY WHO SAID THEIR BABY WAS BORN FOUR DAYS AGO IN GREECE AS THEY MADE THE JOURNEY FROM SYRIA TO EUROPE. THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR ITS TREATMENT OF THE REFUGEES. BUT OFFICIALS ARE ADAMANT THE COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT ITSELF, WHILE ALSO CLAIMING IT IS ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF EUROPES BORDERS. THE UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE AGENCY, THE UNHCR, SAID IT DISPUTES HUNGARYS DESIGNATION OF SERBIAAS A SAFE THIRD COUNTRY, AND ADVISED MIGRANTS AGAINST RETURNING TO SERBIA. MORE THAN 190,000 REFUGEES HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS ENTERING HUNGARY THIS YEAR, MANY OF THEM FLEEING CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA. MOST OF THE REFUGEES ARE TRYING TO REACH THE RICHER COUNTRIES OF NORTHERN AND WESTERN EUROPE, PARTICULARLY GERMANY. HUNGARY SAYS REFUGEES ARE STILL ABLE TO CLAIM ASYLUM AT OFFICIAL BORDER CROSSINGS, BUT IF THEY HAVE ENTERED FROM SERBIA THEY FACE AUTOMATIC EXPULSION WITHIN EIGHT DAYS. ANY REFUGEE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE COUNTRY UNOFFICIALLY FACES A 12 MONTH TO THREE-YEAR PRISON TERM. AT THE OFFICIAL BORDER CROSSING, AROUND A MILE FROM THE NOW-CLOSED UNOFFICIAL CROSSING POINT, THE HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES LAUNCHED AN UNEXPECTED MASS TRANSIT OPERATION. REFUGEES STILL INSIDE SERBIA WERE ALLOWED TO FORM THEMSELVES INTO LINES AND ENTER THE CUSTOMS AREA, TO BE LOADED ONTO BUSES. THEY WERE THEN DRIVEN A SHORT DISTANCE TO TRAINS WAITING TO TAKE THEM TO AUSTRIA. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES HAVE MADE THE JOURNEY TO EUROPE THIS YEAR, THE VAST MAJORITY HEADING TO GERMANY, AS THEY FLEE CONFLICT AND POVERTY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. IN BRUSSELS, MINISTERS FROM THE 28-NATION BLOC HAVE AGREED TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 40,000 PEOPLE SEEKING REFUGE IN OVERWHELMED ITALY AND GREECE. THE LEADERS ARE HOPEFUL OF REACHING EVENTUAL AGREEMENT ON WHICH EUROPEAN NATIONS WOULD TAKE 120,000 MORE. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WANTS 22 EU MEMBER STATES TO SIGN UP TO A QUOTA POLICY BUT SEVERAL NATIONS OPPOSE SUCH A MOVE, INCLUDING POLAND, SLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY. MINISTERS WILL MEET AGAIN NEXT MONTH TO WORK OUT HOW MANY REFUGEES EACH NATION WILL TAKE IN. BUT THE FAILURE TO REACH A CONSENSUS ON THE 120,000 HAS DRAWN CRITICISM, INCLUDING FROM SOME AID AGENCIES. THE GERMAN VICE CHANCELLOR SIGMAR GABRIEL SAID EUROPE MADE A FOOL OF ITSELF AGAIN YESTERDAY. MR GABRIEL RAISED THEPROJECTION ON THE NUMBER OF NEWCOMERS GERMANY EXPECTS TO SHELTER THIS YEAR FROM 800,000 TO 1 MILLION. VIDEO FOR SKY NEWS, 2015, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
222	MISTAKES ARE A NORMAL PHENOMENON IN LIFE. ALL HAVE, AT ONE TIME OR THE OTHER, COMMITTED A MISTAKE. SOME ARE DUE TO IGNORANCE, WHILE OTHERS ARE DUE TO SHEER FOOLHARDINESS. GENERALLY, WE TEND TO LEARN LESSONS FROM OUR MISTAKES, WHICH IN TURN HELP TO IMPROVE UPON OUR SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS IN LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR. WHILE SOME CONTINUALLY MAKE MISTAKES AND GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE LEARNING FROM THEM, LIFE DOES NOT AFFORD OTHERS THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY. A SINGLE MISTAKE FROM SUCH PERSONS IS ENOUGH TO LEAD TO YEARS OF SUFFERING. SOMETIMES A SINGLE MISTAKE IS ENOUGH TO LEAD THEM TO ETERNAL DAMNATION. THERE IS THIS TRAGIC STORY THAT I NEVER CEASE TO TELL MY STUDENTS. IT WAS ABOUT A BLOKE CALLED ELVIS. HE CAME FROM A POOR FAMILY BUT WAS SUCH A BRILLIANT, RESPECTFUL AND HARDWORKING STUDENT. HIS AMBITION WAS TO BECOME EITHER A DOCTOR OR AN ENGINEER. HE HAD HIS BASIC EDUCATION IN ONE OF THE REMOTEST PARTS OF THE VOLTA REGION BUT MANAGED TO MAKE SIX ONES. HIS AMBITION SEEMED TO BE ON COURSE WHEN HE GAINED ADMISSION INTO ONE OF THE BEST SCIENCE SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY. HE WON MANY ACADEMIC AWARDS IN THE SCHOOL DUE TO HIS DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK. IT WAS WHILE HE WAS AWAITING HIS SECONDARY SCHOOL RESULTS THAT A SINGLE MISTAKE LED TO HIS TRAGIC END. HE HAD A COUSIN WHO WAS A BICYCLE REPAIRER. BEING A VERY HARDWORKING BLOKE, HE DECIDED TO USE HIS HOLIDAYS TO LEARN BICYCLE REPAIRS FROM THE COUSIN. THE COUSIN WAS HOWEVER A BELIEVER IN THE EFFICACY OF THE GANJA HERB, POPULARLY KNOWN AS INDIAN HEMP. ONE DAY IN HIS BID TO CONVINCE THE COUSIN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO GAIN FROM GANJA , HE FOOLISHLY ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE TO SMOKE A ROLL OF THE HERB TO DISPROVE THE BELIEF THAT IT WAS EFFICACIOUS. AND THAT WAS HIS DOOM! SOON AFTER HE FINISHED SMOKING, HIS MIND STARTED PLAYING GAMES WITH HIM AND HE STARTED ACTING IN A FUNNY WAY. THAT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE, CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT HE HAD HITHERTO NOT EVEN SMOKED A CIGARETTE. IN THAT SCHIZOPHRENIC STATE, HE RUSHED HOME. HE MISTOOK A BOTTLE OF ACID GIVEN TO HIM FOR SAFEKEEPING FOR A MINERAL AND GULPED THE CONTENT. THE RESULT WAS A HUGE TRAGEDY. THE CORROSIVE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE DID NOT GIVE HIM ANY CHANCE OF SURVIVAL. HE JOINED HIS ANCESTORS IN SAMANFOLAND BEFORE THEY COULD REACH A MEDICAL FACILITY. BUT THAT WAS AFTER HE HAD HAD TO ENDURE SEVERE PAIN AND SUFFERING. MY POINT IS THAT A SINGLE MISTAKE COULD LEAD TO A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT MAY LEAD TO ONES DOOM. AS THE HEADING MAY HAVE HINTED, MY FOCUS IS ON THOSE RIDING ON THE GREAT ELEPHANT. BEING A HUMAN INSTITUTION, THE OSONO MAY HAVE MADE SOME MISTAKES IN THE PAST AND LEARNT LESSONS FROM THEM. BUT TRUST ME; ITS LATEST MISTAKE IS A VERY GRAVE ONE AND COULD GRADUALLY LEAD TO ITS UNDOING. THE CHOICE OF PAUL AFOKO AND KWABENA AGYAPONG AS CHAIRMAN AND GENERAL SECRETARY RESPECTIVELY IS WHAT I REFER TO. I DID SUPPORT KWABENAS BID DURING THE PARTY CONTEST, BUT HINDSIGHT HAS MADE ME WISER. AS FOR AFOKO, I SUSPECTED HE WOULD BE A DISASTER SO I THREW MY WEIGHT BEHIND A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE. AS WE ALL KNOW, AFOKO DID WIN THE CONTEST; AND IM SAD TO SAY HE HAS SO FAR PROVED ME RIGHT. MY RELIGIOUS UPBRINGING DOES NOT PERMIT ME TO ACCUSE OTHERS OF ILL-MOTIVE WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE, SO I WOULD NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THE AGENDA 2020 OPERATION THE DUO IS BEING ACCUSED OF. BUT THEIR ACTIONS SINCE ASSUMING OFFICE HAVE LEFT NO DOUBT IN MANY MINDS THAT THEIR SELECTION WAS A GRAVE MISTAKE. THE BELLIGERENT ATTITUDE OF THE DUO TOWARDS THE OTHER PARTY OFFICIALS HAS CONTINUALLY HEIGHTENED TENSIONS AMONG THE RANK AND FILE. SOME UNILATERAL ACTIONS OF THEIRS WHICH READILY COME TO MIND ARE THE ABORTIVE DISMISSAL OF MARTIN ADJEI KORSAH AND THE CHANGING OF SECURITY GUARDS AT THE PARTYS HEADQUARTERS, WHICH LED TO ARMED ALTERCATIONS AMONG PARTY FOLKS IN FULL GLARE OF THE MEDIA. THE HEIGHTENED TENSIONS THAT LED TO THE UNFORTUNATE ACID-POURING SAGA WERE AVOIDABLE. THE I-AM-EATING-FUFU EPISODE BY KWABENA HAS DONE THE PARTY MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THE RECENT ORCHESTRATION TO TARNISH THE IMAGE OF SOME PARTY OFFICIALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING INTERNAL CORRUPTION HAS ALSO GIVEN RISE TO MANY QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. WHY IS THE DUO SILENT ON THE ALLEGATION OF A SECRET ECOBANK ACCOUNT, WHEN THEY KNOW TOO WELL THAT THE ACCOUNT HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR CLOSE TO SEVEN YEARS? WHY DID THEY REFUSE TO SIGN THE ECOBANK SIGNATURE FORM, ONLY TO TURNAROUND TO ISSUE PRESS STATEMENTS PURPORTING TO FIGHT CORRUPTION? AND WHAT WAS THE REAL MOTIVE FOR THE PRESS RELEASE? FOR SURE, THE SECRET ACCOUNT ALLEGATION AND THE ILL-TIMED PRESS STATEMENT HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR PURPOSE. THEY HAVE INDEED TAKEN THE SHINE OFF NANA ADDOS ARISE AND BUILD TOUR AND BROUGHT NEGATIVE STORIES ABOUT THE PARTY BACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT. DID I HEAR YOU SAY SABOTAGE? I DONT KNOW WHAT NANA ADDO IS THINKING. BUT IF I WERE HIM, I WOULD BE THINKING OF HOW TO CORRECT THE GRAVE MISTAKE THE PARTY MADE IN TAMALE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM, THIS IS ONE OF THE RARE MISTAKES THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO RECTIFY. HMM, COULD THIS BE THE MISTAKE TO LEAD THE PARTY TO ETERNAL DAMNATION? MASSA, WITH SUCH HIGH LEVELS OF INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION BEING DISPLAYED BY THE SO-CALLED RESURRECTED GOAT AND HIS CRONIES, I SHUDDER TO IMAGINE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF MISRULE UNDER SUCH CONFUSED GOATS. SEE YOU NEXT WEEK FOR ANOTHER KONKONSA , DEO VOLENTE ! BY AGYA KWAKU OGBORO COMMENTS COMMENTS
223	REVISED: FROM A NOTORIOUS CON MAN TO CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES, THIS GRAND HOME -- NAY, THIS GRAND COMPOUND -- IN THE HEART OF THE LOS FELIZ NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES HAS HOUSED QUITE A CAST OF CHARACTERST OVER THE YEARS. WITH 14 BEDROOMS AND EIGHT BATHROOMS, IT'S RICH WITH HISTORY AND BRIMMING WITH POSSIBILITIES. BUILT IN 1929 BY ARCHITECT HARLEY S.  HE SAID ZAMBIA'S STABLE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, ECONOMIC FISCAL REGIME AND POLICIES OFFERED GREAT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. BRADLEY FOR A MAN NAMED RUDOLPH ROSENBERG , IT WAS SOLD THE SAME YEAR TO MUSIC STORE MAGNATE BEN PLATT . OVER THE YEARS, PLATT HIRED ARCHITECTS PAUL R. WILLIAMS AND ALBERT E. HANSEN , TO EXPAND IT, ADDING A POOL, TENNIS COURTS, AND ANOTHER STORY TO BRING IT TO ITS CURRENT 10,000-SQUARE-FOOT MEASUREMENT. THE NEXT OWNER WAS A NOTORIOUS CON MAN NAMED C.C. JULIAN , WHOM LISTING AGENT DAVID SOLOMON DESCRIBES AS THE BERNIE MADOFF OF HIS DAY. AFTER HIS COMPANY, THE JULIAN PETROLEUM CORP., WAS FOUND TO HAVE SWINDLED MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE OUT OF $150 MILLION, JULIAN COMMITTED SUICIDE (NOT IN THIS HOME) IN 1934. IN THE LATE 1950S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OWNER TOOK OVER: THE SAINT COLUMBAN'S FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY, A GROUP OF CATHOLIC MISSIONARY PRIESTS WHO STILL LIVE THERE TODAY. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES MADE TO THE HOME OVER THE YEARS (SPACES WERE DIVIDED TO CREATE ADDITIONAL ROOMS TO HOUSE PRIESTS), SOLOMON SAYS THE HOME RETAINS MANY OF ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES, INCLUDING CARVED FIREPLACES AND DETAILED WOODWORK. THE MOST NOTEWORTHY HISTORIC FEATURE IS A CAVE THAT LEADS TO A HIDDEN WINE CELLAR TO A FULL SPEAK-EASY USED DURING PROHIBITION. THERE ARE ALSO QUARTERS FOR LIVE-IN STAFF. SOLOMON SAYS IT WILL TAKE THE RIGHT BUYER TO BRING THE HOME TO PRESENT-DAY STANDARDS, BUT THE RETURN COULD BE HUGE. CURRENTLY LISTED FOR $5,499,000, THE PROPERTY COULD BE VALUED AT OVER $12 MILLION POSTRENOVATION BASED ON ITS SIZE, HISTORY, AND LOCATION. "WHEN IT'S REDONE, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES IN LOS ANGELES," HE SAYS. ALTHOUGH THE HOME IS SET BACK FROM THE ROAD, IT FEATURES AMAZING CITY VIEWS AND IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HOLLYWOOD'S GREEK THEATRE AND GRIFFITH PARK. AS FOR THE NEIGHBORS, THINK HOLLYWOOD STARS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOME BEHIND THIS PROPERTY USED TO BE ROBERT PATTINSON 'S LOVE NEST WITH THEN-GIRLFRIEND KRISTEN STEWART . TJHE "TWILIGHT" STAR SOLD THE HOME IN 2014, AND NOW JIM PARSONS OF "THE BIG BANG THEORY" LIVES THERE.  SOLOMON SAYS WHILE IT COULD BE ANYONE FROM A SINGLE FAMILY TO A PRODUCTION COMPANY, THE LUCKY OWNER WILL DEFINITELY POSSESS ONE QUALITY.  WHITING SAYS THATS BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS DEDICATED LITTLE FUNDING DEDICATED TO RESEARCH. "THE RIGHT BUYER WILL BE SOMEONE WHO HAS AN APPRECIATION FOR THE TYPE OF HOME THEY JUST DON'T BUILD ANYMORE," HE SAID. "THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS."
224	MORE THAN HALF OF REPUBLICANS THINK OBAMA IS A MUSLIM, ACCORDING TO NEW POLL HTTP://T.CO/ZGCKINHSNA PIC.TWITTER.COM/GLKBCXMFWK MASHABLE (@MASHABLE) SEPTEMBER 1, 2015 DURING A VISIT TO HIS FATHERS NATIVE NAIROBI, KENYA THIS SUMMER, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA THUMBED HIS NOSE AT THE SO-CALLED BIRTHER MOVEMENT: PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE HE WAS NOT BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. I SUSPECT THAT SOME OF MY CRITICS BACK HOME ARE SUSPECTING THAT IM BACK HERE TO LOOK FOR MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE, HE JOKED WHILE DELIVERING A TOAST AT A STATE DINNER HOSTED BY KENYAN PRESIDENT UHURU KENYATTA . THAT IS NOT THE CASE. BUT A NEW POLL RELEASED TUESDAY CONDUCTED BY PUBLIC POLICY POLLING SHOWS THAT A LARGE SWATH OF REPUBLICANS WHO ARE REGULAR PRIMARY VOTERS ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS INDEED MUSLIM AND WAS BORN OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER DONALD TRUMPS XENOPHOBIC RHETORIC, MOST NOTABLY AGAINST MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS, IS PLAYING WELL AMONG HIS PARTYS VOTERS, WHO ALSO BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS SHOULD BE DEPORTED, THE RESULTS SHOW. DONALD TRUMPS SAYING THINGS OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK, BUT THAT HAVE GENERALLY BEEN SEEN AS NOT APPROPRIATE TO TALK ABOUT IN PUBLIC, DEAN DEBNAM , PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY POLLING SAID IN A STATEMENT (PDF). SO ITS NOT SURPRISING THAT PEOPLE WHO HOLD THOSE KINDS OF BELIEFS ARE GRAVITATING TOWARDS HIM. VIA POLL RESULTS FROM PUBLIC POLICY POLLING : 66% OF TRUMPS SUPPORTERS BELIEVE THAT OBAMA IS A MUSLIM TO JUST 12% THAT GRANT HES A CHRISTIAN. 61% THINK OBAMA WAS NOT BORN IN THE UNITED STATES TO ONLY 21% WHO ACCEPT THAT HE WAS. AND 63% WANT TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION TO ELIMINATE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP, TO ONLY 20% WHO WANT TO KEEP THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE. TRUMPS BELIEFS REPRESENT THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE GOP ELECTORATE. 51% OVERALL WANT TO ELIMINATE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP. 54% THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A MUSLIM. AND ONLY 29% GRANT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. THATS LESS THAN THE 40% WHO THINK CANADIAN BORN [TEXAS SEN.] TED CRUZ [A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE] WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES TRUMP, THE REAL ESTATE MOGUL AND REALITY TELEVISION STAR, IS AN EARLY PROPONENT OF THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT, WHICH STARTED IN 2008 WHEN THEN-ILLINOIS SENATOROBAMA MADE HIS FIRST RUN FOR PRESIDENT. WHILE RUNNING FOR HIS SECOND TERM, PRESIDENT OBAMA RELEASED HIS LONG-FORM BIRTH CERTIFICATE IN APRIL 2011, AFTER TRUMP PROPELLED SPECULATION THAT HE WAS BORN OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. BUT THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE STILL HAS NOT CONVINCED TRUMP THAT THE PRESIDENT IS A NATIVE-BORN U.S. CITIZEN, HE SAID IN JULY DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH CNNS ANDERSON COOPER . I DONT KNOW, TRUMP TOLD CNN WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE THOUGHT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE U.S. I REALLY DONT KNOW. I DONT KNOW WHY HE WOULDNT RELEASE HIS RECORDS. THE POLL RESULTS SHOW THAT TRUMPS SUPPORTERS ARENT THE ONLY ONESWHO HOLD THESE VIEWS: ONLY AMONG SUPPORTERS OF [OHIO GOV.] JOHN KASICH (58/13), [EX-FLORIDA GOV.] JEB BUSH (56/18), [NEW JERSEY GOV.] CHRIS CHRISTIE (59/33), AND [FLORIDA SEN.] MARCO RUBIO (42/30) ARE THERE MORE PEOPLE WHO THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES THAN THAT HE WASNT. BUSH, WHO WAS THE APPARENT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER BEFORE THE SUMMER OF TRUMP , HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RISE IN POPULARITY BECAUSE OF AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT PRIMARY VOTERS WHO HOLD THE SAME BELIEFS AS THOSE WHO FAVOR TRUMP, THE POLL SHOWS.

MY PLAN SETS FIVE GOALS: EMPOWER COMMUNITIES TO PREVENT DRUG USE AMONG TEENAGERS; ENSURE EVERY PERSON SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION CAN OBTAIN COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT; ENSURE THAT ALL FIRST RESPONDERS CARRY NALOXONE, WHICH CAN STOP OVERDOSES FROM BECOMING FATAL; REQUIRE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO RECEIVE TRAINING IN RECOGNIZING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND TO CONSULT A PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM BEFORE PRESCRIBING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES; AND PRIORITIZE TREATMENT OVER PRISON FOR LOW-LEVEL AND NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENDERS, SO WE CAN END THE ERA OF MASS INCARCERATION. ACHIEVING THESE GOALS WONT BE EASY. IT WILL TAKE COMMITMENT FROM ALL CORNERS LAW ENFORCEMENT, DOCTORS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENT AT EVERY LEVEL. THATS WHY MY PLAN STARTS BY PARTNERING WITH STATES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS AMERICA TO MEET THESE GOALS AND SUBSTANTIALLY EXPAND ACCESS TO TREATMENT. WELL ASK STATES TO DESIGN AMBITIOUS PLANS USING THE PROGRAMS THAT MAKE MOST SENSE FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES NEEDS. IN RETURN FOR STRONG PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE CRISIS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL DRAW ON A NEW $7.5 BILLION FUND TO HELP STATES MEET THEIR GOALS.

225	NINETEEN COMMONWEALTH BANK CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCEPTED COMPENSATION FROM A BANK SCHEME FOR VICTIMS OF BAD FINANCIAL ADVICE SINCE ITS LAUNCH LAST YEAR, NEW FIGURES SHOW. AN UPDATE ON THURSDAY SAID CBA'S OPEN ADVICE REVIEW, WHICH WAS CLOSED TO NEW APPLICANTS IN JULY, HAD PROMPTED 8835 CUSTOMERS TO REGISTER FOR A FREE FILE REVIEW INTO WHETHER THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION. HOWEVER, IN A SIGN OF THE PAINSTAKING REVIEW PROCESS, A MINORITY OF FILES HAVE BEEN ASSESSED SO FAR, AND THE NUMBER OF SETTLED CASES IS EVEN LOWER. THE REPORT, BY EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS PROMONTORY FINANCIAL GROUP, SAID THAT AT THE END OF AUGUST, 686 CASES HAD BEEN ASSESSED BY THE BANK. OF THIS GROUP, THE BANK HAD OFFERED COMPENSATION IN 53 CASES, OR 8 PER CENT OF ALL CASES ASSESSED. THE COMPENSATION SO FAR OFFERED BY THE BANK IS WORTH $950,252 IN TOTAL. AMONG THE 53 CUSTOMERS OFFERED A PAYOUT, 19 PEOPLE HAD ACCEPTED THE COMPENSATION, 11 HAD REJECTED THE OFFER AND 23 WERE STILL REVIEWING THE BANK'S PROPOSAL. THE BANK HAS PAID OUT $488,815 IN COMPENSATION UNDER THE SCHEME, UP FROM $79,702 AT THE END OF APRIL. CBA LAST YEAR OPENED UP THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM. IT ALLOWS ANY CUSTOMER OF COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL PLANNING AND FINANCIAL WISDOM BETWEEN 2003 AND 2012 TO HAVE THEIR FILES REVIEWED. IT FOLLOWED A DAMNING SENATE INQUIRY THAT FOUND THE BANK HAD UNDERPAID VICTIMS OF A SCANDAL, SOUGHT TO AVOID SCRUTINY, AND COVERED UP THE MISCONDUCT. "THE PROGRAM'S PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE CUSTOMERS WHO RECEIVED POOR ADVICE ARE PUT BACK IN THE POSITION THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY RECEIVED APPROPRIATE ADVICE, AND TO GIVE REASSURANCE TO OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT THE ADVICE THEY RECEIVED WAS APPROPRIATE," CBA SAID. IN APRIL, CBA CHIEF EXECUTIVE IAN NAREV SAID THE "PAINSTAKING" INVESTIGATION INTO PAST FILES WOULD TAKE UP TO MOST OF 2016. CBA SAID IT HAD INCREASED THE NUMBER OF STAFF WORKING ON THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM BY 100 SINCE MAY TO 613, ALLOWING IT TO SORT THROUGH MORE CUSTOMER FILES. WHILE IT CATALOGUED MORE THAN 900,000 CUSTOMER FILES IN THE FOUR MONTHS TO AUGUST, IT SAID THAT RETRIEVING FILES FOR FINANCIAL WISDOM CUSTOMERS WAS A "CHALLENGE" AND IT WAS STILL RELYING ON HARD COPY FILES IN SOME CASES. SEPARATELY FROM THIS COMPENSATION SCHEME, CBA HAD PAID OUT ABOUT $52 MILLION TO 1100 CUSTOMERS OF SPECIFIC ADVISERS WHO WERE IDENTIFIED FOR HAVING PROVIDED SHODDY ADVICE, MAINLY BETWEEN 2008 AND 2

227	THE COMPANY'S NEW PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HELP CHINESE COMPANIES WORKING IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS INDUSTRY AS IF CHINESE FACTORIES WEREN'T ALREADY PRODUCING ENOUGH OF OUR GADGETS, CHIP DESIGNER ARM HOLDINGS WANTS TO HELP CHINESE STARTUPS PRODUCE MORE WEARABLE DEVICES, ROBOTS AND SMART HOME PRODUCTS. TO THAT END, THE U.K. COMPANY IS SETTING UP AN "ACCELERATOR" IN BEIJING STAFFED WITH EXPERTS WHO CAN PROVIDE CHINESE COMPANIES WITH TIPS ON PRODUCT DESIGN INCLUDING WHICH CHIPS OR SOFTWARE TO USE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME ARM HAS CREATED SUCH A PROGRAM, AND ITS AIM IS TO REMOVE ANY BARRIERS THAT MIGHT HINDER CHINESE STARTUPS FROM QUICKLY DELIVERING THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COUNTRY IS ALREADY HOME TO NUMEROUS COMPANIES, LARGE AND SMALL, DEVELOPING SMARTPHONES, WEARABLES AND OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES. HOWEVER, LOCAL STARTUPS TYPICALLY POSSESS FEW RESOURCES, AND NOT ENOUGH KNOW-HOW TO QUICKLY DELIVER THEIR PRODUCTS, ACCORDING TO ARM. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE INCLUDE SELECTING THE RIGHT COMPONENTS, OPTIMIZING THE DEVICE'S SOFTWARE, OR FINDING OUT WHICH OPERATING SYSTEM BEST FITS THEIR NEEDS. ARM'S ACCELERATOR PROGRAM WANTS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES BY PROVIDING WORKSHOPS, TRAINING AND DESIGN SERVICES RELATING TO THE COMPANY'S OWN CHIP DESIGNS. THE U.K. COMPANY IS BEST KNOWN FOR SUPPLYING THE PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY USED IN MOST SMARTPHONE AND TABLETS. BUT ARM ALSO WANTS TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS INTO IOT AREAS SUCH AS SMART CITIES, SMART HOMES AND HEALTHCARE, WHERE ITS LOW-POWER CONSUMING PROCESSORS COULD FLOURISH. LAST YEAR, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS MBED PLATFORMTO HELP VENDORS BUILD IOT SYSTEMS. SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT ARM'S ACCELERATOR IN CHINA WILL ALSO BE OFFERING DESIGN SERVICES AROUND MBED. BUT ON MONDAY IN BEIJING, ARM'S CEO SIMON SEGARS SAID THAT THE ACCELERATOR WILL ALSO OPEN ITSELF TO OTHER IOT PLATFORMS FROM OTHER COMPANIES. THE GOAL IS TO ESSENTIALLY CONNECT CHINESE STARTUPS WITH THE APPROPRIATE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS, MANY OF WHOM ARE ALREADY PARTNERS WITH ARM, HE ADDED. THE ACCELERATOR WILL WORK THROUGH A COMPANY ARM HAS ESTABLISHED WITH BEIJING-BASEDTHUNDERSOFT, WHICH ALREADYSPECIALIZES IN HELPING SMARTPHONE AND TABLET VENDORS REFINE THE SOFTWARE ON THEIR DEVICES.THE ACCELERATOR'S FIRST OFFICE WILL BE BASED IN BEIJING, BUT TO REACH MORE STARTUPS, FOUR OR FIVE OTHER OFFICES WILL BE SET UP ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO. ALL CHINESE COMPANIES ARE INVITED TO JOIN. THE NEW PROGRAM WILL SURELY HELP PROMOTE ARM'S CHIP DESIGNS AND SOFTWARE, BUT IT COULD ALSO ASSIST CHINESE VENDORS IN CREATING SUCCESSFUL IOT PRODUCTS,SAID KITTY FOK, AN ANALYST WITH RESEARCH FIRM IDC. IN THE FUTURE, ARM COULD EVEN ADVISE THESE CHINESE STARTUPS ON WHAT OPPORTUNITIES ARE EMERGING IN THE MARKET, OR WHICH CUSTOMERS TO TARGET, SHE ADDED.
228	NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OFFSPRING.  I HAVE WORKED IN TRADITIONAL JOBS BEFORE, BUT THERES NOTHING ELSE OUT THERE WHERE YOU CAN SET YOUR OWN SCHEDULE AND YOUR OWN GOALS, SAID MS. FOR EXAMPLE, BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS. DATE: SEPTEMBER 22, 2015 SOURCE: ELIFE SUMMARY: NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OFFSPRING. FOR EXAMPLE, BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS. SHARE: A NEW STUDY CARRIED OUT WITH BURYING BEETLES ALSO SHOWS THAT BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS.  SHE ADDED: "IN ALL MY TIME WORKING HERE, NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE. THE RESEARCH WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL ELIFE. "PARENTS OBVIOUSLY PLAY A HUGE ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR OFFSPRING," SAYS LEAD RESEARCHER PROFESSOR REBECCA KILNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.  IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE A FULL-SIZE KEYBOARD ON THE SCREEN.  HES A PLAYERS GUY AND HAS A LOT OF GUYS HE TRUSTS. "THE AIM OF OUR STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE NON-GENETIC WAYS THAT PARENTS ACHIEVE THIS." THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE COULD SPEED UP THE RATE AT WHICH ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR EVOLVES AND ADAPTS IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD. WHETHER EXAMINING MOTHERS OR FATHERS, THE RESEARCH TEAM FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT RECEIVED NO CARE AS LARVAE WERE LESS EFFECTIVE AT RAISING A LARGE BROOD AS PARENTS, AND DIED YOUNGER. IN CONTRAST, HIGH QUALITY CARE NOT ONLY PRODUCES A LARGER BROOD, BUT INDIVIDUAL OFFSPRING WITH A HIGHER MASS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES. "WE FOUND THAT PARENTAL CARE  PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE. GOOD QUALITY PARENTS PRODUCE OFFSPRING THAT BECOME GOOD PARENTS THEMSELVES, WHILE OFFSPRING THAT RECEIVE POOR PARENTING THEN BECOME LOW QUALITY PARENTS. OUR EXPERIMENTS SHOW HOW PARENTAL CARE ALLOWS OFFSPRING TO INHERIT CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR PARENTS, BUT NON-GENETICALLY," SHE SAYS. HOWEVER, THE TEAM ALSO FOUND THAT OFFSPRING PAY A COST FOR RECEIVING HIGH QUALITY CARE, BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION IF THEY PAIR UP WITH A LOWER QUALITY PARTNER. THIS MAY EXPLAIN WHY ANIMALS OFTEN CHOOSE A MATE THAT IS WILLING TO PUT IN A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF EFFORT AS THEM AS A PARENT. IN THIS WAY, THEY ARE LESS VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION. THE BURYING BEETLE, NICROPHORUS VESPILLOIDES, USES THE CARCASS OF A SMALL VERTEBRATE SUCH AS A MOUSE AS AN EDIBLE NEST FOR ITS YOUNG. AS  ITS NAME SUGGESTS, A BREEDING PAIR BURIES THE CARCASS AND PRESERVES IT WITH AN ANTIBACTERIAL SECRETION. THE MOTHER LAYS EGGS NEARBY IN THE SOIL, AND THE LARVAE CRAWL TO THE CARCASS WHEN THEY HATCH. ALTHOUGH THE LARVAE CAN FEED THEMSELVES, THEY ALSO BEG BOTH PARENTS FOR PARTLY-DIGESTED FOOD FROM THE CARCASS. IN THE CURRENT STUDY, WHEN MALES WERE PAIRED WITH FEMALES THAT HAD RECEIVED NO POST-HATCHING CARE AS LARVAE, THEY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER LIVES THAN THOSE WHOSE PARTNERS HAD RECEIVED MORE CARE. THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT MALES WITH LOW QUALITY PARTNERS PUT MORE EFFORT INTO PARENTAL DUTIES TO COMPENSATE FOR THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THEIR MATE, AND PAID THE PRICE BY DYING YOUNGER.

229	THE LAWRENCE UNIVERSITY VOLLEYBALL TEAM, PLAGUED BY INJURIES AND NONSTOP GRUELING COMPETITION, AIMS TO GET OFF A NINE-GAME LOSING STREAK AS CONFERENCE PLAY BEGINS THIS WEEK. A SERIES OF HIGH-CALIBER TOURNAMENTS KEPT THE LADY VIKES ON THEIR TOES FOR THE ENTIRE MONTH OF SEPT., BUT IT IS TIME TO BEGIN THE REGULAR SEASON WITH STEADY FOCUS. PRE-SEASON IS ALWAYS REALLY DIFFICULT. WE HAVE PLAYED TEAMS THAT ARE RANKED AMONGST THE TOP 25 IN THE NATION, EXPLAINED SOPHOMORE COLLEEN NOWLAN, NAMING TEAMS SUCH AS ELMHURST, WHITEWATER AND EDGEWOOD. IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING, BUT WE GO BACK TO BASICS AND THE BASIC DRIVE TO WIN. A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS JUST TO CREATE THE INTENSITY ON THE COURT TO CARRY US THROUGH THE REGULAR SEASON. ON SEPT. 1, LAWRENCE TRAVELED TO MILWAUKEE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING (MSOE) TO TAKE ON THE RAIDERS AS WELL AS WISCONSIN LUTHERAN COLLEGE IN A TOUGH DOUBLE DUAL RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THE VIKINGS FELL TO BOTH OPPONENTS AS THEY WERE STILL RECOVERING FROM PRE-SEASON CAMPS DEMANDING TRAINING PROGRAM. AT TIMES, THAT PROGRAM LED TO ACHES AND PAINS AS WELL AS MORE SERIOUS INJURIES ON THE TEAM. I SPRAINED MY ANKLE DURING CAMP WEEK. I WAS OUT FOR A WHILE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE FRACTURED IT, SAID NOWLAN. SOME FRESHMEN CAME IN WITH INJURIES FROM THE PAST, AND WITH MULTIPLE TWICE-A-DAYS AND THE INTENSE PRACTICES, THEY KIND OF WORSENED. THAT ESCALATED TO PEOPLE SITTING OUT. FOR OUR SENIORS I THINK IT IS JUST WEAR AND TEAR ON THEIR BODIES. WE DO A LOT OF HARD WORKOUTS. WE LIFT, PRACTICE TWICE A DAY AND RUN A LOT. IT JUST ADDED UP, AND A LOT OF US WERE NOT EXPECTING THAT. IT KNOCKED US ALL OUT. JUST DAYS AFTER THE MSOE DOUBLE DUAL, LU TRAVELED TO ELMHURST COLLEGE IN ILLINOIS FOR A TWO-DAY INVITATIONAL. IN ATTENDANCE WERE ST. MARYS COLLEGE OF INDIANA, NORTH PARK UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AND FONTBONNE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI, ALONG WITH THE HOST TEAM. THIS TOURNAMENT OFFERED A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY CHALLENGING, OUT-OF-STATE TEAMS THAT THE VIKINGS DO NOT NORMALLY SEE. LAWRENCE RETURNED TO APPLETON AT THE END OF THE WEEKEND WITH A 3-1 RECORD, DEFEATING FONTBONNE 3-1 IN THE FINAL GAME OF THE INVITATIONAL. THE VOLLEYBALL TEAMS HOME OPENER AGAINST MARIAN COLLEGE ON SEPT. 9 WAS HARD-FOUGHT AND EXCITING TO WATCH, BUT THE VIKINGS FELL 3-1, THE SCORE OF THE FINAL SET A CLOSE 25-23. FOLLOWING THEIR FIRST HOME GAME, THE LADY VIKES PRE-SEASON WAS MADE UP OF MORE COMPETITION AGAINST MANY ELITE OPPONENTS SUCH AS ST. OLAF, UW-STEVENS POINT AND EDGEWOOD COLLEGE. DURING THOSE PRE-SEASON GAMES WE DID A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL WORK FOR THOSE THAT WERE IN, SAYS NOWLAN. HITTING, GETTING THE FOOTWORK DOWN TO MAYBE PREVENT SOME INJURIES. BY FRIDAY, JUST ABOUT EVERYONE WAS BACK. OUR COACH HAS LESSENED SOME OF IT. WE DO NOT DO STAIRS ANYMORE. IN GAMES, HE WILL THROW SOMEONE ELSE IN TO GIVE SOMEONE A BREAK. WE ARE GOING INTO CONFERENCE COMPETITION NOW SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR LINEUP IS STEADY. THAT LINEUP INCLUDES A NOTABLY YOUNG AND TALENTED TEAM. VIKING VOLLEYBALL HAS NO JUNIORS THIS YEAR AND ONLY TWO SENIORS. UNFORTUNATELY THAT SENIOR LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN LIMITED ON THE COURT DUE TO INJURIES. SENIOR TERESE SWORDS HAS BEEN DEALING WITH A SHOULDER INJURY, BUT THE TEAM IS OPTIMISTIC THAT SHE WILL RECOVER QUICKLY ENOUGH TO PLAY THE SECOND HALF OF THE SEASON. THE OTHER SENIOR, MEGAN CONLEY, IS CURRENTLY WAITING TO HEAR DETAILS ON A HIP INJURY WHICH COULD BE LONG-TERM OR COULD HAVE A QUICK TURNOVER AND HAVE HER BACK ON THE COURT PLAYING AS NEEDED. FRESHMAN NICOLE WITMER, WHO HAS BEEN DOING REHAB FOR AN ACHILLES INJURY, RETURNED TO PRACTICE JUST IN TIME FOR THE REGULAR SEASON. OUR YOUNG TEAM IS GOING REALLY WELL, FIGURING OUT TEAM CHEMISTRY, REVEALED NOWLAN. OFF THE COURT, WERE REALLY CLOSE. WERE ALL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER AND JOKE AROUND A LOT. WERE ALL SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER ON THE COURT. THERES REALLY NOT A LOT OF UNDERLYING COMPETITION. WE WANT EVERYONE TO SUCCEED. ON WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 23, THE VIKINGS HOSTED CARROLL UNIVERSITY, WHOSE 3-10 RECORD GOING INTO CONFERENCE COMPETITION WAS WITHIN REACH OF LAWRENCES TOUGH 1-14 RECORD. THE PIONEERS PLAYED SOME COMPARABLE PRE-SEASON GAMES, LOSING TO SIMILAR TEAMS LIKE WISCONSIN LUTHERAN, MSOE, UW-OSHKOSH AND ELMHURST, ALONG WITH SOME OTHER CHALLENGING OPPONENTS SUCH AS UW-EAU CLAIRE, UW-PLATTEVILLE AND CARTHAGE COLLEGE. TWO MORE HOME GAMES WILL GIVE LAWRENCE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN SOME MOMENTUM FOR THE CONFERENCE SEASON. ON FRIDAY, SEPT. 25, GRINNELL COLLEGE WILL CHALLENGE THE VIKINGS AT ALEXANDER GYMNASIUM, AND SATURDAY, SEPT. 26, IS FAMILY DAY, WHEN CORNELL COLLEGE COMES TO APPLETON TO TAKE ON THE LADY VIKES.

THE RE-DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIELD WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED IN JUNE THIS YEAR, FOLLOWING THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE FIRST OIL ON THE FIELD. THE DISENGAGED WORKERS, SUPPORTED BY THE PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS SENIOR STAFF ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA, ON MONDAY PICKETED THE COMPANYS HEAD OFFICE IN VICTORIA ISLAND, LAGOS. THE CHAIRMAN, PENGASSAN, SAPETRO BRANCH, MR. EMMANUEL ONUORAH, TOLD OUR CORRESPONDENTS THAT THE WORKERS WERE NOT TOLD THEY WERE EMPLOYED FOR THE PROJECT BUT WERE HIRED AS REGULAR WORKERS AND SECONDED TO WORK ON THE PROJECT TO COMPLETION. HE SAID, THE RESTRUCTURING EXERCISE GOING ON AT SAPETRO, BEING DONE BY PWC, WAS A DIFFERENT THING ENTIRELY FROM THE PROJECT. IT WAS WHEN THE PROJECT FAILED AND THE MANAGEMENT DECIDED IN JUNE THIS YEAR TO CALL IT QUITS THAT THEY NOW MIXED THE TWO TOGETHER. THE RESTRUCTURING WAS EVEN SUPPOSED TO INCREASE OUR STAFF STRENGTH FROM 71 TO 100. WE DRILLED THREE WELLS CSW-1, CS 4 AND CS 5. WHEN WE STARTED DRILLING, THE RESERVES DROPPED FROM EIGHT MILLION BARRELS TO FIVE MILLION BARRELS. ONUORAH SAID OIL OF ABOUT 2,500 BARRELS PER DAY WAS FOUND IN ONE OF THE WELLS, BUT IT WAS VERY VISCOUS. SO, TO FLOW IT FROM THE PLATFORM TO ONSHORE BECAME DIFFICULT. BECAUSE OF THAT, THE COMPANY FELT IT DID NOT HAVE FUNDS AGAIN AND THE PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED, HE ADDED. THE CHAIRMAN, PENGASSAN, LAGOS ZONE, MR. ABEL AGARIN, SAID MEMBERS OF THE UNION DECIDED TO PROTEST AS RESULT OF THE COMPANYS REFUSAL TO RENEGOTIATE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE WORKERS. THE ACTING MANAGING DIRECTOR, SAPETRO, MR. DAN OGUCHE, WHILE CONVEYING THE MANAGEMENTS RESPONSE TO THE PROTEST IN A LETTER TO THE UNION, SAID, PLEASE REFER TO THE MEETING HELD BETWEEN SAPETRO MANAGEMENT AND PENGASSAN TODAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2015 AND BE ADVISED AS FOLLOWS: SAPETRO WILL RECALL THE 10 STAFF DISENGAGED ON AUGUST 31, 2015.

ALL THESE BROADBAND INVESTMENTS WERE MADE IN ANTICIPATION THAT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT WILL ENCOURAGE THE PENETRATION OF BROADBAND USAGE TO ABOUT 30% BY THE YEAR 2017. HOWEVER, THE PENETRATION RATE HAS BEEN QUITE LOW, AND STAKEHOLDERS ARE ALREADY CONCERNED. THE CURRENT BROADBAND PENETRATION IN NIGERIA STANDS AT 10%, DESPITE THE COUNTRYS GREAT CAPABILITY. OVER THE LAST WEEKEND, TWO FORUMS WERE HELD WHERE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF GOVERNMENT PUSH TO FAST-TRACK THE ADOPTION OF BROADBAND ACROSS NIGERIA WERE DISCUSSED. THE TWO FORUMS WERE THE NIGERIA INTERNET GROUP (NIG) UNDER THE THEME: INTERNET PENETRATION: THE WAY FORWARD AND THE NIGERIA INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY REPORTERS ASSOCIATION (NITRA) WHICH HELD ITS QUARTERLY SEMINAR UNDER THE THEME: FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AN IMPETUS TO ACHIEVING UBIQUITOUS BROADBAND PENETRATION . ALL THESE FORUMS CENTERED ON THE DISCUSSIONS LOOKING AT VARIOUS WAYS TO REMOVE OBSTACLES PREVENTING HIGHER RATE OF BROADBAND PENETRATION. THE STAKEHOLDERS DESCRIBED THE RATE AS SNAIL SPEED DEVELOPMENT FROWNING AT THE AWKWARD RATE OF PENETRATION REGISTERED IN THE FEW PAST MONTHS. THEY SAY THAT THE MULTIPLE TAXATIONS, DEGRADATION OF THE NAIRA AND THE STATES GOVERNMENT MOVE TO INSTALL FIBER OPTIC CABLES THROUGH THE FEDERATION TO BE CAUSING THE SNAIL-PACED BROADBAND PENETRATION RATE. THEY URGED THE STATE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO LINK UP THE FIBRE OPTIC. ACCORDING TO THEM, THIS MOVE WILL HELP THEM GENERATE MORE REVENUE, AND THE ECONOMYS GDP WILL INCREASE.

233	CANBERRA (AFP) - MALCOLM TURNBULL WAS TO BE SWORN IN AS PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA ON TUESDAY JUST HOURS AFTER MASTERMINDING A COUP AGAINST CONSERVATIVE LEADER TONY ABBOTT AND PLEDGING A NEW ECONOMIC VISION. TURNBULL WILL BE THE COUNTRY'S 29TH PRIME MINISTER -- AND THE FOURTH IN FIVE YEARS AS AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL PARTIES MAINTAIN A BRUTAL TRADITION OF SWIFTLY REMOVING FAILING LEADERS. "I'M FILLED WITH OPTIMISM AND WE WILL BE SETTING OUT IN THE WEEKS AHEAD... MORE OF THOSE FOUNDATIONS THAT WILL ENSURE OUR PROSPERITY IN THE YEARS AHEAD," TURNBULL TOLD REPORTERS. AFTER THE SWEARING IN BY GOVERNOR-GENERAL PETER COSGROVE, THE FORMER COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER WAS TO ATTEND A LIBERAL PARTY MEETING AND THEN HOLD HIS FIRST CABINET SESSION AFTER PLEDGING TO RUN A COLLABORATIVE AND CONSULTATIVE GOVERNMENT, IN CONTRAST TO ABBOTT'S DIVISIVE RULE. THE TIMING FOR THE SWEARING-IN CEREMONY WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY KNOWN. HE WOULD ALSO BE IN PARLIAMENT DURING THE AFTERNOON TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS NEW PRIME MINISTER. "THIS IS A TURN OF EVENTS I DID NOT EXPECT, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, BUT IT'S ONE THAT I'M PRIVILEGED TO UNDERTAKE, AND ONE THAT I'M CERTAINLY UP TO," TURNBULL ADDED. HE WAS WIDELY EXPECTED TO APPOINT SOCIAL SERVICES MINISTER SCOTT MORRISON AS TREASURER TO SELL THE NEW ECONOMIC VISION. "THE PRIME MINISTER (ABBOTT) HAS NOT BEEN CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THE ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP OUR NATION NEEDS", TURNBULL SAID MONDAY. ABBOTT WON POWER IN A GENERAL ELECTION VICTORY IN SEPTEMBER 2013 BUT HIS FIRST BUDGET PROVED HIGHLY UNPOPULAR. HE SURVIVED A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE IN FEBRUARY AFTER POOR POLLING AND A SERIOUS OF GAFFES IGNITED A BACKBENCH REVOLT. AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER TONY ABBOTT (C) WALKS THOUGH PARLIAMENT HOUSE IN CANBERRA AFTER HE WAS DRA BUT ABBOTT HAS SINCE FAILED TO TURN AROUND THE POLLS, BOLSTER THE ECONOMY OR STOP DAMAGING INTERNAL LEAKS AND LOST THE SUPPORT OF THE MAJORITY OF HIS PARTY. AFTER HIS 54-44 VICTORY LATE MONDAY, TURNBULL, A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE FORMER LAWYER AND BANKER, RULED OUT AN EARLY NATIONAL ELECTION TO CEMENT HIS LEADERSHIP. ELECTIONS DO NOT NEED TO BE HELD BEFORE JANUARY 2017. TURNBULL ALSO SAID THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO AUSTRALIA'S CLIMATE POLICY. BUT, WITH STRONG SUPPORT FROM FOREIGN MINISTER JULIE BISHOP, WHO THE PARTY RE-ELECTED DEPUTY LEADER WITH A STRONG 70-30 VOTE IN HER FAVOUR, HE WAS EXPECTED TO SHAKE UP THE CABINET. TURNBULL IS THOUGHT LIKELY TO SWEEP OUT TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVES AND BRING IN YOUNGER BLOOD AND MORE WOMEN. BUT TURNBULL SAID HE WILL NOT ANNOUNCE A RESHUFFLE OF HIS MINISTERS BEFORE FRIDAY. SYDNEY'S DAILY TELEGRAPH HEADLINED "SMILING ASSASSIN" BENEATH A PICTURE OF A BEAMING TURNBULL, NOTING "MALCOLM KNIFES TONY". THE AUSTRALIAN FRONT-PAGED "TURNBULL'S TRIUMPH" WHILE THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD RAN WITH "THE COUP". THE FINANCIAL REVIEW SAID THE LIBERAL PARTY WAS RIPPING ITSELF APART "AMID SCENES OF CARNAGE".
234	FROM A NOTORIOUS CON MAN TO CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES, THIS GRAND HOME -- NAY, THIS GRAND COMPOUND -- IN THE HEART OF THE LOS FELIZ NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS HAS HOUSED QUITE A CAST OF CHARACTERS OVER THE YEARS.  BUILT IN 1929 BY ARCHITECT HARLEY S. BRADLEY FOR A NAMED RUDOLPH ROSENBERG , IT WAS SOLD THE SAME YEAR TO MUSIC STORE MAGNATE BEN PLATT . OVER THE YEARS, PLATT HIRED ARCHITECTS PAUL R.  HANSEN , TO EXPAND IT, ADDING A POOL, TENNIS COURTS, AND ANOTHER STORY TO BRING IT TO ITS CURRENT 10,000-SQUARE-FOOT MEASUREMENT. THE NEXT OWNER WAS A NOTORIOUS CON MAN NAMED C.C. JULIAN , WHOM LISTING AGENT DAVID SOLOMON DESCRIBES AS THE BERNIE MADOFF OF HIS DAY. AFTER HIS COMPANY, THE JULIAN PETROLEUM CORP., WAS FOUND TO HAVE SWINDLED MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE OUT OF $150 MILLION, JULIAN COMMITTED SUICIDE (NOT IN THIS HOME) IN 1934. IN THE LATE 1950S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OWNER TOOK OVER: THE SAINT COLUMBAN'S FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY, A OF CATHOLIC MISSIONARY PRIESTS WHO STILL LIVE THERE TODAY. WHILE THERE BEEN CHANGES MADE TO THE HOME OVER THE YEARS (SPACES WERE DIVIDED TO CREATE ROOMS TO HOUSE SOLOMON SAYS THE HOME RETAINS MANY OF ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES, INCLUDING CARVED FIREPLACES AND DETAILED WOODWORK. THE MOST NOTEWORTHY HISTORIC FEATURE IS A CAVE THAT LEADS TO A HIDDEN WINE CELLAR TO A FULL SPEAK-EASY USED DURING PROHIBITION. ARE ALSO QUARTERS FOR LIVE-IN STAFF. SOLOMON SAYS IT TAKE THE RIGHT BUYER TO BRING THE HOME TO PRESENT-DAY STANDARDS, BUT THE RETURN COULD BE HUGE. CURRENTLY LISTED FOR $5,499,000, THE PROPERTY COULD BE VALUED AT OVER $12 MILLION POSTRENOVATION BASED ON ITS SIZE, HISTORY, AND LOCATION. "WHEN IT'S REDONE, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES IN LOS ANGELES," HE SAYS.  VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS (NASDAQ:VRTX) TRADED DOWN -0.87% ON 16 SEPTEMBER, HITTING $134.27. ALTHOUGH THE HOME IS SET BACK FROM THE ROAD, IT FEATURES AMAZING CITY VIEWS AND IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HOLLYWOOD'S GREEK THEATRE AND GRIFFITH PARK. AS FOR THE NEIGHBORS, THINK HOLLYWOOD STARS.  THE "TWILIGHT" STAR SOLD THE HOME IN 2014, AND NOW JIM PARSONS OF "THE BIG BANG THEORY" LIVES THERE. SO WHO'LL BE NEXT TO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THIS HISTORIC HOME? SOLOMON SAYS WHILE IT COULD BE ANYONE FROM A SINGLE FAMILY TO A PRODUCTION COMPANY, THE LUCKY OWNER WILL DEFINITELY POSSESS ONE QUALITY. "THE RIGHT BUYER WILL BE SOMEONE WHO HAS AN APPRECIATION FOR THE TYPE OF HOME THEY JUST DON'T BUILD ANYMORE," HE SAID. "THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS."

LIKE EVERY NISMO MODEL, THE RS IS INFUSED WITH MOTORSPORT INSPIRED DESIGN, AERODYNAMICS AND ENGINEERING TO DELIVER THRILLING PERFORMANCE AND HANDLING IN A ROAD CAR. "WITH NISSAN JUKE NISMO ALREADY ACCOUNTING FOR THREE PER CENT OF ALL JUKE SALES IN EUROPE, THE ENTHUSIASTS' DESIRE FOR MORE PERFORMANCE IS CLEARLY THERE. THE NEW NISMO RS VERSION OFFERS JUST THAT AND CEMENTS NISMO'S REPUTATION AS CREATORS OF DIGITAL AGE PERFORMANCE," SAID GUILLAUME CARTIER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, SALES AND MARKETING FOR NISSAN IN EUROPE BENEFITING FROM NISMO'S EXTENSIVE GLOBAL MOTORSPORT EXPERIENCE, THE NISMO RS'S ADVANCED 1.6-LITRE DIG-T ENGINE HAS BEEN FINE-TUNED TO BOOST POWER TO 218PS (160KW) FROM 200PS (147KW) WHILE TORQUE IN TWO-WHEEL DRIVE/MANUAL TRANSMISSION VERSIONS IS INCREASED FROM AN ALREADY HEALTHY 250NM TO 280NM. TO ENSURE THE CHASSIS CAN SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFER THE EXTRA TORQUE TO THE ROAD, 2WD MODELS ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE ADDITION OF A MECHANICAL LIMITED SLIP DIFFERENTIAL ON THE DRIVEN FRONT WHEELS. AN LSD IS NOT REQUIRED IN FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE VERSIONS WHICH HAVE TORQUE VECTORING, NISSAN'S XTRONIC TRANSMISSION AND 250NM OF TORQUE. XTRONIC TRANSMISSION MODELS NOW FEATURE STANDARD FIT STEERING WHEEL-MOUNTED PADDLE SHIFTS TO CONTROL THE EIGHT-SPEED MANUAL MODE. THE PERFORMANCE GAINS ARE MATCHED BY AN IMPROVED SOUNDTRACK WITH A RETUNED EXHAUST SYSTEM PROVIDING A SPORTIER ENGINE NOTE THANKS TO A LARGE DIAMETER MUFFLER. OTHER IMPROVEMENTS LINKED TO THE INCREASED ENGINE PERFORMANCE INCLUDE STRATEGIC BODY STRENGTHENING TO INCREASE TORSIONAL STIFFNESS STILL FURTHER, WHILE THE BRAKES HAVE BEEN ENHANCED FOR EVEN BETTER RESISTANCE TO FADE UNDER REPEATED HARD USE - FRONT DISK SIZE HAS INCREASED FROM 296MM TO 320MM, WHILE THE REAR DISCS ARE NOW VENTILATED. REVISED SPRING AND DAMPER SETTINGS COMPLETE THE CHASSIS CHANGES. THE JUKE NISMO RS IS SET APART WITH RED BRAKE CALLIPERS AND DISCREET RS' BADGING ON THE FRONT AND REAR. INSIDE, THE RS LOGO APPEARS IN THE REV COUNTER WHILE A DISTINCTIVE SUEDE WRAP COVERS THE INSTRUMENT BINNACLE. THE FINAL FINISHING TOUCH INSIDE IS AN UNUSUAL WATER PRINT FINISH ON THE SHIFT KNOB/PADDLE SHIFTERS AND THE CENTRAL CLUSTER. OPTIONS ON THE RS VERSION INCLUDE SPECIAL RECARO SPORTS "BUCKET" SEATS, XENON HEADLAMPS, NISSAN'S AROUND VIEW MONITOR AND SAFETY SHIELD WHICH INCLUDES LANE DEPARTURE WARNING, BLIND SPOT WARNING AND MOVING OBJECT DETECTION GIVING VISUAL AND AUDIBLE WARNINGS TO AVOID POTENTIAL COLLISIONS. NEW JUKE NISMO RS IS AVAILABLE IN A CHOICE OF THREE EXTERIOR COLOURS - WHITE PEARL, BLACK METALLIC OR SILVER GREY - WITH A SINGLE BESPOKE INTERIOR TREATMENT: THE PREDOMINANTLY BLACK NISMO CABIN. THE NISMO RS'S AERODYNAMIC EXTERIOR HAS LOWER FRONT AND REAR BUMPERS, WIDER WINGS AND SILL SIDE SKIRTS, PLUS A DARK CHROME V-MOTION GRILLE - COMPLETE WITH NISSAN'S NEW BRAND SIGNATURE - AND TAILGATE SPOILER TO BETTER CONTROL AIRFLOW. DEVELOPED USING EXPERIENCE GAINED ON THE RACETRACK, THE AERODYNAMIC UPGRADES REDUCE FRONT AND REAR LIFT WITHOUT INCREASING DRAG. NISMO EXTERIOR DESIGN CUES INCLUDE RED DOOR MIRROR CAPS AND A RED PINSTRIPE THAT ENCIRCLES THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR. THE PICTURE IS COMPLETED WITH NEW LED DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS SET WITHIN THE LOWER AIR INTAKE GRILLES AT THE FRONT OF THE CAR, WHILE EYE-CATCHING 18-INCH ALLOY WHEELS ACCENTUATE THE NEW JUKE'S BOLD STANCE. THE NISMO TREATMENT CONTINUES INSIDE WITH A PERFORMANCE-ORIENTED STEERING WHEEL, PEDALS, GAUGES, GEAR KNOB AND DOOR TRIMS. SPECIAL SUEDE-TRIMMED NISMO SPORTS SEATS WITH RED STITCHING PROVIDE EXTRA SUPPORT AND COMFORT DURING CORNERING. THE NISMO RS ALSO BENEFIT FROM A NUMBER OF FURTHER CHANGES INTRODUCED ACROSS THE ENTIRE NEW JUKE RANGE. THE MOST OBVIOUS EXTERNAL CHANGES INCLUDE REDESIGNED UPPER LAMPS, REVISED BOOMERANG' TAIL LAMPS AND DOOR MIRRORS WHICH INCORPORATE LED SIDE TURN STRIP REPEATERS. DESPITE ITS PERFORMANCE POTENTIAL, THE JUKE NISMO REMAINS HIGHLY PRACTICAL. 2WD VERSIONS NOW BENEFIT FROM A 40 PER CENT INCREASE IN CARRYING CAPACITY, FOR EXAMPLE, THANKS TO SUBTLE RESHAPING OF THE LUGGAGE AREA, WHILE A TWO-STAGE FLOOR AND FOLD FLAT REAR SEATS MAKE THE SPACE EVEN MORE FLEXIBLE. "NEW JUKE NISMO RS CONFORMS EXACTLY TO THE NISMO ETHOS, PROVIDING AN INSTANT PERFORMANCE FEELING IN A PREMIUM DESIGN INSPIRED BY OUR MOTORSPORT ACTIVITIES. THE RESULT IS ENGAGING, EXCITING AND ACCESSIBLE," SAID GUILLAUME CARTIER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, SALES AND MARKETING FOR NISSAN IN EUROPE. FURTHER DETAILS OF THE NEW JUKE NISMO RS WILL BE REVEALED LATER IN THE YEAR.

242	SHEPSHED DYNAMO ARE OUT OF THE FA CUP FOLLOWING A 4-1 DEFEAT AGAINST RUSHALL OLYMPIC. THE 1ST QUALIFYING ROUND MATCH HAD TO BE REPLAYED ON TUESDAY AFTER SATURDAYS GAME ENDED IN A GOALLESS TIE. DESPITE DYNAMO TAKING AN EARLY LEAD, RUSHALL, BACK ON THEIR OWN GROUND, PROVIDED A STERNER TEST AND IT IS OLYMPIC WHO WILL TRAVEL TO CORBY TOWN IN THE FA CUP 2ND QUALIFYING ROUND. SHEPSHED OPENED STRONGLY WITH PORTER CLOSE IN THE EARLY MINUTES. THEN ON THREE MINUTES IT COULD BE DEFINED AS A POSSIBLE GAME CHANGING INCIDENT. JAKE BETTS BACK PASS WAS CLEARED BY LAURIE PEARSON BUT WAS CAUGHT BY A LATE TACKLE FROM LUKE BENBOW. AFTER A LENGTHY DELAY WHILE PEARSON RECEIVED TREATMENT, SHEPSHED RESTARTED WITH BETTS GOAL KICK FINDING PORTER WHO SHRUGGED OFF MITCHELL TOLLEY AND MOVED THE BALL INSIDE TO DUFFY. HIS THROUGH BALL FOUND REEVE TO SHOOT PAST DEAN COLEMAN TO GIVE SHEPSHED AN EARLY LEAD. THREE MINUTES LATER, PEARSON WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE AND WAS REPLACED BY ALEX DAVIES. SHEPSHED CAME CLOSE AGAIN ON FIFTEEN MINUTES, REEVE AND LANGHAM COMBINING WELL BUT DUFFYS EFFORT WAS DEFLECTED OVER. SHEPSHED WERE TAKING THE GAME TO RUSHALL AND THEIR ONLY EFFORT OF NOTE WAS ON 17 MINUTES, ALEX REID FINDING LUKE BENBOW BUT HIS SHOT WENT WIDE. DYNAMO HAD FURTHER EFFORTS THROUGH MIVELD AND PORTER GOING CLOSE. RUSHALL BEGAN TO BREAK THE GAME DOWN AND BEGAN TO EXERT THEIR HIGHER LEAGUE INFLUENCE, DAVIES SAVING FROM BENBOW ON 25 MINUTES AND AGAIN THREE MINUTES LATER. RUSHALL EQUALISED ON 37 MINUTES, A DIAGONAL BALL BY TOLLEY CAUGHT OUT THE SHEPSHED DEFENCE AND ROBERTS CURLED HIS RIGHT FOOT SHOT PAST DAVIES. THREE MINUTES LATER AND OLYMPIC WERE IN FRONT, THE BALL WAS FLICKED ON FROM A THROW IN AND ALEX REID HELD THE BALL UP, TURNED AND FIRED PAST DAVIES. SHEPSHED WERE UNLUCKY NOT TO LEVEL STRAIGHT FROM THE KICK OFF, REEVES EFFORT TIPPED ONTO THE POST FOR A CORNER BY COLEMAN. FOUR MINUTES INTO THE HALF RUSHALL EXTENDED THEIR LEAD, REID LATCHING ONTO A THROUGH BALL TO SLOT PAST DAVIES. RUSHALL WERE BEGINNING TO CONTROL THE GAME AND ON 56 MINUTES A SPECULATIVE LOB FROM BENBOW WAS MET WITH A FIERCE VOLLEY BY REID FOR HIS HAT TRICK. SHEPSHED DIDNT GIVE UP AND DUFFY WENT CLOSE WITH A FREE KICK AND MEADE WAS THEN DEEMED OFFSIDE. RUSHALL CONTINUED TO PRESS AND DAVIES PROVIDED A SUCCESSION OF FINE SAVES BEFORE SAM YOUNG BROUGHT DOWN MALACHITE FARQUHARSON FOR A PENALTY BUT DEBUTANTE REPLACEMENT DAVIES IN THE SHEPSHED GOAL WAS EQUAL TO REIDS SPOT KICK. RUSHALL WERE IN SEARCH OF A FIFTH WITH 12 MINUTES TO GO. FARQUHARSONS HEADER LOOKED GOAL BOUND BUT DAVIES PULLED OFF A FINE SAVE TO TIP THE BALL OVER THE TOP. ALTHOUGH THE GAME WAS OUT OF SHEPSHEDS REACH, THEY FINISHED THE GAME STRONG WITH ADAM HOHNS HEADER TIPPED OVER BY COLEMAN AND REEVES PULL BACK CLEARED. ONCE RUSHALL OLYMPIC HAD TAKEN THE LEAD, THEY USED THEIR HIGHER LEAGUE EXPERIENCE TO THEIR ADVANTAGE BUT SHEPSHED CAN TAKE A LOT FROM THE TWO GAMES. ATTENTIONS TURN BACK TO THE MIDLAND FOOTBALL LEAGUE ACTION AS THE TEAM TRAVEL TO HEREFORD ON SATURDAY. TUESDAYS LEAGUE CUP GAME AGAINST LOUGHBOROUGH UNI HAS BEEN REARRANGED AND WILL NOW TAKE PLACE AT THE DOVECOTE ON SEPTEMBER 29.
243	ON AUG 31, WE ISSUED AN UPDATED RESEARCH REPORT ON PAINTS AND COATINGS MAKER VALSPAR ( VAL - ANALYST REPORT ). VALSPAR SAW HIGHER PROFITS IN THIRD-QUARTER FISCAL 2015 (ENDED JUL 31, 2015) ON THE BACK OF SOLID COMMERCIAL EXECUTION AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER SURPASSED THE ZACKS CONSENSUS ESTIMATE WHILE REVENUES LAGGED THE SAME. THE COMPANY RAISED THE LOWER END OF ITS EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2015. VALSPAR HAS A BROAD PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHARE GAINS IN BOTH ITS PAINTS AND COATINGS SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY SHOULD CONTINUE TO GAIN FROM NEW BUSINESS WINS, INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH INITIATIVES AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. WINNING NEW BUSINESSES REMAIN A COMPANY-WIDE FOCUS THAT WILL POSITION VALSPAR WELL FOR THE FUTURE. THE ACQUISITION OF PAINT MANUFACTURING ASSETS OF ACE HARDWARE HAS REINFORCED VALSPAR RETAIL FOOTHOLD IN THE U.S. MOREOVER, VALSPAR HAS STRENGTHENED ITS POSITION IN THE $6 BILLION EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MARKET WITH THE TAKEOVER OF ITALY-BASED INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MAKER INVER HOLDING S.R.L. THE PURCHASE OF QUEST SPECIALTY CHEMICALS PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESSES HAS ALSO STRENGTHENS VALSPAR'S FOOTHOLD IN THE ATTRACTIVE AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH MARKET. THE COMPANY IS LOOKING TO BOOST SALES WITH THE INTEGRATION OF QUEST CHEMICALS. THE ACQUISITION ADDED 6% TO PAINTS SEGMENTS SALES IN THE THIRD QUARTER. IN ADDITION, VALSPARS PAINT BUSINESS IS ALSO BENEFITING FROM CONTINUED ROLLOUT OF VALSPAR BRANDED PRODUCTS AT ACE HARDWARE. MOREOVER, VALSPAR RESERVE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR PAINTS ARE ALSO DRIVING SALES IN THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CHANNEL. VALSPAR IS AGGRESSIVELY INVESTING IN PROMOTING THIS PRODUCT. VALSPAR IS ALSO MANAGING ITS COST WELL AND MAINTAINING A COST STRUCTURE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CURRENT EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. IT ALSO REMAINS COMMITTED TO BOOST SHAREHOLDER RETURN LEVERAGING HEALTHY CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, VALSPAR FACES CURRENCY HEADWINDS, STEMMING FROM A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR. UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY SWINGS REDUCED ITS SALES BY 5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER. CURRENCY HEADWIND IS EXPECTED WEIGH ON ITS SALES FOR FISCAL 2015. THE COMPANY NOW SEES ITS REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2015 TO FALL IN THE MID SINGLE-DIGITS YEAR OVER YEAR VERSUS A LOW SINGLE-DIGITS DECLINE EXPECTED EARLIER. WE ALSO ACCOUNT FOR VOLATILITY IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS. VALSPAR HAS EXPERIENCED DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLIES OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT VARIOUS TIMES, IMPACTING ITS ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS. THE OVERALL DEMAND ENVIRONMENT ALSO REMAINS UNEVEN. VALSPAR CURRENTLY SPORTS A ZACKS RANK #3 (HOLD). OTHER STOCKS TO CONSIDER OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BASIC MATERIALS SPACE WORTH CONSIDERING INCLUDE INNOSPEC INC. ( IOSP - SNAPSHOT REPORT ), AIR PRODUCTS & CHEMICALS INC. ( APD - ANALYST REPORT ) AND LYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V. ( LYB - ANALYST REPORT ).

244	COLUMBUS, OHIO , SEPT. 30, 2015 /PRNEWSWIRE/ --BERNZOMATIC, THE INDUSTRY LEADER IN HANDHELD TORCHES SINCE 1876, TODAY ANNOUNCED THE LAUNCH OF THE FIRST AND ONLY PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION PROGRAM ON PROPER USE AND DISPOSAL OF HANDHELD NON-REFILLABLE FUEL CYLINDERS, CALLED CYLINDERSAFE . EACH YEAR, MILLIONS OF HANDHELD NON-REFILLABLE FUEL CYLINDERS ARE SOLD TO TACKLE PROJECTS FROM PLUMBING AND ELECTRICAL WORK TO CRAFT MAKING, UPCYCLING, COOKING AND GRILLING. HOWEVER, MANY USERS ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT SAFE USAGE AND DISPOSAL IN FACT, MORE THAN A THIRD OF AMERICANS WOULD LIKE TO LEARN ABOUT HANDHELD FUEL CYLINDER SAFETY OR SAFE DISPOSAL 1 . WHAT'S MORE, IMPROPER CYLINDER USE, TRANSPORTATION OR STORAGE COULD LEAD TO INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE. "OUR PRODUCTS FUEL THE PASSIONS OF MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS EVERY YEAR, AND WE WANT EVERY ONE OF THEM TO PURSUE THEIR PROJECTS SAFELY," SAID MIKE VERNE , CONSUMER PRODUCTS GENERAL MANAGER FOR WORTHINGTON INDUSTRIES, PARENT COMPANY TO BERNZOMATIC AND THE NATION'S LARGEST MANUFACTURER OF NON-REFILLABLE HANDHELD FUEL CYLINDERS. "CYLINDERSAFE IS THE NEXT STEP IN CONTINUALLY ADVANCING OUR SAFETY MISSION, ENSURING THAT AS INDUSTRY LEADERS, WE MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE FOR CUSTOMERS TO ACCESS THE IMPORTANT SAFETY AND DISPOSAL INFORMATION THEY DESIRE ALL IN ONE CENTRAL PLACE." THE NEWLY CREATED CYLINDERSAFE WEBSITE IS A RESOURCE FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO PROPERLY USE, STORE AND DISPOSE OF THEIR NON-REFILLABLE CYLINDERS. AS DISPOSAL PROCEDURES FOR THESE CYLINDERS VARY BY MUNICIPALITY, THE SITE FEATURES A BUILT-IN SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY FOR VISITORS TO RESEARCH THEIR LOCAL SOLID WASTE AUTHORITY'S CONTACT INFORMATION. THE SERVICE, WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR CONSUMERS IN ONE PLACE, IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND. THE SITE ALSO HAS AN INSTRUCTIONAL CYLINDER SAFETY VIDEO AND A COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY CHECKLIST, WHICH INCLUDES TIPS SUCH AS: CHECK CYLINDER AND APPLIANCE SEALS BEFORE USING. NEVER USE CYLINDERS WITH DAMAGED OR MISSING SEALS. DISCARD CYLINDERS IF DIRT OR RUST PARTICLES ARE PRESENT IN VALVE AREAS. CHECK FOR LEAKS ONCE APPLIANCES ARE ATTACHED BY APPLYING SOAPY WATER TO CONNECTIONS AND LOOKING FOR BUBBLES. ALSO LISTEN FOR THE HISS OF ESCAPING GAS, FEEL FOR EXTREME COLD AND SMELL FOR ROTTEN EGG ODORS. DO NOT USE IF YOU DETECT FUEL IS LEAKING. MAKE SURE YOUR TORCH HEAD OR APPLIANCE IS TURNED OFF BEFORE ATTACHING A FUEL CYLINDER . BE SURE TO HOLD THE CYLINDER UPRIGHT WHILE ATTACHING HOSES OR APPLIANCES AND HAND TIGHTEN ONLY. NEVER USE TOOLS TO TIGHTEN, AS OVER-TIGHTENING CAN DAMAGE SEALS. ATTACH AND DETACH HAND TORCHES AND APPLIANCES OUTDOORS AWAY FROM PILOT LIGHTS, FLAMES, SPARKS AND OTHER IGNITION SOURCES. THEY CAN IGNITE LEAKING GAS. DURING USE, HOLD HAND TORCHES UPRIGHT TO PREVENT FLARE-UPS OR FLASHES . IF THE APPLIANCE SPUTTERS OR FLARES UP, TURN THE CYLINDER UPRIGHT AND TURN THE UNIT OFF. VENT THE AREA TO REMOVE UNBURNED GAS. ALLOW HAND TORCHES AND APPLIANCES TO COOL AFTER USE . DETACH THE FUEL CYLINDER FROM THE TORCH OR APPLIANCE WHEN NOT IN USE AND REPLACE CAPS TO KEEP VALVES CLEAN.

245	CONTINUO A COPIARE, SONO QUI: [DOC]/GUIDE/MACROS.HTML, ANZI QUI: [DOC]/GUIDE/PROC-MACROS.HTML. AGGREGARE PATTERNS ED ESPRESSIONI: SYNTAX-CASE THE PROCEDURE GENERATED BY SYNTAX-RULES INTERNALLY USES SYNTAX-E TO DECONSTRUCT THE GIVEN SYNTAX OBJECT, AND IT USES DATUM->SYNTAX TO CONSTRUCT THE RESULT. THE SYNTAX-RULES FORM DOESNT PROVIDE A WAY TO ESCAPE FROM PATTERN-MATCHING AND TEMPLATE-CONSTRUCTION MODE INTO AN ARBITRARY RACKET EXPRESSION. THE SYNTAX-CASE FORM LETS YOU MIX PATTERN MATCHING, TEMPLATE CONSTRUCTION, AND ARBITRARY EXPRESSIONS: (SYNTAX-CASE STX-EXPR (LITERAL-ID ...) [PATTERN EXPR] ...) UNLIKE SYNTAX-RULES, THE SYNTAX-CASE FORM DOES NOT PRODUCE A PROCEDURE. INSTEAD, IT STARTS WITH A STX-EXPR EXPRESSION THAT DETERMINES THE SYNTAX OBJECT TO MATCH AGAINST THE PATTERNS. ALSO, EACH SYNTAX-CASE CLAUSE HAS A PATTERN AND EXPR, INSTEAD OF A PATTERN AND TEMPLATE. WITHIN AN EXPR, THE SYNTAX FORMUSUALLY ABBREVIATED WITH #'SHIFTS INTO TEMPLATE-CONSTRUCTION MODE; IF THE EXPR OF A CLAUSE STARTS WITH #', THEN WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A SYNTAX-RULES FORM: WE COULD WRITE THE SWAP MACRO USING SYNTAX-CASE INSTEAD OF DEFINE-SYNTAX-RULE OR SYNTAX-RULES: ONE ADVANTAGE OF USING SYNTAX-CASE IS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE BETTER ERROR REPORTING FOR SWAP. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE DEFINE-SYNTAX-RULE DEFINITION OF SWAP, THEN (SWAP X 2) PRODUCES A SYNTAX ERROR IN TERMS OF SET!, BECAUSE 2 IS NOT AN IDENTIFIER. WE CAN REFINE OUR SYNTAX-CASE IMPLEMENTATION OF SWAP TO EXPLICITLY CHECK THE SUB-FORMS: WITH THIS DEFINITION, (SWAP X 2) PROVIDES A SYNTAX ERROR ORIGINATING FROM SWAP INSTEAD OF SET!. IN THE ABOVE DEFINITION OF SWAP, #'X AND #'Y ARE TEMPLATES, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT USED AS THE RESULT OF THE MACRO TRANSFORMER. THIS EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES HOW TEMPLATES CAN BE USED TO ACCESS PIECES OF THE INPUT SYNTAX, IN THIS CASE FOR CHECKING THE FORM OF THE PIECES. ALSO, THE MATCH FOR #'X OR #'Y IS USED IN THE CALL TO RAISE-SYNTAX-ERROR, SO THAT THE SYNTAX-ERROR MESSAGE CAN POINT DIRECTLY TO THE SOURCE LOCATION OF THE NON-IDENTIFIER. WITH-SYNTAX E GENERATE-TEMPORARIES SINCE SYNTAX-CASE LETS US COMPUTE WITH ARBITRARY RACKET EXPRESSIONS, WE CAN MORE SIMPLY SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT WE HAD IN WRITING DEFINE-FOR-CBR (SEE EXTENDED EXAMPLE: CALL-BY-REFERENCE FUNCTIONS UN ESEMPIO ESTESO: FUNZIONI CALL-BY-REFERENCE), WHERE WE NEEDED TO GENERATE A SET OF NAMES BASED ON A SEQUENCE ID ...: (DEFINE-SYNTAX (DEFINE-FOR-CBR STX) (SYNTAX-CASE STX () [(_ DO-F (ID ...) BODY) .... #'(DEFINE (DO-F GET ... PUT ...) (DEFINE-GET/PUT-ID ID GET PUT) ... BODY) ....])) IN PLACE OF THE ....S ABOVE, WE NEED TO BIND GET ... AND PUT ... TO LISTS OF GENERATED IDENTIFIERS. WE CANNOT USE LET TO BIND GET AND PUT, BECAUSE WE NEED BINDINGS THAT COUNT AS PATTERN VARIABLES, INSTEAD OF NORMAL LOCAL VARIABLES. THE WITH-SYNTAX FORM LETS US BIND PATTERN VARIABLES: NOW WE NEED AN EXPRESSION IN PLACE OF .... THAT GENERATES AS MANY IDENTIFIERS AS THERE ARE ID MATCHES IN THE ORIGINAL PATTERN. SINCE THIS IS A COMMON TASK, RACKET PROVIDES A HELPER FUNCTION, GENERATE-TEMPORARIES, THAT TAKES A SEQUENCE OF IDENTIFIERS AND RETURNS A SEQUENCE OF GENERATED IDENTIFIERS: THIS WAY OF GENERATING IDENTIFIERS IS NORMALLY EASIER TO THINK ABOUT THAN TRICKING THE MACRO EXPANDER INTO GENERATING NAMES WITH PURELY PATTERN-BASED MACROS. IN GENERAL, THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF A WITH-SYNTAX BINDING IS A PATTERN, JUST LIKE IN SYNTAX-CASE. IN FACT, A WITH-SYNTAX FORM IS JUST A SYNTAX-CASE FORM TURNED PARTIALLY INSIDE-OUT. :MRGREEN:

SEP 24, 2015 IN 2012, SCOTT SEWARDS HERD ROLLING HERD AVERAGE WAS JUST OVER 28,500 POUND OF MILK. WHILE MANY WOULD ENJOY THAT LEVEL OF PRODUCTION, IT WAS BELOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THE WISCONSIN DAIRYMAN. OUR HERD AVERAGE HIT 30,000M IN 1992. WEVE BEEN THE TOP HERD IN THE COUNTY FOR OVER 20 YEARS, SCOTT SAYS. SO WHEN FELL TO 28,500M, IT WAS TIME TO LOOK FOR A NEW NUTRITIONIST. SCOTT STARTED WORKING WITH BENNET CROCHET IN MAY 2012 UPON THE ADVICE OF HIS VETERINARIAN. HES FOUND THE CARGILL DAIRY FOCUS CONSULTANT TO BE THE RIGHT ADVISOR TO HELP THE 420-COW HERD ACHIEVE HIS PRODUCTION DREAMS. ROLLING HERD AVERAGE ON THE REGISTERED HOLSTEIN HERD IS NOW 35,400M WITH 3.6% FAT AND 3.12% PROTEIN. MORE IMPORTANTLY, COW LONGEVITY AND HEALTH HAS IMPROVED. SCOTT NOW HAS A PEN FULL OF HIGH-PRODUCING COWS IN THEIR THIRD LACTATION OR MORE. I LIKE HAVING GOOD LOOKING COWS THAT LAST, HE REMARKS. THREE COWS HAVE PRODUCED OVER 320,000 POUNDS OF MILK LIFETIME. THE NEARLY 100% HOMEGROWN HERD HAS A BREED AGE ADJUSTED (BAA) SCORE OF 103.8. BENNET WALKS THE HERD EVERY THREE WEEKS AND IS AN INVALUABLE SECOND SET OF EYES FOR THE FOURTH GENERATION DAIRYMAN. HES HELPED US GET TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY, SCOTT SAYS OF BENNET. HE HELPS US GET BETTER. THE DIET IS HEAVY IN FORAGES GROWN ON THE 900-ACRE FARM. 60% OF THE CORN IS BMR AND HAYLAGE IS STORED IN BAGS. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IM TOO PICKY, BUT IM NOT AFRAID OF A LITTLE EXTRA WORK IF IT GETS US MORE MILK, SCOTT SAYS. BENNET HAS WORKED WITH SCOTT ON HIS FRESH COWS RECENTLY. URINE PH IS MONITORED ROUTINELY AND RATION PARTICLE LENGTH AND MOISTURE CONTENT ARE WATCHED CLOSELY. ITS THE LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE FOR SEWARDS DAIRY. THE ONLY REAL HOBBY I HAVE IS HUNTING, SO WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME AT THE DAIRY, SCOTT SAYS WITH A LAUGH. AND ITS THIS HIGH-LEVEL OF INTENSITY WITH WHICH HE MANAGES HIS DAIRY THAT MAKES CARGILL THE PERFECT FIT TO HELP FEED SEWARDS DAIRY DREAMS.

247	MT. PLEASANT NEWS WINFIELD ZONING IS ALIVE AND WELL IN WINFIELD FOLLOWING ACTION BY THE CITY COUNCIL THURSDAY NIGHT. MEETING IN SPECIAL SESSION, THE COUNCIL APPOINTED FIVE LOCAL CITIZENS TO THE CITYS BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT/PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION. THE APPOINTEES INCLUDE LINDA SHARP, PAUL BEATY, TOM RODRUCK, JERRY FRICKE AND CHRIS FINNELL. FINNELL, WHO ALSO SERVES AS WINFIELD MAYOR, DID NOT SEE SERVING ON THE BOARD AND COMMISSION AS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. I AM THE MAYOR, BUT TECHNICALLY I AM NOT ON THE COUNCIL, I DO NOT HAVE A VOTE (ON COUNCIL). IF THIS DOESNT FLY, WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER MEETING, FINNELL SAID. COUNCIL MEMBER JAN WALTER SAID SHE DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FINNELL SERVING ON THE BOARD AND COMMISSION. WE CAN APPROVE IT AND IF IT IS A PROBLEM, WE CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE. THE COUNCILS ACTION THURSDAY NIGHT RESULTED FROM A DISCUSSION WITH JOE BUFFINGTON, HENRY COUNTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING AND ZONING, DURING THE COUNCILS REGULAR MONTHLY MEETING ON SEPT. 14. BUFFINGTON TOLD THE COUNCIL THAT WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT, IT PUTS THE COMMUNITY IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION REGARDING ZONING. YOU DONT HAVE THE TOOLS IN PLACE (WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT) TO HAVE ZONING, PERIOD, BUFFINGTON TOLD THE COUNCIL AT ITS PREVIOUS MEETING. YOU DONT HAVE A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT SO THERE IS NO DUE PROCESS. IF YOU HAVE CHALLENGES (TO ZONING ORDINANCES), IT COULD BE A MESS BECAUSE YOU LOST YOUR ABILITY TO ZONE WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. IN ORDER TO HAVE ZONING, YOU MUST HAVE A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. THE CITY, BUFFINGTON SAID, COULD HAVE THE SAME CITIZENS ON BOTH THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT AND PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION. A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT IS COMPRISED OF FIVE MEMBERS AND HANDLES ZONING AND VARIANCE MATTERS. WALTER, WHO SERVED AS CITY CLERK FOR THREE DECADES SAID THE COMMUNITY HASNT HAD A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT FOR AT LEAST A DECADE. SHE SAID THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE LACK OF A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT WAS FINDING PEOPLE WILLING TO SERVE ON THE BOARD. IN THE ONLY OTHER AGENDA MATTER, THE COUNCIL SET A 4 P.M. HEARING MONDAY, OCT. 12, FOR THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT TO CONSIDER A VARIANCE FOR THE WINFIELD HEALTH CARE AND RETIREMENT CENTER. THE COUNCILS NEXT MEETING WILL ALSO BE ON MONDAY, OCT. 12, AT 7 P.M. IN CITY HALL.
248	CREDIT: THINKSTOCK ( THIS ARTICLE APPEARED PREVIOUSLY ON MARKETWATCH. ) JUST WHEN I THINK IVE HEARD EVERY BAD REASON FOR TAKING SOCIAL SECURITY EARLY, ANOTHER ONE POPS UP. UNDERSTAND THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO TAKE SOCIAL SECURITY EARLY. BUT BAD REASONS ARENT SUPPORTED BY THE FACTS. HERE ARE THE TOP FIVE BAD REASONS: 1. ILL GET MORE MONEY BY TAKING IT EARLY. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO BET ON DYING YOUNG? DO THE MATH. TAKE SOCIAL SECURITY AT 66 INSTEAD OF 62, AND YOURE MONEY AHEAD BY AGE 78. TAKE IT AT 70 AND YOURE AHEAD BY 82 1/2 BEFORE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY. MARRIED? DELAYING SOCIAL SECURITY CAN MEAN MORE MONEY FOR THE LONGER-LIVING SPOUSE TOO. FACT-BASED APPROACH: SEE IF FILING EARLY PAYS. ESTIMATE YOUR LIFE EXPECTANCY AT SITES LIKE LIVING TO 100AND BLUE ZONES, OR VIEW AVERAGES ON A TABLE. ESTIMATE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENT FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (SSA) AT SSAS WEBSITE. MOREFOR RETIREMENT PLANNING, GET THE SPIRIT OF 76 COMPUTE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF YOUR FIRST FEW YEARS OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND CONSIDER SETTING ASIDE THAT CASH TO REPLACE THOSE EARLY PAYMENTS. 2. MY FRIEND DIED BEFORE HE GOT SOCIAL SECURITY. AFTER PAYING FOR DECADES, THE IDEA OF GETTING NOTHING IS GALLING. BUT THINK ABOUT THIS PAINFUL FACT: AN EARLY DEATH MEANS YOU NO LONGER NEED LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLANNING. ACTUARY AND AUTHOR STEVE VERNON SUGGESTS YOUR BIGGER PROBLEM IS A LATE DEATH, WITH THE NEED TO FUND A LONG LIFE. FACT-BASED APPROACH: REMEMBER THAT, ON AVERAGE, YOU AND YOUR SPOUSE GET MORE SOCIAL SECURITY BY DELAYING (SEE BAD REASON #1). SOCIAL SECURITY IS EXCELLENT LONGEVITY PROTECTION, SO DONT SETTLE FOR A SMALLER EARLY PAYMENT. 3. I CANT STAND MY JOB. UNDERSTOOD. SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO LEAVE, EVEN IF IT COSTS. BUT IT DOESNT FOLLOW THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE SOCIAL SECURITY NOW UNLESS YOU REALLY NEED THE MONEY. FACT-BASED APPROACH: PLAN YOUR LANDING BEFORE YOU BAIL OUT. THINK ABOUT ALTERNATIVES TO TAKING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY EARLY. A FUN PART-TIME JOB WILL PAY BETTER. DRAWING DOWN YOUR SAVINGS MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE. TALK TO A FEE-BASED FINANCIAL PLANNER. THE SOCIAL SECURITY IS THERE IF YOU NEED IT, BUT ITS NOT THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO YOUR YUCKY JOB. 4. I DONT WANT TO SPEND DOWN MY SAVINGS. YES, ITS REALLY HARD TO START SPENDING YOUR NEST EGG. BUT IN SOME CASES, IT MAKES GOOD SENSE. COMPUTE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF YOUR FIRST FEW YEARS OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND CONSIDER SETTING ASIDE CASH TO REPLACE THOSE EARLY PAYMENTS. YOU COULD COME OUT AHEAD IN THE LONG RUN. MOREHOW TO GENERATE RETIREMENT INCOME FROM SAVINGS CONSIDER TAXES, TOO: IF YOURE BLESSED WITH A LARGE TRADITIONAL INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA), THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE WILL FORCE REQUIRED MINIMUM WITHDRAWALS (RMDS) AT 70 1/2, AS YOU CAN SEE HERE. THE LARGER YOUR IRA, THE BIGGER THE WITHDRAWALS AND THE TAX BITE. BY CONTRAST, IF YOU PARTIALLY DRAW DOWN YOUR IRA EARLY AND DELAY SOCIAL SECURITY UNTIL 70, YOUR FORCED WITHDRAWALS WILL BE LOWER, AND YOUR RELATIVELY HIGHER SOCIAL SECURITY IS TAX ADVANTAGED. FACT-BASED APPROACH: LOOK AT YOUR SAVINGS VS. YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENT AND CONSIDER CREATING A REPLACEMENT FUND. TALK TO A FINANCIAL PLANNER OR TAX PROFESSIONAL ABOUT EARLY VS. LATE IRA WITHDRAWALS. 5. SOCIAL SECURITY IS GOING BROKE. YOURE THINKING SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT ANY DAY NOW, AND YOU WANT TO GET YOURS BEFORE THE MONEYS GONE. THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS WITH THIS. FIRST, SOCIAL SECURITY ISNT BROKE. THE LATEST ACCOUNTING SHOWS ITS 100PERCENTSOLVENT UNTIL 2034. NOT EXACTLY AN IMMINENT TRAIN WRECK. AND AFTER 2034, IT COULD CONTINUE TO PAY 79PERCENTOF BENEFITS, NOT A BANKRUPT ZERO. THAT ASSUMES NO FIX BEFORE THEN. SECOND, EVERY PROPOSED FIX GIVES OLDER PEOPLE A BREAK, BY FOCUSING TAX INCREASES OR BENEFIT CUTS ON YOUNGER GENERATIONS. IF YOURE ALREADY SOCIAL SECURITY AGE, THERES NO BIG RUSH.

250	IT IS QUITE OFTEN THE CASE IN THIS GIG THAT YOU ARE ENTRUSTED WITH CERTAIN CARS WHICH NATURALLY EXCITE GREAT INTEREST AMONG THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IN CERTAIN SUCH INSTANCES YOU WILL BE INUNDATED BY EXCITABLE SMALL BOYS, OVERWHELMED ADULTS AND ALL MANNER OF OTHER CURIOUS PEOPLE. IN RECENT MEMORY, CARS SUCH AS THE BMW I8 AND THE F-TYPE JAGUAR CREATED JUST SUCH A REACTION. WE HAVE EVEN HAD PEOPLE CALL TO THE FRONT DOOR UNANNOUNCED AND SPONTANEOUS ANXIOUS TO DISCUSS THE MERITS OF THE NEW FORD FOCUS RS WHICH THEY JUST HAPPENED TO SPOT IN THE DRIVEWAY. INDEED, THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PUBLIC AT LARGE FOR CARS WHICH ENTHRAL, EXCITE AND ENTHUSE THEM, NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE. BY AND LARGE THOUGH, YOUD DONT GENERALLY EXPECT THAT SORT OF REACTION WHEN YOU HAVE A ?SKODA. BUT SUCH WAS THE CASE RECENTLY WITH THE NEW ?SKODA SUPERB WHICH WE HAD IN OUR POSSESSION FOR A PERIOD LONGER THAN THE NORMAL WEEK WHICH IS AFFORDED BY MOST CAR COMPANIES FOR TEST PURPOSES. THROUGHOUT THE TIME THE CAR WAS WITH US, IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF CONCERTED AND PROTRACTED PUBLIC INTEREST TO A LEVEL THAT YOU JUST DONT EVER SEE WITH CONVENTIONAL MACHINERY. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS COMPLETELY UNSURPRISED BY THE LEVELS OF ATTENTION THAT THE SUPERB GENERATED BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS THIS A STUNNING LOOKING CAR UNLIKE ITS PREDECESSOR WHICH WAS MERELY GOOD-LOOKING BY COMPARISON BUT IT IS IMBUED WITH EVEN MORE OF THE COMFORT, SPACIOUSNESS, PRACTICALITY AND DEFT DESIGNS TOUCHES THAT MADE THE PREVIOUS CAR SUCH A WILD HIT WITH THE BUYING PUBLIC. HAVING SEEN THE CAR IN A STATIC DISPLAY IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC BACK IN FEBRUARY, I KNEW THAT ?SKODA HAD DONE A BRILLIANT JOB OF UPDATING THE SUPERB, BUT IT WAS ONLY WHEN I SAW THE CAR TRULY IN THE FLESH AND AWAY FROM THE STERILE FORUM OF A PRAGUE THEATRE, I REALISED JUST QUITE WHAT A FANTASTIC JOB JOSEF KABAN AND HIS DESIGN TEAM AT ?SKODA AUTO HAD DONE WITH THIS CAR. I HAVE HEARD IT SAID THAT THE LOOK OF THE NEW CAR AS BEING AN EXERCISE IN SCULPTED MODERN MINIMALISM BUT I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ALL THAT ARTY PIFFLE-SPEAK SOME PEOPLE COME OUT WITH IN RELATION TO CARS AND FIND IT BEST SIMPLY TO ALLOW YOUR OWN EYES JUDGE THE BEAUTY OR OTHERWISE OF ANY AUTOMOTIVE CREATION. WHILE SUCH JUDGEMENTS ARE RIGHTLY AND PROPERLY BOUND BY PERSONAL SUBJECTIVITY, I HAVE TO SAY I DID NOT COME ACROSS ONE DISSENTING VOICE DURING MY TIME WITH THE CAR THAT QUESTIONED ITS STUNNING LOOKS. FROM ANY ANGLE THIS THING LOOKS PURPOSEFUL, MODERN, UNIQUE AND, WELL, HUGE. THE SUPERB HAS ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS A BIG CAR AND, TO BE HONEST, IF I HAD A EURO FOR EVERY TIME I HAVE BORED PEOPLE WITH THE IT HAS MORE REAR LEGROOM THAN AN S-CLASS MERC LINE, THE BANK BALANCE WOULD BE A LOT MORE PROSPEROUS LOOKING. FOR DIEHARD FANS (AND THERE ARE ALREADY A GROWING NUMBER OF SUPERB LIFERS OUT THERE) IT DOES NEED POINTING OUT THAT ONE OF THE PREVIOUS SUPERBS MOST ATTRACTIVE FEATURES HAS NOW BEEN REMOVED FROM THE NEW CAR. THE CLEVER DUAL BOOT SYSTEM WHEREBY WITH THE FLICK OF A LEVER, IT COULD BE TRANSFORMED FROM BEING A SALOON TO A HATCHBACK, IS SADLY NO MORE. SKODA CITES WEIGHT CONSIDERATIONS AND PACKAGING PRACTICALITY AS THE REASONS FOR THIS, BUT IT HAS TO BE SAID IT IS SOMETHING FANS WILL DEFINITELY MISS. WHAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO DO WITHOUT, HOWEVER, IS THE CORE CHARACTER OF THE SUPERB: MORE SPACE, COMFORT AND REFINEMENT THAN ITS RIVALS AT A PRICE THAT WILL ASTONISH FOR WHATS ON OFFER. THE NEW CAR IS LONGER (28MM), WIDER (47MM) AND TALLER (6MM) AND HAS A LONGER WHEELBASE (80MM) THAN PREVIOUSLY AND WHILE THE REAR LEGROOM HAS NOT INCREASED (FRANKLY, IF IT HAD ANY MORE IT WOULD BE A SHOO-IN FOR THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS TRANSPORT CONTRACT), EVERYTHING ELSE HAS HEAD ROOM, ELBOW ROOM, HIP ROOM AND WHATEVER ELSE YOURE HAVING. FLABBERGASTINGLY, THE BOOT HAS ALSO 30 LITRES MORE ACCOMMODATION SPACE UP NOW TO 626, INCREASING TO 1,760 WITH THE BACK SEATS DOWN. THAT IS A REMARKABLE 323 MORE THAN A FORD MONDEO, FOR EXAMPLE. THE ONLY CAR I KNOW OF WITH MORE ROOM IN THE BACK IS A HEARSE. I SWEAR, YOU COULD REASONABLY EXPECT TO FIT A SMALL EUROPEAN PRINCIPALITY INTO THAT BOOT. WORTH NOTING TOO IS THAT THE HATCH OPENS AUTOMATICALLY, EITHER BY USING THE BUTTON ON THE KEY FOB OR, AS WAS THE OPTION ON THE TESTER, BY WAVING YOUR FOOT UNDER THE REAR BUMPER. ALL OF THAT AND THE WEIGHT OF THE WHOLE PACKAGE HAS BEEN REDUCED BY 75 KILOS TOO AND THIS IMPACTS ON PERFORMANCE. NOW I KNOW THATS NOT NECESSARILY A WORD THAT COMES EASILY TO MIND WHEN YOU MENTION THE SUPERB, BUT THERE IS INCREASED FUEL ECONOMY AND PERFORMANCE ON OFFER HERE IN ALL ENGINE OPTIONS. THE ONE WE TRIED THE 190 BHP VERSION OF THE TWO LITRE TDI IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE THE MOST POPULAR CHOICE FOR IRISH BUYERS (THAT WILL FALL BETWEEN THE 1.6 120 BHP VERSION OR THE 150 BHP 2.0 LITRE OPTION OR EVEN THE 1.4 LITRE 125 BHP PETROL OPTION), BUT THERE IS STILL LITTLE TO DISLIKE ABOUT WHATS ON OFFER. IT WILL DO THE 0-100 KPH DASH IN JUST EIGHT SECONDS AND ACHIEVE A TOP SPEED OF 237 KPH, WHILE OFFERING A COMBINED CYCLE ECONOMY RETURN OF 4.1 L/100 KM (68.9 MPG) AND ANNUAL ROAD TAX OF 190. IT IS ALLIED TO AN EXCELLENT SIX SPEED GEARBOX WHICH ALLOWS CAR AND DRIVER TO MESH PRECISELY AND FIND PLENTY OF GRUNT WITHOUT HAVING TO EXPLORE THE OUTER REACHES OF THE PERFORMANCE ENVELOPE AND THUS IT IS A WELL TUNED, DRIVER-ORIENTED MACHINE WHICH WILL COVER VAST DISTANCES WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO BREAK SWEAT, OR RE-FUEL FOR THAT MATTER. IN STYLE SPECIFICATION LITTLE IS FOUND WANTING AND WHILE THE SPECIFICATION IS MASSIVE (LEATHER UPHOLSTERY, REVERSING CAMERA, ELECTRIC DRIVERS SEAT, CRUISE CONTROL, THREE ZONE CLIMATE CONTROL AND ALL THAT CONNECTIVITY STUFF TODAYS PUNTERS DEMAND), IT IS APPARENT TOO THAT ?SKODA HAS UPPED THE ANTE ON THE DCOR FRONT, WHAT WITH AMBIENT LIGHTING NOW COMING AS PART OF THE DEAL. IT MIGHT NOT QUITE BE UP TO, SAY, AUDI A6 STANDARDS, BUT IT IS NOT FAR OFF. AS A DRIVING COMPANION TOO, THE SUPERB IS NOW AN EVEN MORE ROUNDED PROSPECT THAN BEFORE AND I KNOW THAT FEW WILL QUIBBLE WITH WHAT WAS ON OFFER HERETOFORE. BUT THE RIDE AND HANDLING HAVE BEEN SCHMOOSED TO OFFER A MORE DYNAMIC EXPERIENCE. IT MIGHT BE A SMALL LEAP, BUT IT IS AN UPWARDS ONE NONETHELESS. SO, WHAT MORE CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS REMARKABLE MACHINE? I MEAN, WHOD HAVE THOUGHT ?SKODA WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEIR ALREADY RENOWNED MORE FOR LESS STANDARDS TO GREATER HEIGHTS? WELL THEY HAVE AND, JUDGING BY THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE CAR I WAS DRIVING, YOUD HAVE TO THINK THIS IS A NAILED-ON WINNER. IN FACT, I DONT JUST THINK IT. I KNOW IT. COLLEYS VERDICT SKODA SUPERB 2.0 TDI 190 BHP IN STYLE TRIM. FROM 26,795 - 38,905 AS TESTED. PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE THE MOST POPULAR CHOICE FOR IRISH BUYERS, BUT THE 190 BHP VERSION OF THE TWO LITRE TURBODIESEL IS STILL AN EXCELLENT OPTION. BASE LEVELS ARE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE, BUT THE STYLE TRIM IS HUGELY IMPRESSIVE. AND WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU GET TWO UMBRELLAS AS PART OF THE DEAL? THE GREAT GOT GREATER. IRISH EXAMINER LTD.

251	FROM A NOTORIOUS CON MAN TO CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES, THIS GRAND HOME -- NAY, THIS GRAND COMPOUND -- IN THE HEART OF THE LOS FELIZ NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES HAS HOUSED QUITE A CAST OF CHARACTERS OVER THE YEARS. WITH 14 BEDROOMS EIGHT BATHROOMS, IT'S RICH WITH HISTORY AND BRIMMING WITH POSSIBILITIES. BUILT IN 1929 BY ARCHITECT HARLEY S. BRADLEY FOR A MAN NAMED RUDOLPH ROSENBERG , IT WAS SOLD THE SAME YEAR TO MUSIC STORE MAGNATE PLATT . OVER THE YEARS, HIRED ARCHITECTS PAUL R. WILLIAMS AND ALBERT E. HANSEN , TO EXPAND IT, ADDING A POOL, TENNIS COURTS, AND ANOTHER STORY TO BRING IT TO ITS CURRENT 10,000-SQUARE-FOOT MEASUREMENT.  OLAF, UW-STEVENS POINT AND EDGEWOOD COLLEGE.  ONE OF THE GREAT EXPERIENCES OF THIS TRAINEESHIP HAS BEEN ENGAGING WITH THE ARCHIVE MATERIALS. THE NEXT OWNER WAS A NOTORIOUS CON MAN NAMED C.C. JULIAN , WHOM LISTING AGENT DAVID SOLOMON DESCRIBES AS THE BERNIE MADOFF OF HIS DAY. AFTER HIS COMPANY, THE JULIAN PETROLEUM CORP., WAS FOUND TO HAVE SWINDLED MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE OUT OF $150 MILLION, JULIAN COMMITTED SUICIDE (NOT IN THIS HOME) IN 1934. IN THE LATE 1950S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OWNER TOOK OVER: THE SAINT COLUMBAN'S FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY, A GROUP OF CATHOLIC MISSIONARY PRIESTS WHO STILL LIVE THERE TODAY. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES MADE TO THE HOME OVER THE YEARS (SPACES WERE DIVIDED TO CREATE ADDITIONAL ROOMS TO HOUSE PRIESTS), SOLOMON SAYS THE HOME RETAINS MANY OF ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES, INCLUDING CARVED FIREPLACES AND DETAILED WOODWORK. THE MOST NOTEWORTHY HISTORIC FEATURE IS A CAVE THAT LEADS TO A HIDDEN WINE CELLAR TO A FULL SPEAK-EASY USED DURING PROHIBITION. THERE ARE ALSO QUARTERS FOR LIVE-IN STAFF. SOLOMON SAYS IT WILL TAKE THE RIGHT BUYER TO BRING THE HOME TO PRESENT-DAY STANDARDS, BUT THE RETURN COULD BE HUGE.  FOR ME, IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A REAL BAND WITH A SCHEDULE AND MAKING RECORDS AND TOURING. CURRENTLY LISTED FOR $5,499,000, THE PROPERTY COULD BE VALUED AT OVER $12 MILLION POSTRENOVATION BASED ON ITS SIZE, HISTORY, AND LOCATION. "WHEN IT'S REDONE, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES IN LOS ANGELES," HE SAYS. ALTHOUGH THE HOME IS SET BACK FROM THE ROAD, IT FEATURES AMAZING CITY VIEWS AND IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HOLLYWOOD'S GREEK THEATRE AND GRIFFITH PARK. AS THE NEIGHBORS, THINK HOLLYWOOD STARS.  THE "TWILIGHT" STAR SOLD THE HOME IN 2014, AND NOW PARSONS OF "THE BIG BANG THEORY" LIVES THERE. SO WHO'LL BE NEXT TO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THIS HISTORIC HOME? SOLOMON SAYS WHILE IT COULD BE ANYONE FROM A SINGLE FAMILY TO A PRODUCTION COMPANY, THE LUCKY OWNER WILL DEFINITELY POSSESS ONE QUALITY. "THE RIGHT BUYER WILL BE SOMEONE WHO HAS AN APPRECIATION FOR THE TYPE OF HOME THEY JUST DON'T ANYMORE," HE SAID. "THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS."
252	THE VIEW IS TRYING TO GET BACK IN THE GOOD GRACES OF NURSES. AFTER THE CO-HOSTS' COMMENTS ABOUT NURSES ON MONDAY LED TO OUTRAGE AND THE EVENTUAL LOSS OF TWO MAJOR ADVERTISERS , THE ABC DAYTIME TALK SHOW RESPONDED ON FRIDAY WITH A SHOW BASICALLY DEVOTED TO CELEBRATING NURSING. WATCH: 'THE VIEW' LOSES ADVERTISERS OVER CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS ABOUT NURSES WHILE MISS COLORADO DEFENDS MONOLOGUE "WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT NURSES THIS WEEK," SAID CO-HOST JOY BEHAR. "AND TODAY THE VIEW IS GOING TO CELEBRATE NURSES!" "YOU LET US KNOW THAT YOU WERE OFFENDED BY SOME OF OUR COMMENTS AND, BELIEVE ME, WE WERE LISTENING," SHE CONTINUED. "WE APOLOGIZE FOR OUR REMARKS AND WE KNOW HOW VITALLY IMPORTANT NURSES ARE." THEN BEHAR INVITED OUT "THE DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS FROM NYU COLLEGE OF NURSING TO SHARE FIRSTHAND WHAT THESE HARDWORKING NURSES DO ON A DAILY BASIS." WATCH: 'THE VIEW' HOSTS APOLOGIZE OVER CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS MADE ABOUT NURSES WHILE THE HIGHLIGHTING OF THE HARD WORK NURSES DO IS CERTAINLY WELCOME, SOME ON TWITTER SUGGESTED THE SHOW'S EFFORTS WERE A LITTLE INSINCERE. ONE FAN WROTE , "COULD THE LOSS OF [JOHNSON&JOHNSON] HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?" THE BACKLASH STARTED WHEN THE CO-HOSTS WERE RECAPPING LAST SUNDAY'S MISS AMERICA PAGEANT, WHEN MISS COLORADO KELLEY JOHNSON OPTED TO GIVE A MONOLOGUE ABOUT BEING A NURSE FOR THE TALENT PORTION OF THE PROGRAM. SHE CAME OUT IN A NURSES UNIFORM AND BASICALLY READ HER EMAILS OUT LOUD AND SHOCKINGLY DID NOT WIN, CO-HOST MICHELLE COLLINS JOKED. I WAS LIKE, THATS NOT A REAL TALENT. WATCH: VANESSA WILLIAMS MAKES TRIUMPHANT, MUSICAL RETURN TO MISS AMERICA WHY DOES SHE HAVE A DOCTORS STETHOSCOPE ON?" CO-HOST JOY BEHAR ADDED. BY WEDNESDAY, JOHNSON & JOHNSON, AND EGGLAND'S BEST BOTH DECIDED TO PULL THEIR ADVERTISING FROM THE PROGRAM. "JOHNSON & JOHNSON VALUES AND APPRECIATES NURSES AND WE RESPECT THE CRITICAL ROLE THEY PLAY IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM," THE COMPANY SAID ON ITS FACEBOOK PAGE. "WE DISAGREE WITH RECENT COMMENTS ON DAYTIME TELEVISION ABOUT THE NURSING PROFESSION, AND WE HAVE PAUSED OUR ADVERTISING ACCORDINGLY." IN A STATEMENT, EGGLAND'S BEST WROTE: "EGGLANDS BEST APPRECIATES NURSES AND VALUES THE IMPORTANT ROLE THEY PLAY IN FAMILY HEALTH. IN LIGHT OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE NURSING PROFESSION RECENTLY MADE ON DAYTIME TELEVISION WE WILL NO LONGER BE ADVERTISING ON THE SHOW IN QUESTION." "MY TALENT IS TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE, AND CARING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE," JOHNSON SAID ON THE ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW ON WEDNESDAY. "I THOUGHT, 'YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GO UP THERE AND I WANT TO BE AUTHENTIC. I WANT TO BE KELLEY.'" "AND IF IM EVER GOING TO WIN MISS AMERICA, I WANT TO DO IT BEING MYSELF," SHE ADDED. "AND IM A NURSE!" WATCH: WHOOPI SAYS ROSIE O'DONNELL WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO 'THE VIEW' ON WEDNESDAY, THE VIEW HOSTS APOLOGIZED FOR THE CONTROVERSY. CO-HOST MICHELLE COLLINS SAID, "WE LOVE NURSES. WE ADORE YOU. WE RESPECT YOU. YOU GUYS ARE WONDERFUL. YOURE THE MOST COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE. I WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT NURSES, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TALENT COMPETITION, AND IT GOT MISCONSTRUED." BEHAR ADDED THAT SHE WAS "JUST NOT PAYING ATTENTION," SAYING, "I WAS LOOKING AT A MISS AMERICA TAPE, AND THERES A WOMAN WEARING AN OUTFIT WITH A STETHOSCOPE, AND IM THINKING IS SHE IN A COSTUME?" "I DIDNT KNOW SHE WAS A NURSE," SHE SAID. "IM USED TO SEEING THEM IN GOWNS AND BATHING SUITS." WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE VIEW' S ATTEMPTS TO MAKE AMENDS WITH NURSES? YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE MOST POPULAR
253	CLAUDE GIROUX, LEFT, AND WAYNE SIMMONDS FOUND THE FIRST DAY OF TRAINING CAMP TO BE MUCH HIGHER TEMPO THAN NORMAL. (PHOTO: ZACK HILL/PHILADELPHIA FLYERS) VOORHEES WHEN A REPETITION OF A DRILL WAS DONE, MOST PLAYERS GLIDED TO THE BLUELINE TO REST, HUNCHED OVER AND PROPPING THEMSELVES UP WITH THEIR STICKS OVER THEIR KNEES. THOSE FEW SECONDS WERE THE ONLY RELIEF ON THE ICE DURING THE FLYERS OPENING PRACTICE OF TRAINING CAMP. IT LOOKS LIKE ROOKIE COACH DAVE HAKSTOL WILL HAVE THE FLYERS MOVING A MILE A MINUTE IN PRACTICE, ALTHOUGH HE SAID THE CADENCE WASNT ALL BASED OFF OF HIS WHISTLE. THATS THE PLAYERS, HAKSTOL SAID. OUR WHOLE STAFF SENSED THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, GUYS COMING INTO TOWN, CHOMPING AT THE BIT. REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING OUT AND WORKING TOGETHER AND WORKS HARD TOGETHER AND THATS WHAT THEY DID TODAY. HAKSTOL COMES TO THE FLYERS AFTER 11 YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA. THATS A NORMAL PACE FOR AN NCAA PRACTICE. OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY PRODUCT R.J. UMBERGER HAD BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE. THERE WERE DEFINITELY SOME ASPECTS TO IT THE BATTLING, THE ONE HARD LAP AFTER A WHISTLE OR A DRILL, THE UP-AND-DOWN KIND OF A TEMPO, UMBERGER SAID. THATS A STANDARD, EARLY IN THE WEEK PRACTICE AFTER A DAY OFF OR WHATEVER TO GET THE TEMPO BACK INTO IT. IM SURE THAT HAS A BIG INFLUENCE AND AS THE SEASON GOES ON AND AS WE GO PRACTICES WILL BE A LOT DIFFERENT. WERE GOING TO BE TECHNICAL AND STUFF LIKE THAT. HAKSTOL SAID THE TEMPO OF FRIDAYS OPENING PRACTICE IS THE EXPECTATION MOVING FORWARD. THAT OPENED SOME EYES FOR SOME OF THE PLAYERS WHO WERENT USED TO THINGS MOVING SO QUICKLY. THAT WAS ONE OF THE TOP, FOR SURE, DEFENSEMAN RADKO GUDAS SAID. IT WAS GREAT TO GET BACK OUT THERE. UNDER COACH WE GOT OUR FIRST PRACTICE IN AND I THOUGHT EVERYONE WAS EXCITED. THE PRACTICE WENT REALLY WELL. THE FIRST SESSION WAS ALL VETERANS AND PLAYERS THAT HAVE THE BEST SHOT OF MAKING THE ROSTER ON OCT. 8 WHEN THE REGULAR SEASON BEGINS. THE SECOND SESSION WAS A LITTLE MORE SUBDUED, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE PLAYERS ALSO TOOK PART IN ROOKIE CAMP MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THAT PRACTICE ENDED IN A FULL SCRIMMAGE. IN TERMS OF THE LINE COMBINATIONS, IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT THE FLYERS STARTED WITH FRIDAY IS SOMETHING THEYLL CONTINUE TO EXPERIMENT WITH AND IT LOOKED QUITE SIMILAR TO LAST SEASON. MICHAEL RAFFL, CLAUDE GIROUX AND JAKE VORACEK ANCHORED THE TOP LINE. MATT READ, SEAN COUTURIER AND WAYNE SIMMONDS WERE ANOTHER FAMILIAR TRIO, AS WERE CHRIS VANDEVELDE, PIERRE-EDOUARD BELLEMARE AND RYAN WHITE. UMBERGER PLAYED THE LEFT SIDE ON A LINE WITH VINNY LECAVALIER BACK AT CENTER (HE PLAYED MOSTLY RIGHT WING LAST SEASON) AND NEWCOMER SAM GAGNER. NORTH DAKOTA ALUM CHRIS PORTER WAS ON A LINE CENTERED BY SCOTT LAUGHTON WITH BRAYDEN SCHENN ON THE RIGHT WING. WE JUST PUT THE LINES TOGETHER THE WAY WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE FOR SUCCESS, HAKSTOL SAID. I DONT THINK THERE WAS ANY EXTRA THOUGHT GOING INTO IT IN THAT REGARD. WE PUT GROUPS TOGETHER. WERE LOOKING FOR FOUR GROUPS OF FORWARDS THAT CAN HELP US WIN GAMES. THATS THE AIM FOR ALL OF IT: THE HIGH PACE, THE NEW COACH, NEW PLAYERS AND THE FAST-PACED START TO TRAINING CAMP. TWICE IN THE LAST THREE SEASONS THE FLYERS HAVE MISSED THE PLAYOFFS AND THEY THINK THATS MORE A PRODUCT OF UNDERACHIEVEMENT THAN LACK OF TALENT. I ENDED UP READING AN ARTICLE AND SEEING HOW WERE DOWN IN THE STANDINGS, CAPTAIN CLAUDE GIROUX SAID. IT KINDA PISSES ME OFF A LITTLE BIT AND PUT SOME MOTIVATION IN US. WE THINK WERE A PLAYOFF TEAM. THERES ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT AND THATS TO BE IN THE PLAYOFFS. BEFORE THEY CAN REACH THE PLAYOFFS, LET ALONE REGULAR-SEASON GAMES, THEYVE GOT TO GET THROUGH SOME TOUGH PRACTICES. I WAS THE ONE HUNCHED DOWN, GIROUX ADMITTED. AT THE END A COUPLE DRILLS WERE KIND OF HARD, BUT THE HARD WORK IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW SO WE WONT HAVE TO WORK AS HARD DURING GAMES.

EVEN WHEN THE PAST IS STARING AT HER AS SPECTATOR AND FORMER RIVAL M VENUS WILLIAMS DOESNT ENJOY TRIPS DOWN MEMORY LANE, AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE VIEW MAY BE. EVEN WHEN THE PAST IS STARING AT HER AS SPECTATOR AND FORMER RIVAL MARTINA HINGIS WAS DURING WILLIAMS THIRD ROUND U.S. OPEN MATCH FRIDAY THE 35-YEAR-OLD PREFERS TO LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD; LESS INTERESTED IN REVISITING HER 1997 FINALS RUN AS A DEBUTING, UNSEEDED TEENAGER WITH RED, WHITE AND BLUE BRAIDS AS DISCUSSING THE OPPONENT IN FRONT OF HER. THAT OPPONENT WAS ANOTHER SWISS STAR, 12TH-SEEDED BELINDA BENCIC, WHO WAS BORN THE SAME YEAR WILLIAMS FIRST APPEARED IN FLUSHING, AND WHO THREE WEEKS AGO BECAME JUST THE SECOND PERSON TO BEAT WILLIAMS SISTER, SERENA, THIS YEAR. ENTERING THE MATCH HAVING LOST A SET IN EACH OF THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS, THE 23RD-SEEDED WILLIAMS PUT ON AN IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE OVER THE TEENAGE THREAT, USING A SERVE STRAIGHT OUT OF HER PRIME TO DEFEAT BENCIC, 6-3, 6-4 AT ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM. AFTER ADVANCING TO THE TOURNAMENTS FOURTH ROUND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE YEARS, WILLIAMS MENTIONED SHE RECEIVED SOME ADVICE FOR THE MATCH FROM A CERTAIN TOP-RANKED PLAYER IN THE WORLD, WHO RECENTLY PLAYED BENCIC. YES, BUT THATS BETWEEN US, WILLIAMS SAID WITH A SMILE. I THINK IT WORKED. WILLIAMS, WHO OVERCAME A 4-1 DEFICIT IN THE SECOND SET TO THE SECOND-HIGHEST SEED LEFT IN THE TOP HALF OF THE DRAW, NEXT WILL PLAY 19-YEAR-OLD QUALIFIER ANETT KONTAVEIT, WHO IS RANKED NO. 152 IN THE WORLD AND HAD NEVER WON A GRAND SLAM MATCH BEFORE THIS WEEK. WITH ONE MORE WIN, WILLIAMS WILL BE IN POSITION FOR A POTENTIAL SHOWDOWN WITH HER TOP-SEEDED SISTER IN THE QUARTERFINALS. DESPITE BEING FAR TOO EXPERIENCED TO LOOK TOO FAR AHEAD, WILLIAMS ADMITTED THE LOOMING BATTLE IN WHICH SERENAS PURSUIT OF A CALENDAR GRAND SLAM WOULD BE AT STAKE HAS CROSSED HER MIND. HOW COULD IT NOT? AS MUCH AS SHES TRIED TO MAKE THEIR PREVIOUS 26, OFTEN AWKWARD PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS (15-11, SERENA) FEEL LIKE ANY OTHER MATCH, WILLIAMS HAS TO CONSIDER MUCH MORE THAN JUST FACING THE WORLDS BEST PLAYER. OF COURSE I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND I WOULD LIKE US TO HAVE THAT MOMENT SO WE CAN SEE HOW IT IS, SAID WILLIAMS, WHO NOW RANKS SECOND IN U.S. OPEN MATCH WINS, BEHIND HER SISTER. WE BOTH HAVE TO GET THERE. I THINK WE BOTH HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, BUT THERE ARE NO GIVENS. [OUR] FIRST MATCH WAS P

THE ROYAL WAS ADDED TO THE SHOW'S TITLE IN 2013, THE YEAR THE GLOUCESTERSHIRE-BASED PRINCESS ROYAL BECAME THE SHOW'S PATRON. SHE HAS BEEN A FREQUENT VISITOR OVER THE YEARS. THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE THREE COUNTIES AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY, KEN NOTTAGE, WAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF GLOUCESTER RUGBY IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TAKING UP HIS CURRENT POST. ALL OF THOSE ASSOCIATIONS POINT TO A CLOSE AFFINITY BETWEEN GLOUCESTERSHIRE AND THE THREE COUNTIES SHOWGROUND, WHICH IS UNDERLINED BY THEIR PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER. THE SHOWGROUND IS ONLY AROUND HALF AN HOUR FROM CHELTENHAM AND IT IS WITHIN EASY REACH OF A VARIETY OF STARTING DESTINATIONS. ITS CENTRAL LOCATION MEANS IT IS 15 MINUTES FROM THE M5'S JUNCTIONS 7 AND 8 AND THE M50'S JUNCTION 1. IT IS ONLY A FIVE-MINUTE DRIVE FROM GREAT MALVERN STATION, WHICH HAS DIRECT TRAINS TO AND FROM LONDON PADDINGTON (THREE HOURS) AND BIRMINGHAM NEW STREET (ONE HOUR). A SHUTTLE BUS IS AVAILABLE FROM THE STATION ON REQUEST. BIRMINGHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IS JUST 50 MINUTES AWAY AND BRISTOL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 90 MINUTES. FOR ANYONE DRIVING TO AN EVENT AT THE SHOWGROUND THERE IS THE ADDED BONUS OF FREE PARKING. THAT ALL MAKES THE THREE COUNTIES CENTRE A GOOD CHOICE FOR GLOUCESTERSHIRE BUSINESSES LOOKING FOR A DISTINCTIVE, NEARBY VENUE TO STAGE EVENTS. ONE, STAVERTON-BASED CREED FOODSERVICE, HAS SELECTED IT FOR ITS CREED FOODSERVICE TRADE SHOW. ONE OF THE ATTRACTIONS OF THE SHOWGROUND FOR CREED WAS ITS HISTORY IN AGRICULTURE AND FOOD BUT, IN THE WORDS OF CREED FOODSERVICE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, CHRIS CREED: "IT'S NOT THAT FAR". "THIS IS A REALLY SPECIAL SPACE AND WHILST WE ARE LOCATED IN AN AREA OF OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY, SOME SERIOUS BUSINESS IS DONE HERE. "PERHAPS, HOWEVER, SOME PEOPLE DO NOT REALISE THE EXTENT OF OUR FACILITIES AND THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE FOR HIRE YEAR ROUND. "WE WOULD WELCOME YOU TO GET IN TOUCH AND COME FOR A TOUR." KEN NOTTAGE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, THREE COUNTIES AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY "WE CHOSE THE THREE COUNTIES FOR THE CREED ANNUAL TRADE SHOW 2015 BECAUSE THE FACILITIES WERE JUST WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF EXHIBITION SPACE, AVAILABILITY OF AN INDUSTRIAL KITCHEN AND EASE OF ACCESS. "THE THREE COUNTIES TEAM HAVE BEEN FRIENDLY AND PROFESSIONAL AND ALL IN ALL IT'S A GREAT SETTING". CHRIS CREED, CEO, CREED FOODSERVICE "I'VE BEEN TO A NUMBER OF EVENTS AT THREE COUNTIES AND WAS A SPEAKER AT THE THREE COUNTIES BIG BREAKFAST, WHICH WAS PACKED WITH LOCAL BUSINESS PEOPLE. "IT'S A VERSATILE VENUE THAT IS WITHIN EASY STRIKING DISTANCE OF CHELTENHAM AND, OF COURSE, THE SETTING WITH THE VIEWS OF THE MALVERN HILLS IS UNPARALLELED." JANE FURZE, DIRECTOR, CHELTENHAM LITERATURE FESTIVAL "WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON OUR HIGH LEVELS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. "WHETHER YOU HAVE BOOKED A SMALL CONFERENCE FOR 30 PEOPLE OR A LARGE EXHIBITION FOR 2,000, YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND OUR EVENTS TEAM TO BE PROFESSIONAL, FRIENDLY AND HAPPY TO HELP. "I PERSONALLY HAVE 10 YEARS' EXPERIENCE IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY LOCALLY SO I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY CLIENT HAS DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND I ENJOY TAILOR MAKING PACKAGES TO SUIT." CLAIRE JARRETT, VENUE HIRE CO-ORDINATOR, THREE COUNTIES

259	SEPT. 06-- IF A SALESMAN COMES TO YOUR DOOR AND SAYS HE'S THERE TO ALERT YOU THAT YOUR CURRENT ALARM COMPANY HAS GONE UNDER OR WAS BOUGHT OUT BY HIS COMPANY, DON'T BUY IT. THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE RECENTLY INVESTIGATED CLAIMS THAT VISION SECURITY OF UTAH WAS MISLEADING HOMEOWNERS IN AN ATTEMPT TO LINE UP NEW BUSINESS. VISION SECURITY DENIED ANY WRONGDOING BUT SETTLED THE CASE RECENTLY BY AGREEING TO PAY A $30,000 FINE AND $5,000 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S PUBLIC PROTECTION AND EDUCATION FUND. IT ALSO AGREED TO ENSURE ITS SALES STAFF IDENTIFIES ITSELF, USES CLEAR CONTRACTS AND DOESN'T MISLEAD CUSTOMERS. VISION SECURITY DID NOT RETURN MY CALL. IN THE SETTLEMENT, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ALLEGED VISION SECURITY VIOLATED THE STATE'S CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW BY COMMITTING "UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES" AND/OR ENGAGING IN "UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION." SALES REPRESENTATIVES "MISREPRESENTED" TO HOMEOWNERS THAT THEIR CURRENT HOME SECURITY SYSTEM PROVIDER WAS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS OR WAS SOLD TO VISION SECURITY; THAT THEY WERE AFFILIATED WITH THE HOMEOWNER'S CURRENT ALARM COMPANY; THAT THE PURPOSE OF THEIR VISIT WAS TO UPGRADE THE CURRENT SECURITY SYSTEM; AND THAT IF THEY SWITCHED SYSTEMS, VISION SECURITY WOULD PAY ANY CANCELLATION FEE, THE SETTLEMENT ALLEGES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SAID VISION SECURITY COOPERATED WITH THE INVESTIGATION AND RESOLVED CUSTOMERS' COMPLAINTS BY CANCELING CONTRACTS. NO CUSTOMERS FROM LEHIGH OR NORTHAMPTON COUNTIES FILED COMPLAINTS, BUT IF ANYONE LOCALLY WAS HIT BY THIS, THERE'S STILL TIME TO SEEK JUSTICE. HOMEOWNERS WHO WERE MISLED INTO SIGNING UP WITH VISION SECURITY AND PAID EARLY TERMINATION FEES TO THEIR PREVIOUS ALARM COMPANY CAN SEEK REFUNDS OF THOSE FEES BY FILING A COMPLAINT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE BY OCT. 9. THE SETTLEMENT ALLOWS PENNSYLVANIA CUSTOMERS WHO SIGNED CONTRACTS WITH VISION SECURITY ON OR AFTER JAN. 1, 2014, TO CANCEL THEIR CONTRACTS AT NO COST. VISION SECURITY IS USED TO INVESTIGATORS ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS SALES PRACTICES. ACCORDING TO ITS BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU REPORT, THE COMPANY HAS SETTLED PROBES BY CONSUMER PROTECTION OFFICES IN OHIO, IDAHO AND FLORIDA IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. IN APRIL, UTAH AUTHORITIES ACCUSED VISION SECURITY OF ENGAGING IN UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND SUSPENDED ITS LICENSE FOR THREE YEARS, ACCORDING TO THE BBB. SUCH ACCUSATIONS AREN'T LIMITED TO THIS COMPANY, THOUGH. A FEW YEARS AGO, A 78-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM ALLENTOWN TOLD ME HE WAS DUPED BY A DECEPTIVE SALES VISIT FROM ANOTHER SECURITY FIRM. HE SAID HE WAS TOLD HIS ALARM COMPANY HAD CLOSED, PROMPTING HIM TO BUY SERVICE FROM THE SALESMAN, A FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT AT A COST OF $2,400. ONLY LATER, WHEN HIS PREVIOUS ALARM COMPANY CONTINUED TAKING AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS FROM HIS BANK ACCOUNT, DID HE REALIZE IT STILL WAS IN BUSINESS AND HE'D BEEN GIVEN THE BUSINESS BY AN UNDERHANDED SALESMAN. HE STOPPED PAYING THE NEW COMPANY AFTER DISCOVERING HE'D BEEN DUPED, AND IT TOLD HIM IT REPORTED HIM TO THE CREDIT BUREAU. I HELPED HIM STRAIGHTEN IT OUT BY CALLING THE NEW MONITORING SERVICE, WHICH AGREED TO CANCEL THE ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SOLD UNDER FALSE PRETENSES. LAST WEEK, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN MISSOURI REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH ANOTHER UTAH ALARM COMPANY, VIVINT, IN A PROBE INTO ITS SALES PRACTICES. VIVINT, FORMERLY KNOWN AS APX ALARM SECURITY SOLUTIONS, AGREED TO PAY $50,000 IN RESTITUTION TO 50 MISSOURI CONSUMERS WHO WERE "HARMED BY THE COMPANY'S DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES," PLUS $15,000 IN FINES, ACCORDING TO A NEWS RELEASE FROM THE MISSOURI ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. CUSTOMERS HAD ALLEGED VIVINT'S DOOR-TO-DOOR SALES PEOPLE MISREPRESENTED THE COMPANY THEY WORKED FOR AND EXAGGERATED LOCAL CRIME RATES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID VIVINT HAD A POLICY OF AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDING CONSUMERS' CONTRACTS FOR A YEAR FOLLOWING THE EXPIRATION OF THE INITIAL CONTRACT TERM. THOSE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT HAVE HIT LOCALLY, TOO. I'VE WRITTEN BEFORE ABOUT ALARM COMPANIES TRYING TO SELL SYSTEMS BY SCARING PEOPLE WITH PHONE CALLS SUPPOSEDLY FROM THE FBI, OR CITING THE FBI, ABOUT CRIME IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. AND AUTO-RENEWING CONTRACTS ALWAYS ARE A CONCERN. MAKE SURE TO READ YOUR TERMS BECAUSE SOME CONTRACTS HAVE CLAUSES THAT LOCK YOU IN AUTOMATICALLY FOR A SERIES OF RENEWALS IF YOU DON'T OPT OUT BY A CERTAIN POINT. IF AN ALARM SALESMAN APPROACHES YOU WITH A STORY ABOUT YOUR ALARM COMPANY CLOSING OR SELLING OUT, DON'T BELIEVE IT. CALL YOUR PROVIDER TO CHECK IT OUT. AS WITH ANY UNSOLICITED SALES CALL, EITHER IN-PERSON OR ON THE PHONE, DON'T MAKE AN IMMEDIATE DECISION. RESEARCH THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE FIRST BY CHECKING OUT ITS REPUTATION ONLINE AND CONSULTING RESOURCES SUCH AS THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU. THE WATCHDOG IS PUBLISHED THURSDAYS AND SUNDAYS.

261	FROM A NOTORIOUS CON MAN TO CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES, THIS GRAND HOME -- NAY, THIS GRAND COMPOUND -- IN THE HEART OF THE LOS FELIZ NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES HAS HOUSED QUITE A CAST OF CHARACTERS OVER THE YEARS.  I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PENALTIES, SO I WAS READY FOR THAT. WITH 14 BEDROOMS AND EIGHT BATHROOMS, IT'S RICH WITH HISTORY AND BRIMMING WITH POSSIBILITIES. BUILT IN 1929 BY ARCHITECT HARLEY S. BRADLEY FOR A MAN NAMED RUDOLPH ROSENBERG , IT WAS SOLD THE SAME YEAR TO MUSIC STORE MAGNATE BEN PLATT . OVER THE YEARS, PLATT HIRED ARCHITECTS PAUL R. WILLIAMS AND ALBERT E. HANSEN , TO EXPAND IT, ADDING A POOL, TENNIS COURTS, AND ANOTHER STORY TO BRING IT TO ITS CURRENT 10,000-SQUARE-FOOT MEASUREMENT.  IT ALLOWS ANY CUSTOMER OF COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL PLANNING AND FINANCIAL WISDOM BETWEEN 2003 AND 2012 TO HAVE THEIR FILES REVIEWED. THE NEXT OWNER WAS A NOTORIOUS CON MAN NAMED C.C. JULIAN , WHOM LISTING AGENT DAVID SOLOMON DESCRIBES AS THE BERNIE MADOFF OF HIS DAY.  HAD HE WON, ALMIROLA WOULD'VE AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFIED. AFTER HIS COMPANY, THE JULIAN PETROLEUM CORP., WAS FOUND TO HAVE SWINDLED MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE OUT OF $150 MILLION, JULIAN COMMITTED SUICIDE (NOT IN THIS HOME) IN 1934. IN THE LATE 1950S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OWNER TOOK OVER: THE SAINT COLUMBAN'S FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY, A GROUP OF CATHOLIC MISSIONARY PRIESTS WHO STILL LIVE THERE TODAY. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES MADE TO THE HOME OVER THE YEARS (SPACES WERE DIVIDED TO CREATE ADDITIONAL ROOMS TO HOUSE PRIESTS), SOLOMON SAYS THE HOME RETAINS MANY OF ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES, INCLUDING CARVED FIREPLACES AND DETAILED WOODWORK. THE MOST NOTEWORTHY HISTORIC FEATURE IS A CAVE THAT LEADS TO A HIDDEN WINE CELLAR TO A FULL SPEAK-EASY USED DURING PROHIBITION. THERE ARE ALSO QUARTERS FOR LIVE-IN STAFF. SOLOMON SAYS IT WILL TAKE THE RIGHT BUYER TO BRING THE HOME TO PRESENT-DAY STANDARDS, BUT THE RETURN COULD BE HUGE.  "WHEN IT'S REDONE, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES IN LOS ANGELES," HE SAYS.  BUT IF I WERE HIM, I WOULD BE THINKING OF HOW TO CORRECT THE GRAVE MISTAKE THE PARTY MADE IN TAMALE. ALTHOUGH THE HOME IS SET BACK FROM THE ROAD, IT FEATURES AMAZING CITY VIEWS AND IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HOLLYWOOD'S GREEK THEATRE AND GRIFFITH PARK. AS FOR THE NEIGHBORS, THINK HOLLYWOOD STARS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOME BEHIND THIS PROPERTY USED TO BE ROBERT PATTINSON 'S LOVE NEST WITH THEN-GIRLFRIEND KRISTEN STEWART . THE "TWILIGHT" STAR SOLD THE HOME IN 2014, AND NOW JIM PARSONS OF "THE BIG BANG THEORY" LIVES THERE. SO WHO'LL BE NEXT TO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THIS HISTORIC HOME? SOLOMON SAYS WHILE IT COULD BE ANYONE FROM A SINGLE FAMILY TO A PRODUCTION COMPANY, THE LUCKY OWNER WILL DEFINITELY POSSESS ONE QUALITY. "THE RIGHT BUYER WILL BE SOMEONE WHO HAS AN APPRECIATION FOR THE TYPE OF HOME THEY JUST DON'T BUILD ANYMORE," HE SAID. "THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS."
262	VOA - NEWS MONDAY 28TH SEPTEMBER, 2015 KENYAN PRESIDENT UHURU KENYATTA SAYS EAST AFRICAN NATIONS THAT HAVE WORKED TO BRING A NEW PEACE AGREEMENT FOR SOUTH SUDAN SHOULD EXPAND THEIR EFFORTS TO INCLUDE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN IMPLEMENTING THE PACT TO END 20 MONTHS OF FIGHTING. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH VOA'S AFRICA 54 IN NEW YORK, KENYATTA SAID THAT PATH WILL ALLOW THE OPENING OF HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS IN SOUTH SUDAN, WHERE THE CONFLICT HAS FORCED 2 MILLION PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES. IT WILL ALSO HELP IN ESTABLISHING AN AGREED UPON UNITY GOVERNMENT BETWEEN THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION AND REBELS. "I THINK THE KEY FOCUS NOW IS ACTUALLY ON IMPLEMENTATION, AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT ALL PARTIES HAVE SIGNED, I BELIEVE THERE IS A KEEN COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF ALL SOUTH SUDANESE PARTIES TO SEE A GENUINE PEACE ACHIEVED," KENYATTA SAID. "AND WHAT THEY NEED FROM US IS REALLY THE BACKING TO SEE THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH." KENYATTA EXPRESSED THE NEED TO INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT AND REBELS IN THE PROCESS, BUT ALSO TO BRING IN CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATION, CHURCHES AND THE COMMUNITIES OF SOUTH SUDAN. THE PEACE DEAL AGREED TO LAST MONTH CALLS FOR DEMILITARIZING THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL, JUBA, FORMING A TRANSITIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT WITHIN 90 DAYS AND GIVING REBELS THE POSITION OF VICE PRESIDENT. SINCE THE SIGNING, BOTH SIDES HAVE VIOLATED A CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT. IMPLEMENTING THE PEACE DEAL WILL BE THE FOCUS OF A MEETING TUESDAY ON THE SIDELINES OF THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN NEW YORK. THE TALKS WILL INCLUDE U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL BAN KI-MOON, AFRICAN UNION CHAIR NKOSAZANA DLAMINI ZUMA AND THE REGIONAL BODY IGAD THAT HELPED MEDIATE THE AGREEMENT. SOUTH SUDAN PRESIDENT SALVA KIIR IS SENDING VICE PRESIDENT JAMES WANI IGGA TO REPRESENT THE GOVERNMENT; IT IS NOT CLEAR IF REBEL LEADER AND FORMER VICE PRESIDENT RIEK MACHAR WILL PARTICIPATE. IN ADDITION TO THE SITUATION IN SOUTH SUDAN, KENYATTA TOLD AFRICA 54 THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS "GREATLY INCREASING" INVESTMENT IN SECURITY AFTER WHAT HE SAID WAS YEARS OF NOT SPENDING ENOUGH RESOURCES IN THAT SECTOR. HE SAID THE ISSUE IS NOT ONE THAT IS UNIQUE TO KENYA AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO "DENY SOME OF THESE EXTREMISTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A PULL FOR THESE TERRORISTS." "AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THIS THREAT OF TERRORISM IS NOT A THREAT TO KENYA, IT'S A THREAT TO THE WORLD, AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DEFEAT IT," HE SAID. KENYATTA ALSO DISCUSSED THE SCHEDULED NOVEMBER VISIT OF POPE FRANCIS, CALLING IT A "SIGNIFICANT MOMENT FOR KENYA." "WE ARE VERY EXCITED, BESIDE THE FACT THAT I'M A CATHOLIC, BUT I THINK HE IS REACHING OUT TO ALL RELIGIONS AND REACHING OUT TO ALL PEOPLE, AND HE HAS A VERY HUMANE MESSAGE THAT HE IS SENDING WHICH I THINK IS VERY APPROPRIATE NOT JUST FOR KENYA, BUT FOR THE WORLD TODAY," KENYATTA SAID.

ITS ONE CUSTOMER AT A TIME, GARRETT SAID. NO BELLS AND WHISTLES. GARRETT IS CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF HER STORE, DIANES BOOKS, THIS YEAR. ITS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR THE CANADA NATIVE WHO WAS SHOCKED WHEN SHE REALIZED THERE WAS NO CHILDRENS BOOK STORE IN TOWN WHEN SHE MOVED TO GREENWICH THREE DECADES AGO. I COULDNT BELIEVE THAT IN THIS FABULOUS TOWN THERE WAS NO CHILDRENS BOOKSTORE, GARRETT SAID. THERE WERE OTHER BOOKSTORES BUT NONE FOR CHILDREN AND I BELIEVE IF WHOLE FAMILIES DONT READ WE DONT RAISE READERS, SO I KNEW THERE WAS A VOID IN TOWN. GARRETT, WHO HAS A MASTERS IN LIBRARY SCIENCE, SAID SHE WAS TOLD MORE THAN ONCE SHE WAS CRAZY FOR WANTING TO OPEN A BOOKSTORE, BUT SHE HAD A PLAN FOR THE FAMILY BOOKSTORE AND WASNT ABOUT TO GIVE UP. SHE OPENED THE STORE ON GRIGG STREET, JUST OFF GREENWICH AVENUE, ON NOV. 3. SHE WANTED THE STORE TO BE A SPECIAL PLACE FOR CUSTOMERS TO CELEBRATE BOOKS, AND SHE WANTED EVERYONE IN HER STORE TO BE AN EXPERT IN SOME WAY IN ORDER TO HELP PEOPLE FIND THE PERFECT BOOK. THE FOUR CS COMPASSION, CURIOSITY, COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ARE THE RULES BY WHICH SHE RUNS HER BUSINESS, GARRETT SAID. EARLIER THIS YEAR, DIANE WAS AWARDED THE MALCOLM S. PRAY EXCELLENCE IN BUSINESS AWARD BY THE GREENWICH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE . THE TWO YEAR OLD AWARD IS GIVEN TO BUSINESS OWNERS WHO DO A LOT OF COMMUNITY SERVICE. WINNING THE AWARD, GARRETT SAID, WAS A GREAT WAY TO KICK OFF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION. THE TIMING WAS GREAT, GARRETT SAID. ITS A GREAT THING TO BE HERE 25 YEARS AND STILL BE HAVING SO MUCH FUN, AND THE BOOKS JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER. JEANNIE GILLESPIE HAS WORKED FOR GARRETT FOR 10 YEARS AND SAID GARRETTS EXPERTISE AND PASSION ARE WHAT MAKES THE STORE SUCCESSFUL AND A GREAT PLACE TO WORK. SHES A TOWN TREASURE, GILLESPIE SAID. SHE REALLY ADDS THAT PERSONAL TOUCH AND PEOPLE TRUST HER OPINION. I WORKED ON THE PUBLISHING SIDE AND BOOKSTORES ARE PART OF THE PUBLISHING ECOSYSTEM. DIANE IS PRETTY SPECIAL TO BE A PART OF THAT. KRISTIN MURPHY , 24, HAS BEEN A LOYAL DIANES BOOKS CUSTOMER THROUGHOUT HER LIFE. EVEN THOUGH SHES GONE OFF TO COLLEGE AND HAS MOVED TO RHODE ISLAND, SHE STILL MAKES A POINT TO STOP IN THE STORE ANYTIME SHES BACK IN GREENWICH. SHE SAID SHE PLANS TO COME BACK TO GREENWICH TO VISIT FOR THE WEEKEND OF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION. I HAVE A VERY DISTINCT MEMORY OF BUYING FERDINAND THE BULL AT DIANES AND TAKING IT TO MY FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN, MURPHY SAID. ITS JUST A REALLY SPECIAL PLACE, ESPECIALLY THE CHILDRENS SECTION. I STILL GO TO DIANES FOR RECOMMENDATIONS AND TO VISIT WHENEVER IM IN TOWN. THE STAFF IS JUST AMAZING. ITS A MAGICAL PLACE. OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS, DIANES BOOKS HAS EXPANDED FOUR TIMES AS THE BOOK BUSINESS HAS EVOLVED AND THE PUBLISHING WORLD HAS CONTINUED PUTTING OUT MORE AND MORE BOOKS. GARRETT SAID THE STORE USED TO HOST READINGS BUT DUE TO THE EXPANDED INVENTORY THEY SIMPLY DONT HAVE THE SPACE ANYMORE AND THE READINGS ARE HOSTED ELSEWHERE. BUT THE MEMORIES OF THOSE EARLY READINGS ARE CONTAINED IN THE WALLS OF DIANES WHERE SHE HAD VISITING AUTHORS SIGN THEIR NAME. GARRETT AND HER STAFF AT DIANES BOOKS WHO SHE REFERS TO AS DIANES DAZZLING DIVAS WILL CELEBRATE THE LANDMARK ANNIVERSARY ON HALLOWEEN, AS THEY HAVE FOR THEIR 15TH AND 20TH ANNIVERSARIES. THEY HAVE PLANS TO DRESS UP AND INVITE THE COMMUNITY TO CELEBRATE WITH THEM. THERE WILL BE A PARTY WITH FACE PAINTING AND RAFFLES, AND OF COURSE, GEARED TOWARD THE KIDS FOR WHOM SHE STARTED IT ALL. SURVIVING 25 YEARS JUST OFF THE EVER-CHANGING GREENWICH AVENUE IS NO SMALL FEAT FOR A SMALL BUSINESS, BUT GARRETT SAID SHE HAS NO PLANS TO MOVE THE STORE OR RETIRE ANYTIME SOON. I PLAN TO BE HERE UNTIL I CANT ANYMORE, GARRETT SAID. I JUST LOVE WHAT I DO. KKRASSELT@SCNI.COM; 203-625-4411; TWITTER: @KAITLYNKRASSELT
264	NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OFFSPRING. FOR EXAMPLE, BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS. DATE: SEPTEMBER 22, 2015 SOURCE: ELIFE SUMMARY: NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OFFSPRING. FOR EXAMPLE, BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS. SHARE: A NEW STUDY CARRIED OUT WITH BURYING BEETLES ALSO SHOWS THAT BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS. THE RESEARCH WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL ELIFE. "PARENTS OBVIOUSLY PLAY A HUGE ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR OFFSPRING," SAYS LEAD RESEARCHER PROFESSOR REBECCA KILNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. "THE AIM OF OUR STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE NON-GENETIC WAYS THAT PARENTS ACHIEVE THIS." THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE COULD SPEED UP THE RATE AT WHICH ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR EVOLVES AND ADAPTS IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD. WHETHER EXAMINING MOTHERS OR FATHERS, THE RESEARCH TEAM FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT RECEIVED NO CARE AS LARVAE WERE LESS EFFECTIVE AT RAISING A LARGE BROOD AS PARENTS, AND DIED YOUNGER. IN CONTRAST, HIGH QUALITY CARE NOT ONLY PRODUCES A LARGER BROOD, BUT INDIVIDUAL OFFSPRING WITH A HIGHER MASS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES. "WE FOUND THAT PARENTAL CARE PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE. GOOD QUALITY PARENTS PRODUCE OFFSPRING THAT BECOME GOOD PARENTS THEMSELVES, WHILE OFFSPRING THAT RECEIVE POOR PARENTING THEN BECOME LOW QUALITY PARENTS. OUR EXPERIMENTS SHOW HOW PARENTAL CARE ALLOWS OFFSPRING TO INHERIT CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR PARENTS, BUT NON-GENETICALLY," SHE SAYS. HOWEVER, THE TEAM ALSO FOUND THAT OFFSPRING PAY A COST FOR RECEIVING HIGH QUALITY CARE, BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION IF THEY PAIR UP WITH A LOWER QUALITY PARTNER. THIS MAY EXPLAIN WHY ANIMALS OFTEN CHOOSE A MATE THAT IS WILLING TO PUT IN A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF EFFORT AS THEM AS A PARENT. IN THIS WAY, THEY ARE LESS VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION. THE BURYING BEETLE, NICROPHORUS VESPILLOIDES, USES THE CARCASS OF A SMALL VERTEBRATE SUCH AS A MOUSE AS AN EDIBLE NEST FOR ITS YOUNG. AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS, A BREEDING PAIR BURIES THE CARCASS AND PRESERVES IT WITH AN ANTIBACTERIAL SECRETION. THE MOTHER LAYS EGGS NEARBY IN THE SOIL, AND THE LARVAE CRAWL TO THE CARCASS WHEN THEY HATCH. ALTHOUGH THE LARVAE CAN FEED THEMSELVES, THEY ALSO BEG BOTH PARENTS FOR PARTLY-DIGESTED FOOD FROM THE CARCASS. IN THE CURRENT STUDY, WHEN MALES WERE PAIRED WITH FEMALES THAT HAD RECEIVED NO POST-HATCHING CARE AS LARVAE, THEY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER LIVES THAN THOSE WHOSE PARTNERS HAD RECEIVED MORE CARE. THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT MALES WITH LOW QUALITY PARTNERS PUT MORE EFFORT INTO PARENTAL DUTIES TO COMPENSATE FOR THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THEIR MATE, AND PAID THE PRICE BY DYING YOUNGER.

265	SINGERS NICKI MINAJ AND MILEY CYRUS HAD A PUBLIC SPAT AT THE 2015 VMAS, HOSTED BY MILEY. DURING THE LIVE BROADCAST ON SUNDAY, NICKI CALLED MILEY A "BITCH" FOR TALKING ABOUT HER IN THE PRESS. ACCORDING TO AN INSIDER, "NICKI WAS LIVID WITH MILEY AND DECIDED TO AIR HER FEELINGS ONSTAGE." IN FACT, IT WAS REPORTED THAT MTV STAFFERS HAD TO KEEP NICKI AND MILEY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER FOR THE NIGHT TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION. IT IS HARD TO KNOW IF THEIR FIGHTING WAS STAGED OR AUTHENTIC. EITHER WAY, IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SHOUTING ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS IN PUBLIC WHEN YOU'RE UPSET IS THE BEST WAY TO GET YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS. IN NICKI'S CASE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A STRONG DESIRE TO REACH HER FAN BASE AND SHARE HER RAGE TOWARD MILEY. MAYBE SHE THOUGHT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE FACE. BUT IT REALLY ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING WITH A PARTNER IN FRONT OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS AT A HOLIDAY MEAL. SO WHEN YOU'RE IRKED AT SOMEONE, WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO LET THEM KNOW - TALK TO THEM IN PRIVATE ABOUT IT, OR LET THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW' VERY OFTEN WHEN WE ARE MAD AT SOMEONE WHO HAS HURT OUR FEELINGS OUR INCLINATION IS TO GET BACK AT THEM BY LETTING OTHERS KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO MAKE US FEEL MISTREATED AND WRONGED. IN FACT, THAT DYNAMIC IS THE HOOK OF REALITY TELEVISION. DOING THAT, THOUGH, AND BEING VOCAL ABOUT THE BAD ENERGY BETWEEN YOU MAY UNWITTINGLY PUT THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BY MAKING THEM FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE SIDES. SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET SO CAUGHT UP IN THE ANGER OF THE MOMENT THAT IT CAN SPILLOVER BEYOND THEIR PRIVATE WORLD, AS WE SAW WITH NICKI AND MILEY. BEFORE YOU LET THAT HAPPEN, ASK YOURSELF IF THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP WORTH SAVING. IF YOU DECIDE IT IS, THEN THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO GO RIGHT TO THE SOURCE AND ADDRESS THE CAUSE OF YOUR DISTRESS DIRECTLY WITH THE PERSON WHO UPSET YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE. TELL THEM WHAT THEY SAID AND DID TO SET YOU OFF, AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE AND EXPLAIN. IT WILL ALSO GIVE THE PERSON THE CHANCE TO CLEAR UP ANY MISCOMMUNICATION OR MISUNDERSTANDING THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN YOU. FIGHTING OUT IN THE OPEN JUST SERVES TO FAN THE FLAMES OF THE FURY, BUT A STRAIGHT CONVERSATION MIGHT CLEAR THE AIR AND EVEN HELP TO SALVAGE YOUR RELATIONSHIP. THIS YEAR'S VMAS WERE ALSO WITNESS TO A NUMBER OF BAD FEELINGS BEING SOOTHED, SUCH AS BETWEEN KANYE WEST AND TAYLOR SWIFT. THAT IS TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT NO MATTER HOW ANGRY SOMEONE MIGHT BE AT ONE TIME, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET OVER IT AND MOVE BEYOND IT. THE RAGE CAN DIMINISH AND YOU CAN LET IT GO.

267	MISTAKES ARE A NORMAL PHENOMENON IN LIFE. ALL HAVE, AT ONE TIME OR THE OTHER, COMMITTED A MISTAKE. SOME ARE DUE TO IGNORANCE, WHILE OTHERS ARE DUE TO SHEER FOOLHARDINESS. GENERALLY, WE TEND TO LEARN LESSONS FROM OUR MISTAKES, WHICH IN TURN HELP TO IMPROVE UPON OUR SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS IN LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR. WHILE SOME CONTINUALLY MAKE MISTAKES AND GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE LEARNING FROM THEM, LIFE DOES NOT AFFORD OTHERS THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY. A SINGLE MISTAKE FROM SUCH PERSONS IS ENOUGH TO LEAD TO YEARS OF SUFFERING. SOMETIMES A SINGLE MISTAKE IS ENOUGH TO LEAD THEM TO ETERNAL DAMNATION. THERE IS THIS TRAGIC STORY THAT I NEVER CEASE TO TELL MY STUDENTS. IT WAS ABOUT A BLOKE CALLED ELVIS. HE CAME FROM A POOR FAMILY BUT WAS SUCH A BRILLIANT, RESPECTFUL AND HARDWORKING STUDENT. HIS AMBITION WAS TO BECOME EITHER A DOCTOR OR AN ENGINEER. HE HAD HIS BASIC EDUCATION IN ONE OF THE REMOTEST PARTS OF THE VOLTA REGION BUT MANAGED TO MAKE SIX ONES. HIS AMBITION SEEMED TO BE ON COURSE WHEN HE GAINED ADMISSION INTO ONE OF THE BEST SCIENCE SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY. HE WON MANY ACADEMIC AWARDS IN THE SCHOOL DUE TO HIS DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK. IT WAS WHILE HE WAS AWAITING HIS SECONDARY SCHOOL RESULTS THAT A SINGLE MISTAKE LED TO HIS TRAGIC END. HE HAD A COUSIN WHO WAS A BICYCLE REPAIRER. BEING A VERY HARDWORKING BLOKE, HE DECIDED TO USE HIS HOLIDAYS TO LEARN BICYCLE REPAIRS FROM THE COUSIN. THE COUSIN WAS HOWEVER A BELIEVER IN THE EFFICACY OF THE GANJA HERB, POPULARLY KNOWN AS INDIAN HEMP. ONE DAY IN HIS BID TO CONVINCE THE COUSIN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO GAIN FROM GANJA , HE FOOLISHLY ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE TO SMOKE A ROLL OF THE HERB TO DISPROVE THE BELIEF THAT IT WAS EFFICACIOUS. AND THAT WAS HIS DOOM! SOON AFTER HE FINISHED SMOKING, HIS MIND STARTED PLAYING GAMES WITH HIM AND HE STARTED ACTING IN A FUNNY WAY. THAT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE, CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT HE HAD HITHERTO NOT EVEN SMOKED A CIGARETTE. IN THAT SCHIZOPHRENIC STATE, HE RUSHED HOME. HE MISTOOK A BOTTLE OF ACID GIVEN TO HIM FOR SAFEKEEPING FOR A MINERAL AND GULPED THE CONTENT. THE RESULT WAS A HUGE TRAGEDY. THE CORROSIVE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE DID NOT GIVE HIM ANY CHANCE OF SURVIVAL. HE JOINED HIS ANCESTORS IN SAMANFOLAND BEFORE THEY COULD REACH A MEDICAL FACILITY. BUT THAT WAS AFTER HE HAD HAD TO ENDURE SEVERE PAIN AND SUFFERING. MY POINT IS THAT A SINGLE MISTAKE COULD LEAD TO A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT MAY LEAD TO ONES DOOM. AS THE HEADING MAY HAVE HINTED, MY FOCUS IS ON THOSE RIDING ON THE GREAT ELEPHANT. BEING A HUMAN INSTITUTION, THE OSONO MAY HAVE MADE SOME MISTAKES IN THE PAST AND LEARNT LESSONS FROM THEM. BUT TRUST ME; ITS LATEST MISTAKE IS A VERY GRAVE ONE AND COULD GRADUALLY LEAD TO ITS UNDOING. THE CHOICE OF PAUL AFOKO AND KWABENA AGYAPONG AS CHAIRMAN AND GENERAL SECRETARY RESPECTIVELY IS WHAT I REFER TO. I DID SUPPORT KWABENAS BID DURING THE PARTY CONTEST, BUT HINDSIGHT HAS MADE ME WISER. AS FOR AFOKO, I SUSPECTED HE WOULD BE A DISASTER SO I THREW MY WEIGHT BEHIND A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE. AS WE ALL KNOW, AFOKO DID WIN THE CONTEST; AND IM SAD TO SAY HE HAS SO FAR PROVED ME RIGHT. MY RELIGIOUS UPBRINGING DOES NOT PERMIT ME TO ACCUSE OTHERS OF ILL-MOTIVE WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE, SO I WOULD NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THE AGENDA 2020 OPERATION THE DUO IS BEING ACCUSED OF. BUT THEIR ACTIONS SINCE ASSUMING OFFICE HAVE LEFT NO DOUBT IN MANY MINDS THAT THEIR SELECTION WAS A GRAVE MISTAKE. THE BELLIGERENT ATTITUDE OF THE DUO TOWARDS THE OTHER PARTY OFFICIALS HAS CONTINUALLY HEIGHTENED TENSIONS AMONG THE RANK AND FILE. SOME UNILATERAL ACTIONS OF THEIRS WHICH READILY COME TO MIND ARE THE ABORTIVE DISMISSAL OF MARTIN ADJEI KORSAH AND THE CHANGING OF SECURITY GUARDS AT THE PARTYS HEADQUARTERS, WHICH LED TO ARMED ALTERCATIONS AMONG PARTY FOLKS IN FULL GLARE OF THE MEDIA. THE HEIGHTENED TENSIONS THAT LED TO THE UNFORTUNATE ACID-POURING SAGA WERE AVOIDABLE. THE I-AM-EATING-FUFU EPISODE BY KWABENA HAS DONE THE PARTY MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THE RECENT ORCHESTRATION TO TARNISH THE IMAGE OF SOME PARTY OFFICIALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING INTERNAL CORRUPTION HAS ALSO GIVEN RISE TO MANY QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. WHY IS THE DUO SILENT ON THE ALLEGATION OF A SECRET ECOBANK ACCOUNT, WHEN THEY KNOW TOO WELL THAT THE ACCOUNT HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR CLOSE TO SEVEN YEARS? WHY DID THEY REFUSE TO SIGN THE ECOBANK SIGNATURE FORM, ONLY TO TURNAROUND TO ISSUE PRESS STATEMENTS PURPORTING TO FIGHT CORRUPTION? AND WHAT WAS THE REAL MOTIVE FOR THE PRESS RELEASE? FOR SURE, THE SECRET ACCOUNT ALLEGATION AND THE ILL-TIMED PRESS STATEMENT HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR PURPOSE. THEY HAVE INDEED TAKEN THE SHINE OFF NANA ADDOS ARISE AND BUILD TOUR AND BROUGHT NEGATIVE STORIES ABOUT THE PARTY BACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT. DID I HEAR YOU SAY SABOTAGE? I DONT KNOW WHAT NANA ADDO IS THINKING. BUT IF I WERE HIM, I WOULD BE THINKING OF HOW TO CORRECT THE GRAVE MISTAKE THE PARTY MADE IN TAMALE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM, THIS IS ONE OF THE RARE MISTAKES THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO RECTIFY. HMM, COULD THIS BE THE MISTAKE TO LEAD THE PARTY TO ETERNAL DAMNATION? MASSA, WITH SUCH HIGH LEVELS OF INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION BEING DISPLAYED BY THE SO-CALLED RESURRECTED GOAT AND HIS CRONIES, I SHUDDER TO IMAGINE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF MISRULE UNDER SUCH CONFUSED GOATS. SEE YOU NEXT WEEK FOR ANOTHER KONKONSA , DEO VOLENTE ! BY AGYA KWAKU OGBORO COMMENTS COMMENTS
268	BALLACHULISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL SECRETARY DAVE KITSON OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE'S RBS BRANCH. PICTURE: IAIN FERGUSON, THE WRITE IMAGE A LOCHABER COMMUNITY IS FIGHTING TO SAVE ITS LOCAL BANKING SERVICE AFTER LEARNING THAT ITS BRANCH IS TO CLOSE AND BE REPLACED WITH A MOBILE BANK. PEOPLE LIVING IN THE BALLACHULISH AREA WERE SHOCKED AND DISAPPOINTED TO DISCOVER THAT RBS WAS PLANNING TO CLOSE ITS BRANCH IN THE VILLAGE. THE MOVE FOLLOWS THE CLOSURE OF THE RBS BRANCH IN KINLOCHLEVEN IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, WHICH WAS ALSO OPPOSED BY LOCALS. BOTH CLOSURES HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO FALLING CUSTOMER NUMBERS DUE TO MORE PEOPLE USING ONLINE AND MOBILE BANKING. THE BANK SAID THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AT THE BALLACHULISH BRANCH HAD DROPPED BY 26 PER CENT SINCE 2011, WITH ONLY 19 CUSTOMERS USING THE BRANCH ON A REGULAR WEEKLY BASIS. A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE BANK SAID: WE HAVE TAKEN THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO CLOSE THE RBS BALLACHULISH BRANCH ON DECEMBER 7, 2015. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO ENSURE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE WAYS FOR PEOPLE IN THE AREA TO CONTINUE TO BANK WITH US. SHE ADDED THAT THEY WOULD BE INTRODUCING A MOBILE BRANCH SERVICE AND CUSTOMERS WOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS AT THE LOCAL POST OFFICE. THE SPOKESWOMAN ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE FORT WILLIAM BRANCH AND EIGHT FREE TO USE ATMS WERE WITHIN 15 MILES OF BALLACHULISH. BALLACHULISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL CHAIRMAN KEVIN SMITH SAID LOCALS WERE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE PROPOSED CLOSURE. AND HE HAS WRITTEN TO THE BANK POINTING OUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THE KINLOCHLEVEN COMMUNITY HAS EXPERIENCED SINCE ITS BRANCH CLOSED, INCLUDING DELAYS IN CREDIT AND DEBIT PAYMENTS AND THE RESULTING CHARGES. HE ADDED THAT THE FIGURES GIVEN FOR CUSTOMER USAGE AT THE BALLACHULISH BRANCH WERE SO LOW THAT THEY WERE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE. MR SMITH WROTE: YOU ARE SAYING THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH FOOTFALL IN THE BANK, BUT AT ANYTIME I AM IN THERE IS A QUEUE. AND HE HAS ASKED THE BANK TO RESPOND TO A SERIES OF QUESTIONS INCLUDING HOW MANY CUSTOMERS RBS HAS IN THE BALLACHULISH AREA INCLUDING THOSE IN KINLOCHLEVEN, DUROR AND NETHER LOCHABER. MR SMITH ALSO WANTS TO KNOW WHETHER THE MOBILE SERVICE WOULD CONTINUE THE CURRENT HOURS ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY MORNINGS, WHAT ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE MADE FOR QUEUING, ESPECIALLY IN BAD WEATHER, AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A PRIVATE ROOM FOR CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH TELLERS. FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES REGIONAL CHAIRWOMAN FOR THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS AMANDA FRAZER SAID: WHILE AROUND 75 PER CENT OF HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS MEMBERS DO NOW BANK ONLINE, BRANCHES REMAIN VITAL, WITH 64 PER CENT OF MEMBERS USING THEM FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY USE THEM FOR DEPOSITING CASH, BUT FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS AND CASH WITHDRAWALS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT.
269	"OUR LUNGS HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED AND WE CANNOT TAKE FURTHER POLLUTION THROUGH BURSTING OF CRACKERS," SAID THREE INFANTS IN THEIR PETITION BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT SEEKING A BAN ON CRACKERS THIS DUSSEHRA AND DIWALI BESIDES A HOST OF MEASURES LIKE IMPLEMENTATION OF BHARAT V NORMS FOR VEHICLES TO ARREST THE CAPITAL'S WORSENING AIR QUALITY. THEY'RE ONLY MONTHS OLD - INDIAN LAW ALLOWS THEM TO FILE PETITION! IN A FIRST OF ITS KIND PETITION IN JUDICIAL HISTORY, THE INFANTS - TWO SIX-MONTH-OLDS ARJUN GOPAL AND AARAV BHANDARI AND 14-MONTH-OLD ZOYA RAO BHASIN - MOVED THE SC THROUGH THEIR ADVOCATE FATHERS TO SEEK SEVERAL MEASURES TO MITIGATE POLLUTION AND EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO CLEAN AIR GUARANTEED UNDER ARTICLE 21 OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE SUPREME COURT RULES PERMIT MINORS TO FILE PETITIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THROUGH THEIR PARENTS AND GUARDIANS WHO TERM THEMSELVES AS 'NEXT FRIENDS'. THE IMMEDIATE PROVOCATION FOR THE FILING OF THE WRIT PETITION UNDER ARTICLE 32 OF THE CONSTITUTION WAS THE CRACKERS THAT WOULD GO UP IN A BURST OF SOUND, FLAME AND SMOKE DURING THE COMING FESTIVE SEASON. A SEASON OF SMOKE, IN THE WORLD'S MOST POLLUTED CITY THE PETITIONERS SOUGHT THE SC'S IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION "AGAINST INEVITABLE AND UPCOMING WIDESPREAD USE OF FIRECRACKERS AND FIREWORKS AND OTHER PRODUCTS OF THE SAME CLASSIFICATION, ESPECIALLY DURING DUSSEHRA AND DIWALI, BUT THEREAFTER IN ALL OTHER EVENTS AND FESTIVITIES AS WELL". THEY ALSO WANTED MEASURES TO CHECK POLLUTION HAZARDS LIKE BURNING CROP RESIDUES, POLLUTING VEHICLES AND OPEN WASTE DISPOSAL. THEY SAID, "OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, DELHI HAS RETAINED THE UNIQUE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE MOST POLLUTED CITY IN THE WORLD. THE LEVELS OF PARTICULATE MATTER ARE HIGHEST, AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, OVER 7 LAKH DEATHS OCCUR ANNUALLY DUE TO AIR-POLLUTION RELATED DISEASES. HOW POLLUTION IS CHOKING INDIA "STUDIES SHOW THAT INDIAN CITIZENS HAVE 30% LOWER LUNG CAPACITY THAN EUROPEANS, AND THAT CHILDREN ARE THE WORST AFFECTED, AS THEIR LUNGS HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED AND THEIR SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE. IN DELHI, A MAJORITY OF THE POLLUTION IS CAUSED BY OVER 500 MILLION TONNES OF CROP RESIDUE BURNT ANNUALLY IN NEIGHBOURING AREAS, BY POLLUTING TRUCKS THAT PASS THROUGH THE CITY DURING THE NIGHT, ROAD DUST AND POLLUTION FROM INDUSTRIES. "TO ADD TO THIS, THE SMOKE FROM BURSTING OF CRACKERS IN THE MONTHS OF OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER DURING THE FESTIVALS OF DUSSEHRA AND DIWALI VIRTUALLY CLOGS THE ATMOSPHERE, SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES THE POLLUTION LEVEL AND MAGNIFIES THE RISK OF CONTRACTING LUNG DISEASES." THEY SAID EVERY YEAR, THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF POLLUTION GETS DEBATED AND FORGOTTEN AS THE LETHARGIC GOVERNMENT MACHINERY DOES LITTLE TO PROTECT CITIZENS, ESPECIALLY INFANTS AND CHILDREN, FROM THE LONG-TERM TOXIC EFFECTS OF DEADLY POLLUTION ENVELOPING THE CAPITAL CITY. THE INFANTS ALSO SOUGHT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS FROM THE COURT TO THE GOVERNMENT ON A BAN ON BURNING POST-HARVEST CROP RESIDUE, STRINGENT ACTION AGAINST THOSE WHO DUMP DUST, MALBA (CONCRETE WASTE) AND OTHER POLLUTANTS AND INTRODUCING BHARAT-V EMISSION NORMS FOR VEHICLES.

270	YES, YOU CAN TAKE A WEEKEND TRIP TO PARIS! HERE'S HOW I DID. (WHITNEY TRESSEL) I GRABBED MY FIANCS HAND OUTSIDE THE IVY-DRAPED, TRELLISED GARDEN WALLS OF BRASSERIE LA CLOSERIE DES LILAS, AT THE TIP OF A RAZOR-SHARP CORNER IN MONTPARNASSE, AND HALF-LED/HALF-TUGGED HIM INSIDE, THROUGH A GAUNTLET OF FRIENDLY BONJOUR!S FROM WAITERS, ALONGSIDE TABLES OF ALFRESCO DINERS, OVER THE RESTAURANTS TILED MOSAIC FLOORS, PAST THE GRAND PIANO, AND, FINALLY, TO THE LOW-LIT COCKTAIL BAR TUCKED IN THE BACK. SAVE FOR A FEW FRENCH WOMEN QUIETLY SIPPING WHITE WINE AND BARKEEPS IN VESTS AND TIES HUSTLING TO FILL DRINK ORDERS, THE GLOWING RED SPACE WAS BLISSFULLY EMPTYAS WAS THE SPOT AT THE BAR I DESPERATELY WANTED. IT WAS EARLY, AROUND 4 P.M. THAT WAS DELIBERATE. I STEPPED AS SWIFTLY AS I COULD TO THE CURVED BAR AND PLACED MY HANDS ON EITHER SIDE OF A SMALL BRASS PLAQUE NAILED TO THE VARNISHED WOOD. HERE IT IS! I ANNOUNCED, AS MUCH TO MYSELF AS TO NEIL. HE MOVED IN CLOSER TO READ THE ENGRAVED SCRIPT: E. HEMINGWAY. LA CLOSERIE DES LILAS WAS ONE OF ERNEST HEMINGWAYS FAVORITE CAFS TO WRITE IN. HE CALLED IT HIS HOME CAF AND ARGUES WITH A NOSY ACQUAINTANCE THERE IN A PARTICULARLY AMUSING STORY IN A MOVEABLE FEAST . NEIL AND I HAD BOTH READ IT PRIOR TO THE TRIP. I HOPPED UP INTO THE RED LEATHER SEAT FACING THE PLAQUE, AND OVERFLOWING BOWLS OF COMPLIMENTARY GREEN OLIVES AND POTATO CRISPS SOON APPEARED IN FRONT OF US. I ORDERED A HEMINGWAY DAIQUIRI, MADE FROM PINEAPPLE JUICE, CITRON VERT, AND HAVANA RUM; NEIL ASKED FOR AN AMERICANO (CAMPARI, SWEET VERMOUTH, AND SELTZER). BEFORE THE DRINKS ARRIVED, NEIL SNAPPED A PICTURE OF ME AT HEMINGWAYS PERCH. YOU LOOK SO HAPPY, HE SAID. BEING IN PARIS, AT YOUR FAVORITE PLACE, WITH YOUR FAVORITE PERSON, FOLLOWING IN THE LITERAL FOOTSTEPS OF A WRITER YOU ADMIRE, WILL DO THAT. I HAD ONLY 48 HOURS TO SPEND IN THE CITY OF LIGHT, BUT A SINGLE SPECIAL MOMENT IN PARIS IS ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY AN ENTIRE TRIP. FOR ME, IT WAS THAT ONE. LAST MONTH, MY FIANC WAS CALLED AWAY ON A LAST-MINUTE BUSINESS TRIP TO PARIS. DO YOU WANT TO MEET ME THERE FOR THE WEEKEND? HE ASKED. BEFORE HE UTTERED THE D IN WEEKEND, I WAS RESEARCHING FLIGHTS ONLINE. PROBLEM WAS, I HAD ONLY ONE SUMMER FRIDAY TO BURN, MEANING ID ARRIVE AT OUR HOTEL AROUND 4 P.M. ON FRIDAY AND LEAVE FOR THE AIRPORT AT THE SAME TIME ON SUNDAY. TWO DAYS. THATS IT. I STILL SAID YES. YOU ALWAYS SAY YES TO PARIS. TRUE, PARIS HAS PLENTY OF ELEGANT WAYS TO TAKE YOUR BUDGET, STRAP DYNAMITE TO IT, TOSS IT INTO THE AIR, AND SHOOT IT LIKE ITS SKEET, BUT THAT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THE CASE. HERES HOW WE MADE OUR TRIP WORK ON A CONSERVATIVE, HEY-WERE-STILL-SAVING-MONEY-FOR-A-WEDDING BUDGET. YOU CAN TOO, THE NEXT TIME YOU SAY YES TO PARIS. PRIORITIZE LOCATION. SCHLEPPING FROM OUTER NEIGHBORHOODS TO SAVE CASH WASTES VALUABLE MINUTES, AND I WANTED NEIL TO EXPERIENCE ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARISIAN NEIGHBORHOODS, CENTRALLY LOCATED SAINT-GERMAIN-DES-PRS. THE AREA CAN BE PRICEY, BUT WE FOUND A DEAL ON TABLETHOTELS.COM FOR BOUTIQUE HTEL LE SNAT , LESS THAN A BLOCK FROM THE LOVELY, HISTORIC JARDIN DU LUXEMBOURG (FROM ABOUT $171 PER NIGHT; SEE BELOW FOR MORE HOTEL RECOMMENDATIONS). THE MOMENT I WALKED IN, I KNEW WE LUCKED OUT: OUR QUIRKY DUPLEX ROOMTHE WC DOWNSTAIRS, A SHOWER WITH A STEEPLY SLANTED SKYLIGHT UPSTAIRSHAD AIR CONDITIONING (NOT A GUARANTEE IN PARISIAN HOTELS), FIRST-FLOOR WINDOWS THAT SWUNG OPEN TO REVEAL A SPRAWLING ARRAY OF WARM YELLOW ATELIER WINDOWS, AND A PRIVATE UPSTAIRS BALCONY WHERE WE SIPPED CAF AU LAITS IN THE MORNING AND DRANK AFFORDABLE BORDEAUX LATE AT NIGHT, A VIEW OF SACR-COEUR BASILICA ON THE HORIZON, THE NEEDLE OF THE EIFFEL TOWER POKING UP IN THE WEST. TEAR UP YOUR ITINERARY. FOLLOWING YOUR HEART, NOT YOUR HEAD, IS ESSENTIAL TO IMMERSING YOURSELF IN PARIS. THE MINUTE YOU START ADHERING TO A STRICT SCHEDULE, YOURE DOING IT WRONG. WHEN I FIRST VISITED PARIS, ON A SOLO TRIP IN 2011, I CREATED AN AIRTIGHT ITINERARY OF PASTRY-MAKING CLASSES, DAY TRIPS, MUSEUM VISITS, AND RESTAURANT RESERVATIONS. IRONICALLY, THE ACTIVITIES I ENJOYED MOSTLIKE SEEING MARIE ANTOINETTES CELL AT THE CONCIERGERIE (ABOUT $9) AND SCORING A CASHMERE SWEATER ON SUPER-SALE AT ERIC BOMPARD WERENT ON MY DOCKET. THIS TRIP, I SWORE I WOULDNT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE; INSTEAD, THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS TAKE MY SWEET TIME IN A CAF, NOT WRITING POSTCARDS OR SCROLLING THROUGH EMAILS ON MY PHONE, BUT SITTING BACK WITH NEIL, EATING HAM SANDWICHES ON PERFECTLY BAKED BAGUETTES, ORDERING MORE CHEESE THAN NECESSARY, AND PRACTICING OUR FRENCH. LE ROSTAND , A CLASSIC CAF AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR HOTEL, QUICKLY BECAME OUR HOME BASE (33/1-43-54-61-58). NOTE: THIS STORY WAS ACCURATE WHEN IT WAS PUBLISHED. PLEASE BE SURE TO CONFIRM ALL RATES AND DETAILS DIRECTLY WITH THE COMPANIES IN QUESTION BEFORE PLANNING YOUR TRIP.
271	ARCHIVED - EACH DAY WE SEE THE EFFORT OF UNIONS TO FORCE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY FARM WORKERS TO PAY BRIBES TO WORK. THEN YOU HAVE THE EFFORT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES ARE FORCING WORKERS TO SPEND MORE ON WORKING CONDITIONS. THEN YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR FARMS, ESPECIALLY IF A NEW PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. THE SOLUTION IS ROBOTS AND MACHINES TO DO THE PICKING AND HARVESTING OF CROPS. WHILE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE NEW MACHINES, THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SO. YEARS AGO UC DAVIS DEVELOPED A TOMATO PICKING MACHINEBUT THE UNIONS STOPPED ITS DEVELOPMENT.  BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 8008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. AGAIN, AMERICA CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN AGRICULTURE INTERNATIONALLY. WE CAN INNOVATE AND FEED THE HUNGRY MASSES BY MAKING FOOD AVAILABILITY MORE RELIABLE AND LOW COST. 4 LABOR-INTENSIVE CROPS FARMERS WISH THEY HAD ROBOTS TO HARVEST ELIZA BARCLAY, KPBS, 9/7/15 THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION SAYS MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO PICK HOT AND BELL PEPPERS COULD HELP SOLVE LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEMS. IF YOURE ENJOYING A LATE-SUMMER FRUIT PIE THIS LABOR DAY, CONSIDER WHAT WENT INTO GROWING AND HARVESTING THAT FRUIT. CHANCES ARE, IT TOOK A LOT OF HUMAN HANDS TO ENSURE  ITS SKIN WOULD BE PERFECT AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. WHILE MACHINES HAVE REPLACED HUMAN HANDS FOR A LOT OF FARM JOBS THE HARVESTING OF TOMATOES FOR PROCESSING, THE CUTTING OF LETTUCE AND SPINACH, THE SHAKING OF ALMOND TREES TO MAKE THE NUTS FALL TO THE GROUND MANY FRUIT, VEGETABLE AND NUT FARMERS STILL RELY HEAVILY ON PEOPLE TO PLANT, MAINTAIN AND HARVEST THEIR CROPS. MACHINES DONT YET EXIST FOR THESE CROPS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN AMPLE PEOPLE TO DO  THE WORK, AND BECAUSE ITS HARD TO DESIGN MACHINES THAT CAN CUT OR PICK THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLES WITHOUT SQUISHING OR DAMAGING THEM TOO MUCH. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION  FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2028, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. ALL THATS CREATED A NEW PUSH FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO MECHANIZATION TO REPLACE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME FILLING. THERES AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF FRESH-MARKET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS, MATTHEW WHITING , AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND EXTENSION SPECIALIST AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEET CHERRY INDUSTRY, TELLS THE SALT. THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED HARVEST LABOR IS ON EVERY GROWERS MIND. FOR LABOR DAY, WE THOUGHT WED ROUND UP SOME OF THE CROPS THAT CANT YET BE HARVESTED BY A MACHINE, BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE FUTURE. TO BE CLEAR, THE ISSUE OF FARM LABOR IS COMPLICATED. AND  MACHINES THAT COULD HARVEST THESE CROPS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE. SWEET CHERRIES THESE ARE THE SOFT, SWEET CHERRIES WE GET IN BAGS WITH THE STEM ATTACHED. AND WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND PLUMP? BECAUSE A HUMAN HAND CAREFULLY PICKED THEM. BUT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER WILLING HANDS TO DO THAT WORK. AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTICED. OF ALL THE PRODUCERS THAT DREAM OF MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO EASE THEIR LABOR WOES, THE SWEET CHERRY GROWERS MIGHT BE THE CLOSEST TO GETTING ONE THANKS TO RESEARCH FUNDING. MATT WHITING SAYS HE AND OTHERS AT WSU ARE CLOSE TO FINDING A COMMERCIAL PARTNER FOR A PROTOTYPE HARVESTER THAT CAN PICK 50 TIMES AS MANY CHERRIES AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD IN THE SAME TIME. STILL, THERES ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS NEW MODEL IS VIABLE: NEW VARIETIES OF CHERRIES SUITED TO THE MECHANICAL HARVESTER WILL NEED TO BE BRED. WHITING SAYS RESEARCH IS HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT IN 10 TO 12 YEARS, SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER GROWERS A SUITE OF NEW VARIETIES. ASPARAGUS AS THE HUFFINGTON POST HAS REPORTED , ASPARAGUS IS UNIQUELY LABOR INTENSIVE BECAUSE THE QUICK-GROWING PLANT MUST BE HARVESTED EVERY DAY OF ITS THREE-MONTH GROWING SEASON. EACH PLANT SPROUTS MULTIPLE SPEARS (THE PART OF THE PLANT WE EAT) A DAY, WHICH HAVE TO BE HAND-CUT EVERY DAY. SO THAT MEANS WORKERS ARE CUTTING 14 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FROM ROUGHLY FEBRUARY TO MAY. BUT VARIOUS MECHANICAL ASPARAGUS HARVESTERS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING THEM. ACCORDING TO A 2001 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT , IF THE U.S.  GAIL TELLS SALLY THAT THEY WANT HER OUT. ASPARAGUS INDUSTRY IS TO INSURE A COMPETITIVE POSITION, IT MUST SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGY FOR LABOR TO LOWER PER UNIT COSTS AND SHIFT THE WORKFORCE TO VALUE-ADDED EMPLOYMENT. INSTITUTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW. APPLES COMMERCIAL APPLE PICKING TODAY REQUIRES BRAWN WORKERS HAVE TO FILL BUCKETS ALL DAY LONG WITH HEAVY APPLES AND THEN DUMP THEM INTO BINS. AND ACCORDING TO A FRUIT INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION , THE ERA OF FULLY AUTOMATED ROBOTIC HARVESTERS NAVIGATING [APPLE] ORCHARD ROWS IS STILL YEARS AWAY. WHITING SAYS THATS BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS DEDICATED LITTLE FUNDING DEDICATED TO RESEARCH. THATS CHANGING, THOUGH. THE WASHINGTON STATE TREE FRUIT RESEARCH COMMISSION IS NOW PURSUING MORE RESEARCH ON MECHANICAL HARVESTING. AND THIS YEAR, SOME COMMERCIAL APPLE FARMERS MAY BE USING A VACUUM HARVESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME.  THIS FALL, THE ONONDAGAS WILL START A TWO-YEAR LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAM. ITS DESIGNERS SAY IT SAVES TIME, REDUCES PICKER FATIGUE AND BOOST THE HARVEST YIELD. PEPPERS CALIFORNIA GROWS ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE PEPPERS IN THE U.S., AND LATELY THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION HAS BEEN TALKING MORE DEVELOPING MECHANICAL HARVESTING AND VARIETIES BRED TO BE PICKED BY MACHINES. ACCORDING TO A 2015 REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION, WITH INCREASING COST AND DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF LABOR NEEDED TO PICK PEPPERS, INNOVATION [SIMILAR TO THE PROCESSED TOMATO INDUSTRY] COULD GIVE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. FARMERS SIGNIFICANT RETURNS AND POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PEPPER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA, THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO HAVE FRESH MARKET QUALITY AND MECHANICAL HARVESTING IN BOTH BLOCKY [BELL PEPPERS] AND HOT TYPES.

THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO ROLL OUT BRAND SHIFTS AND EXPERIENCE UPDATES. ONE APPROACH IS THE BIG BANG, WHERE ALL THE GUIDELINES GET RESPECIFIED; NEW ASSETS ARE CREATED; AND PRODUCTS ARE BUILT, TESTED AND LAUNCHED ON ALL THE PLATFORMS AT ONCE. BANG! THIS PROCESS CAN WORK FOR NEW COMPANIES THAT ARE ABLE TO DESIGN FROM SCRATCH, OR FOR LARGE ENTERPRISES THAT CAN DEDICATE TEAMS OVER THE COURSE OF MONTHS, AND SOMETIMES YEARS TO THE ENDEAVOR. THE SECOND WAY IS INCREMENTAL. THIS IS BEST FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE GROWING FAST AND FOCUSING RESOURCES ACROSS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PROJECTS. AT ISSUU, OUR PRIORITY IS ON BRINGING AS MANY FEATURES TO PUBLISHERS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO HELP THEM GROW THEIR BUSINESS AND EXPAND THEIR AUDIENCE. STARTING FRESH ON IOS, WE HAD THE FREEDOM TO EXPERIMENT, SINCE THERE WASNT ANY RISK OF IMPINGING ON EXISTING USERS. WE WENT AHEAD AND REGARDED THE NATIVE APP AS A GUIDEPOST, A NORTH STAR INDICATING WHERE WE WANTED TO GO WITH THE BRAND AND EXPERIENCE. WE RECEIVED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK ON THE IOS APPS FUNCTIONALITY AND LOOK AND FEEL, AND WERE USING THIS TO INFORM OUR EVOLVING WEB AND ANDROID PLATFORMS. KEEPING IT LIGHT IN DEVELOPING THE IOS APP, WE SPECIFIED A FAMILY OF COLORS, BUTTON STYLES, TYPOGRAPHY AND PERSONAS TO BE APPLIED ACROSS ISSUU. THERE WAS SOME TECHNICAL WORK TO DO BEFORE WE COULD PUSH THESE CHANGES TO THE ENTIRE WEBSITE. WE REDESIGNED AND RELAUNCHED THE ISSUU HELP CENTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AS AN INCREMENTAL TEST TO SEE HOW IT WOULD AFFECT PERFORMANCE. ALTHOUGH THAT UPDATE DID INDEED CHANGE FUNCTIONALITY, BASED ON OUR CUSTOMER RESPONSES AND USER DATA WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT WE MADE THE RIGHT MOVES. THE TAN HUES IN THE NEW LIGHT THEME OF ISSUU.COM ARE MEANT TO WARM UP THE EXPERIENCE MAKING THE SITE A MORE INVITING AND FRIENDLY PLACE COMPARED WITH THE COLD WHITE, BLUE AND GREEN TONES FOUND BEFORE. SOME OF THE CHANGES ARE MORE SUBTLE: THE NEUTRAL GRAY USED IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE READER IS MEANT TO SHOWCASE OUR PUBLISHERS CONTENT MORE ACCURATELY THAN THE HEAVY BLUE BACKGROUND USED EARLIER, WHICH APPLIED SOMETHING OF A BLUE CAST TO THE CONTENT. TO BE CLEAR, WE HAVE NOT ALTERED FUNCTIONALITY; THIS IS SIMPLY A COLOR SHIFT. ALL THE MENU ITEMS, STACKS AND CONTROLS ARE EXACTLY IN THE SAME PLACE AND WORK THE SAME WAY. WHAT WE SEEK IS A CLEARER HIERARCHY OF EXISTING ELEMENTS, SUCH AS THE SEARCH BOX STANDING OUT IN WHITE, SCREAMING TYPE IN ME! FROM THIS POINT WE ARE MONITORING REACTIONS AND RESPONSES, ISOLATING AND ADDRESSING ANY PROBLEMS THAT ARISE. TYPE THE NEXT CHAPTER ONE ELEMENT THAT IS QUITE CHALLENGING TO CHANGE AT OUR SCALE IS TYPOGRAPHY. AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR MOBILE OFFERINGS, WE NEED TO EMPLOY A TYPE SPEC THAT ADJUSTS TO THE VARIOUS SIZES OF SCREENS FAVORED BY OUR USERS. WE HAVE ADAPTED OUR CURRENT TYPE SPEC OF 4 TO A FAMILY OF TYPE SPECS OF 28. THERE ISNT A DEFINITIVE DATE ON THIS RELEASE, BUT I PLEDGE TO KEEP YOU POSTED. BRAND GUIDELINES WILL BE CHANGING AS WELL WITH OUR NEW BRAND PAGES SHOWING UP SOON, ALONG WITH CLEARER MESSAGES ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT MAKE ISSUU GREAT. WERE ALWAYS DRIVING ADVANCES IN THE ISSUU EXPERIENCE. YET WE MAKE THESE MOVES AS THOUGHTFULLY AS POSSIBLE, AND HOPE YOU FIND THEM TO YOUR LIKING. OUR MISSION IS TO ENABLE PUBLISHERS TO THRIVE AND TO CONNECT READERS WITH THE CONTENT THEY LOVE. HAVE COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS? TWEET AT US @ISSUU . WERE EAGER TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK.

274	THE BLACKBERRY VENICE, THE SLIDER SMARTPHONE THAT HAS BEEN LEAKED SO MANY TIMES IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, IS ALMOST READY TO HIT RETAIL SHELVES, BUT NOT AS BLACKBERRY VENICE. (PHOTO : EVAN BLASS | TWITTER) BLACKBERRY FANS WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE TRAIL OF LEAKS LEADING UP TO THE BLACKBERRY VENICE WILL BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT BLACKBERRY VENICE WILL NOT HIT RETAIL STORES. INSTEAD, THE SLIDER SMARTPHONE THAT WILL ALSO BE BLACKBERRY'S FIRST ANDROID PHONE WILL BE SOLD AS THE BLACKBERRY PRIV. PROMINENT LEAKER EVAN BLASS, BETTER KNOWN BY HIS TWITTER HANDLE @EVLEAKS, SHARED THE NEWS ON HIS TWITTER PAGE. AT RETAIL, VENICE TRANSFORMS INTO THE... BLACKBERRY PRIV EVAN BLASS (@EVLEAKS) SEPTEMBER 23, 2015 WHILE MANY PEOPLE MAY BE DISAPPOINTED IN BLACKBERRY'S NAME CHOICE FOR ITS MUCH ANTICIPATED SMARTPHONE, IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR THE COMPANY TO NAME THE DEVICE PRIV INSTEAD. IT'S SHORT AND SNAPPY, MAKING IT JUST RIGHT FOR ITS ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT STANDS FOR THE PRIVACY-MINDED FOCUS FOR ALL BLACKBERRY PRODUCTS. STILL, VENICE DOES ROLL OFF THE TONGUE QUITE NICELY. SO LONG, VENICE. HELLO, PRIV. BLASS ALSO POSTED A BRAND NEW RENDER OF THE BLACKBERRY VENICE, ERR, BLACKBERRY PRIV ON TWITTER. THE IMAGE DOESN'T TELL US ANYTHING WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW, BUT IT DOES CONFIRM EARLIER REPORTS THAT THE SMARTPHONE WILL RUN ON NEARLY STOCK ANDROID WITH A FEW BLACKBERRY FEATURES. IT ALSO SHOWS THE PHYSICAL KEYBOARD SLIDING OUT FROM UNDER THE HUGE DISPLAY, AS WELL AS THE BLACKBERRY LOGO ON TOP OF THE DISPLAY. . @CRACKBERRY THAT RENDER IS GETTING A BIT TIRED, DONTCHA THINK? PIC.TWITTER.COM/UZSANAU6DF EVAN BLASS (@EVLEAKS) SEPTEMBER 24, 2015 MEANWHILE, THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE MORE COLOR ON THE UPCOMING BLACKBERRY HANDSET MAY CHECK OUT A GROUP OF NEW RENDERS DEVELOPED BY DESIGNER @POOTERMOBILE. WHEN BLACKBERRY PRESIDENT OF DEVICES AND EMERGING SOLUTIONS RON LOUKS TEASED BLACKBERRY PRIV AT THE MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS IN MARCH, HE ONLY SHOWED A DEVICE IN BLACK AND WHITE. THESE NEW RENDERS ADDING RED, PURPLE, SILVER AND SKY BLUE, HOWEVER, LEND AN INTERESTING TWIST TO THE SMARTPHONE. WHILE THE BLACKBERRY PRIV MAY OFFICIALLY LAUNCH ONLY IN BLACK AND WHITE, IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR BLACKBERRY TO RELEASE NEW COLORS AFTERWARDS. AFTER ALL, THE SQUARE-DISPLAY BLACKBERRY PASSPORT HAD A LIMITED EDITION IN RED, AND THE REDESIGNED SMARTPHONE CAME IN SILVER. NO RELEASE DATE HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED FOR THE BLACKBERRY PRIV, BUT AS THE NUMEROUS LEAKS AND EVEN A HANDS-ON VIDEO POINT OUT, IT'S LIKE THE NEW SMARTPHONE WILL BE UNVEILED SOON ENOUGH. THE BLACKBERRY PRIV IS SHAPING UP TO BE A PRETTY INTERESTING DEVICE, WITH A SNAPDRAGON 810 SOC, 3 GB OF RAM, A 5.4-INCH QUAD HD DISPLAY, AN 18-MEGAPIXEL BACK CAMERA AND A 5-MEGAPIXEL FRONT SHOOTER.

275	IT'S BEEN A BUSY YEAR FOR GEORGE ZIMMER, THE MAN BEST KNOWN FOR LAUNCHING MEN'S WEARHOUSE IN 1973. EARLIER THIS YEAR, ZIMMERWHO WAS OUSTED AS THE CEO AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF MEN'S WEARHOUSE IN 2013LAUNCHED ZTAILORS , A SERVICE THAT DISPATCHES TAILORS TO YOUR HOME OR OFFICE ON DEMAND. TOMORROW, AT DREAMFORCE, HE'S LAUNCHING ANOTHER COMPANY, GENERATION TUX , THAT ALLOWS MEN TO ORDER SUITS AND TUXES ONLINE. GENERATION TUX CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE NETWORK OF TAILORS THROUGH ZTAILORS WHO WILL BE ON HAND TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS, IF NECESSARY. THERE ARE 17 DIFFERENT SUIT STYLES AVAILABLE AND THEY EACH COST A FLAT RATE OF $95 TO RENT. YOU CAN RENT AN ENTIRE OUTFIT, INCLUDING SHIRTS, SHOES, TIES, AND CUFF LINKS, FOR $150. WHILE THE GENERATION TUX WEBSITE JUST WENT LIVE LAST NIGHT, ZIMMER AND HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN TESTING THE SITE IN BETA WITH CUSTOMERS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. "IT WORKS, THANK GOD," HE SAYS. GENERATION TUX IS NOT THE FIRST ONLINE TUX RENTAL BUSINESS TO HIT THE MARKET. COMPANIES LIKE THE BLACK TUX , MENGUIN , AND SIMPLE TUX ALL HAVE SIMILAR BUSINESS MODELS AND PRICE THEIR TUXES SIMILARLY. ZIMMER TELLS FAST COMPANY THAT HE HAS A TWOFOLD APPROACH TO DIFFERENTIATING GENERATION TUX FROM HIS COMPETITORS. THE FIRST IS IN SCALE. ZIMMER HAS RAISED $50 MILLION ACROSS TWO FINANCINGS, WITH PRINCIPAL INVESTORS THAT INCLUDE DAVE DUFFIELD, LYRICAL PARTNERS, AND MERITAGE. ZIMMER SAYS THAT SALESFORCE VENTURES HAS ALSO BECOME A FULL PARTNER IN THE BUSINESS. THIS INFLUX OF CAPITAL HAS GONE TOWARD ESTABLISHING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING A DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN LOUISVILLE, KY., THAT HOUSES 30,000 SUITS AND A DRY-CLEANING FACILITY TO ENSURE A QUICK TURNAROUND. "WE'RE READY TO SHIP IN QUANTITY WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO PUT UP A SIGN THAT SAYS, 'WE'RE SORRY, WE'RE OUT OF THIS STYLE,'" ZIMMER SAYS. BUT ZIMMER IS ALSO HOPING TO SET GENERATION TUX APART BY INVESTING HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY. "THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF BUILDING THIS BUSINESS WAS DESIGNING AND CODING THE WEBSITE," HE SAYS. THE SITE COMES WITH A LOT OF BELLS AND WHISTLES, INCLUDING A VISUALIZER THAT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO PUT DIFFERENT MERCHANDISE ON A MANNEQUIN, AND A WEDDING MANAGEMENT TOOL TO ALLOW BRIDES AND GROOMS TO SEE WHERE EACH GROOMSMAN IS IN THE TUX RENTAL PROCESS. ONCE A CUSTOMER HAS INPUT THEIR MEASUREMENTS ONLINE, TAILORS AT THE WAREHOUSE WILL ADJUST EACH SUIT OR TUX BEFORE IT IS DELIVERED. FOR ADDITIONAL ALTERATIONS, ZTAILORS WILL BE DEPLOYED TO ENSURE A PERFECT FIT. LAUNCHING GENERATION TUX AT DREAMFORCE SEEMS LIKE AN UNUSUAL MOVE FOR A CLOTHING E-COMMERCE COMPANY. BUT ZIMMER EXPLAINS THAT THIS DECISION MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. "WE REALLY THINK OF OURSELVES AS MUCH AS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AS WE DO A TUXEDO RENTAL BUSINESS," ZIMMER SAYS. MARK BENIOFF, A FRIEND OF ZIMMER'S, HAS BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE COMPANY, BOTH BY INVESTING IN IT AS WELL AS BY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS. ZIMMER EXPLAINS THAT THE GENERATION TUX PLATFORM HAS BEEN OUTFITTED END TO END WITH SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGY. AT DREAMFORCE, THE COMPANY WILL BE USED AS A CASE STUDY ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH SALESFORCE TOOLS.
276	THE COMPANY'S NEW PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HELP CHINESE COMPANIES WORKING IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS INDUSTRY AS IF CHINESE FACTORIES WEREN'T ALREADY PRODUCING ENOUGH OF OUR GADGETS, CHIP DESIGNER ARM HOLDINGS WANTS TO HELP CHINESE STARTUPS PRODUCE MORE WEARABLE DEVICES, ROBOTS AND SMART HOME PRODUCTS. TO THAT END, THE U.K. COMPANY IS SETTING UP AN "ACCELERATOR" IN BEIJING STAFFED WITH EXPERTS WHO CAN PROVIDE CHINESE COMPANIES WITH TIPS ON PRODUCT DESIGN INCLUDING WHICH CHIPS OR SOFTWARE TO USE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME ARM HAS CREATED SUCH A PROGRAM, AND ITS AIM IS TO REMOVE ANY BARRIERS THAT MIGHT HINDER CHINESE STARTUPS FROM QUICKLY DELIVERING THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COUNTRY IS ALREADY HOME TO NUMEROUS COMPANIES, LARGE AND SMALL, DEVELOPING SMARTPHONES, WEARABLES AND OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES. HOWEVER, LOCAL STARTUPS TYPICALLY POSSESS FEW RESOURCES, AND NOT ENOUGH KNOW-HOW TO QUICKLY DELIVER THEIR PRODUCTS, ACCORDING TO ARM. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE INCLUDE SELECTING THE RIGHT COMPONENTS, OPTIMIZING THE DEVICE'S SOFTWARE, OR FINDING OUT WHICH OPERATING SYSTEM BEST FITS THEIR NEEDS. ARM'S ACCELERATOR PROGRAM WANTS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES BY PROVIDING WORKSHOPS, TRAINING AND DESIGN SERVICES RELATING TO THE COMPANY'S OWN CHIP DESIGNS. THE U.K. COMPANY IS BEST KNOWN FOR SUPPLYING THE PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY USED IN MOST SMARTPHONE AND TABLETS. BUT ARM ALSO WANTS TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS INTO IOT AREAS SUCH AS SMART CITIES, SMART HOMES AND HEALTHCARE, WHERE ITS LOW-POWER CONSUMING PROCESSORS COULD FLOURISH. LAST YEAR, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS MBED PLATFORMTO HELP VENDORS BUILD IOT SYSTEMS. SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT ARM'S ACCELERATOR IN CHINA WILL ALSO BE OFFERING DESIGN SERVICES AROUND MBED. BUT ON MONDAY IN BEIJING, ARM'S CEO SIMON SEGARS SAID THAT THE ACCELERATOR WILL ALSO OPEN ITSELF TO OTHER IOT PLATFORMS FROM OTHER COMPANIES. THE GOAL IS TO ESSENTIALLY CONNECT CHINESE STARTUPS WITH THE APPROPRIATE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS, MANY OF WHOM ARE ALREADY PARTNERS WITH ARM, HE ADDED. THE ACCELERATOR WILL WORK THROUGH A COMPANY ARM HAS ESTABLISHED WITH BEIJING-BASEDTHUNDERSOFT, WHICH ALREADYSPECIALIZES IN HELPING SMARTPHONE AND TABLET VENDORS REFINE THE SOFTWARE ON THEIR DEVICES.THE ACCELERATOR'S FIRST OFFICE WILL BE BASED IN BEIJING, BUT TO REACH MORE STARTUPS, FOUR OR FIVE OTHER OFFICES WILL BE SET UP ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO. ALL CHINESE COMPANIES ARE INVITED TO JOIN. THE NEW PROGRAM WILL SURELY HELP PROMOTE ARM'S CHIP DESIGNS AND SOFTWARE, BUT IT COULD ALSO ASSIST CHINESE VENDORS IN CREATING SUCCESSFUL IOT PRODUCTS,SAID KITTY FOK, AN ANALYST WITH RESEARCH FIRM IDC. IN THE FUTURE, ARM COULD EVEN ADVISE THESE CHINESE STARTUPS ON WHAT OPPORTUNITIES ARE EMERGING IN THE MARKET, OR WHICH CUSTOMERS TO TARGET, SHE ADDED.
277	FROM A NOTORIOUS CON MAN TO CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES, THIS GRAND HOME -- NAY, THIS GRAND COMPOUND -- IN THE HEART OF THE LOS FELIZ NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES HAS HOUSED QUITE A CAST OF CHARACTERS OVER THE YEARS. WITH 14 BEDROOMS AND EIGHT BATHROOMS, IT'S RICH WITH HISTORY AND BRIMMING WITH POSSIBILITIES. BUILT IN 1929 BY ARCHITECT HARLEY S. BRADLEY FOR A MAN NAMED RUDOLPH ROSENBERG , IT WAS SOLD THE SAME YEAR TO MUSIC STORE MAGNATE BEN PLATT . OVER THE YEARS, PLATT HIRED ARCHITECTS PAUL R.  TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS WAVES AFTER SPEAKING AT A REPUBLICAN VICTORY PARTY IN AUSTIN, TEXAS. WILLIAMS AND ALBERT E. HANSEN , TO EXPAND IT, ADDING A POOL, TENNIS COURTS, AND ANOTHER STORY TO BRING IT TO ITS CURRENT 10,000-SQUARE-FOOT MEASUREMENT. THE NEXT OWNER WAS A NOTORIOUS CON MAN NAMED C.C. JULIAN , WHOM LISTING AGENT DAVID SOLOMON DESCRIBES AS THE BERNIE MADOFF OF HIS DAY.  IN THE LATE 1950S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OWNER TOOK OVER: THE SAINT COLUMBAN'S FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY, A GROUP OF CATHOLIC MISSIONARY PRIESTS WHO STILL LIVE THERE TODAY. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES MADE TO THE HOME OVER THE YEARS (SPACES WERE DIVIDED TO CREATE ADDITIONAL ROOMS TO HOUSE PRIESTS), SOLOMON SAYS THE HOME RETAINS MANY OF ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES, INCLUDING CARVED FIREPLACES AND DETAILED WOODWORK. THE MOST NOTEWORTHY HISTORIC FEATURE IS A CAVE THAT LEADS TO A HIDDEN WINE CELLAR TO A FULL SPEAK-EASY USED DURING PROHIBITION. THERE ARE ALSO QUARTERS FOR LIVE-IN STAFF. SOLOMON SAYS IT WILL TAKE THE RIGHT BUYER TO BRING THE HOME TO PRESENT-DAY STANDARDS, BUT THE RETURN COULD BE HUGE. CURRENTLY LISTED FOR $5,499,000, THE PROPERTY COULD BE VALUED AT OVER $12 MILLION POSTRENOVATION BASED ON ITS SIZE, HISTORY, AND LOCATION. "WHEN IT'S REDONE, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES IN LOS ANGELES," HE SAYS. ALTHOUGH THE HOME IS SET BACK FROM THE ROAD, IT FEATURES AMAZING CITY VIEWS AND IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HOLLYWOOD'S GREEK THEATRE AND GRIFFITH PARK. AS FOR THE NEIGHBORS, THINK HOLLYWOOD STARS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOME BEHIND THIS PROPERTY USED TO BE ROBERT PATTINSON 'S LOVE NEST WITH THEN-GIRLFRIEND KRISTEN STEWART . THE "TWILIGHT" STAR SOLD THE HOME IN 2014, AND NOW JIM PARSONS OF "THE BIG BANG THEORY" LIVES THERE. SO WHO'LL BE NEXT TO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THIS HISTORIC HOME? SOLOMON SAYS WHILE IT COULD BE ANYONE FROM A SINGLE FAMILY TO A PRODUCTION COMPANY, THE LUCKY OWNER WILL DEFINITELY POSSESS ONE QUALITY. "THE RIGHT BUYER WILL BE SOMEONE WHO HAS AN APPRECIATION FOR THE TYPE OF HOME THEY JUST DON'T BUILD ANYMORE," HE SAID. "THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS."

279	ANDROID MARKET SHARE STAYS STEADY IN US BUT SINKS DEEPER IN EUROPE MORE THAN A QUARTER OF SMARTPHONE BUYERS ACROSS EUROPE JUMPED SHIP FROM ANDROID TO IOS, WHICH SAW SOLID GAINS ACROSS MOST OF THE CONTINENT, SAYS RESEARCH FIRM KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH. BY LANCE WHITNEY @LANCEWHIT SEPTEMBER 2, 2015 8:03 AM PDT UPDATED: SEPTEMBER 2, 2015 8:03 AM PDT ANDROID REMAINS TOP DOG AROUND THE WORLD BUT CONTINUES TO SHED MARKET SHARE IN EUROPE. CNET ANDROID REMAINS BY FAR THE TOP MOBILE OS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, BUT ITS MARKET SHARE CONTINUES TO LOSE GROUND EXCEPT IN THE US. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY, ANDROID'S SLICE OF THE SMARTPHONE MARKET FOR THE TOP FIVE EUROPEAN NATIONS (FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, SPAIN AND THE UK) DROPPED BY 4.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 71 PERCENT FROM 75.1 PERCENT FOR THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO, KANTAR REPORTED ON WEDNESDAY. THE CHANGES IN MARKET SHARE VARIED ACROSS THE BOARD.  "HE WILL BRING GREAT CREATIVITY AND ENERGY TO THE NEW FACT-CHECKERS' NETWORK." MANTZARLIS WILL BEGIN HIS NEW POSITION AT THE END OF THIS MONTH, WHILE THE INTERNATIONAL FACT- CHECKING NETWORK IS EXPECTED TO DEBUT ON POYNTER.ORG IN OCTOBER. ANDROID'S SHARE TUMBLED BY 8.7 POINTS IN GERMANY AND 5.4 POINTS IN FRANCE BUT INCHED DOWN JUST 1.5 POINTS IN ITALY AND ACTUALLY GAINED ALMOST A POINT IN SPAIN. BUT IN THE US, ANDROID'S MARKET SHARE GREW BY 1.7 POINTS TO 65.6 PERCENT FROM 63.9 PERCENT DURING THE SAME THREE MONTHS IN 2014. THE SITUATION WAS THE REVERSE FOR APPLE'S IOS. THE IPHONE'S MARKET SHARE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY GREW BY 2.5 POINTS ACROSS EUROPE'S TOP FIVE COUNTRIES TO REACH 17 PERCENT. APPLE'S SMARTPHONE MARKET SHARE DECLINED BY 1.3 PERCENT IN THE US, THOUGH WAS LOWER THAN THE 2.3 PERCENT DROP FOR THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS. WHY IS ANDROID LOSING GROUND IN EUROPE BUT STAYING STEADY IN THE US, WHILE APPLE'S IOS IS DOING THE OPPOSITE? THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS, CAROLINA MILANESI, CHIEF OF RESEARCH AT KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH, TOLD CNET.  CERTAIN FLAGSHIP PHONES, SUCH AS SAMSUNG'S GALAXY S6, HAVE RECEIVED A MUTED RESPONSE FROM BUYERS.  "THIS IS HAT WE HAVE TO DO TO SAVE OUR LANGUAGE." SARAH MOSES COVERS THE NORTHERN SUBURBS OF ONONDAGA COUNTY AND OSWEGO COUNTY. ALSO, SAMSUNG AND OTHER ANDROID PLAYERS ARE FACING INCREASED COMPETITION FROM LOCAL VENDORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN CHINA. ANOTHER REASON IS THE MATURITY OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET AS EVIDENCED BY FEWER FIRST-TIME SMARTPHONE BUYERS, ACCORDING TO KANTAR. THAT TYPE OF MATURITY INCREASES THE CHURN RATE, MEANING THE RATE AT WHICH EXSTING SMARTPHONE BUYERS SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM. AND IN EUROPE, THAT HIT ANDROID HARDER THAN IT DID APPLE. "THIS TYPE OF MARKET MATURITY INCREASES THE IMPACT OF CHURN ON OVERALL PERFORMANCE AS WE HAVE EEN WITH ANDROID THIS TIME AROUND -- 27 PERCENT OF SMARTPHONE BUYERS ACROSS EUROPE LEFT ANDROID FOR IOS VERSUS 9 PERCENT IN THE US," DOMINIC SUNNEBO, BUSINESS UNIT DIRECTOR AT KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH EUROPE, SAID IN A PRESS RELEASE. SWITCHING TO A DIFFERENT CARRIER TYPICALLY OCCURS LESS IN THE US THAN IN EUROPE. THAT'S BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE IN THEUS ARE ON CONTRACT OR INSTALLMENT PLANS, WHILE MANY OF THOSE IN EUROPE ARE ON PREPAID PLANS, WHICH LEAD TO LONGER REPLACEMENT CYCLES. "I ALSO FEEL THAT THE 'I AM AN APPLE' AND 'I AM AN ANDROID' GROUPS ARE MORE CLEARLY DEFINED [IN THE US] THAN IN EUROPE," MILANESE ADDED. IN THE UNITED STATES, APPLE'S ANDROID RIVALS PROVIDED A TOUGHER FIGHT THAN THEY DID IN EUROPE. APPLE AND SAMSUNG STILL REGN SUREME IN THE US. BUT OTHER VENDORS SUCH AS LG HAVE GAINED MARKET SHARE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF NEW MOBILE DATA PLANS ON MID-RANGE PHONES, MILANESI TOLD CNET IN AUGUST. EARLY DEMAND FOR THE IPHONE IN THE US WAS STRONG, SO SALES WOULD NATURALLY BE LEVELING OFF BY THIS POINT, ESPECIALLY WITH APPLE DUE TO UNVEIL ITS NEXT IPHONE LINEUP ON SEPTEMBER 9. THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE AN OFF-YEAR FOR THE IPHONE IN WHICH APPLE INTRODUCES INTERIM MODELS -- THE IPHONE 6S AND IPHONE 6S PLUS -- WITH PERHAPS ONE OR TWO MAJOR NEW FEATURES BUT MOSTLY MINOR UPGRADES IN PROCESSOR SPEED AND A FEW OTHER FACTORS. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IPHONE SALES WILL SUFFER, ESPECIALLY IF APPLE OWERS THE PRICE ON THE CURRENT IPHONE 6 LINEUP. "WHILE ALL EYES WILL BE ON APPLE'S NEW PRODUCTS, I WOULD SUGGEST PEOPLE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CURRENT IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS MARKET PERFORMANCE, SHOULD THE ACCUSTOMED PRICE DROP OCCUR AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 9 PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT," MILANESE SAID. "IN THE US., 32 PERCENT OF THE OVERALL SALES OF THE IPHONE 5S WERE GENERATED AFTER THE LAUNCH OF THE IPHONE 6." AND HOW DID ANDROID AND APPLE FARE ACROSS OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD? IN CHINA, ANDROID'S SMARTPHONE SHARE DROPPED BY 5.5 POINTS, WHILE THE IPHONE'S SLICE ROSE BY 5.9 POINTS.  DUE TO A COMBINATION OF RISING U.S. CHINA'S SMARTPHONE MARKET HAS WEAKENED AS OF LATE DUE TO OVERSATURATION, BUT THE IPHONE IS STILL A HOT DEVICE. FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, APPLE REPORTED THAT SALES IN GREATER CHINA MORE THAN DOUBLED TO $13.2 BILLION. IN AUSTRALIA, ANDROID'S SHARE PLUMMETED BY 10.5 POINTS TO 56.1 PERCENT, WHILE APPLE'S CUT ROSE BY 7.9 PERCENT TO 34.9 PERCENT. AND IN JAPAN, ANDROID'S SLICE OF THE MARKET DROPPED BY 7 POINTS, WHILE APPLE'S INCREASED BY 6.3 POINTS.

280	WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY OFF AT HOME MAKES! THE GIANTS RETURNED FROM A 10 GAME ROAD TRIP WITH THEIR TAILS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS. AFTER A DAY OFF, THEY SHOWED UP AT AT&T PARK ALL BRIGHT EYED AND BUSY TAILED AGAIN AND TOOK IT TO THE PADRES WITH NICE PITCHING FROM JAKE PEAVY, SOLID DEFENSE AND A PERSISTENT OFFENSIVE ATTACK THAT WORE DOWN PADRES STARTER ANDREW CASHNER. KEY LINES: ANGEL PAGAN- 1 FOR 5. BA= .261. PAGAN HAD JUST ONE HIT IN THE GAME, BUT IT DROVE IN THE FIRST RUN. HE ALSO MADE A SPECTACULAR CATCH ABOVE THE CF WALL TO ROB MATT KEMP OF A HR. PAGAN IS A BIT OF A POLARIZING PLAYER, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MEASURING HIS DEFENSE, BUT WHEN HE IS FULLY HEALTHY, WHICH HE FINALLY APPEARS TO BE, HE CAN MAKE SPECTACULAR PLAYS. LOOK UP THE VIDEO ON THIS ONE! MATT DUFFY- 2 FOR 4, BB. BA= .300. NOBODY GRINDS OUT AB'S LIKE THE DUFFMAN AND HE USES THE ENTIRE FIELD. IN THIS ONE, HE PULLED A SINGLE THROUGH THE HOLE BETWEEN 3'RD AND SHORT AND ANOTHER WHERE HE POKED ONE INTO RF. AFTER CASHNER OPENED THE GAME WITH TWO QUICK K'S ON PAGAN AND DE AZA, DUFFY WORKED HIM FOR THE FIRST OF 2 WALKS WHICH PUSHED UP HIS PITCH COUNT AND SET THE STAGE FOR THE GRIND DOWN.

281	SOURCE: IRANNEWSUPDATE.COM BY INU STAFF INU - THE AUTUMN SESSION OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL WAS OPENED ON MONDAY AND IS SCHEDULED TO CONTINUE UNTIL THE FIRST WEEK OF OCTOBER. SOME IRANIAN HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS ARE USING THIS OCCASION AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECALL ATTENTION TO A VARIETY OF ONGOING AND SYSTEMIC HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC. A HANDFUL OF STORIES HAVE ALREADY EMERGED IN SERVICE OF THIS PROJECT THIS WEEK, BEGINNING WITH THE NEWS OF THE POSSIBLE ASSASSINATION IN PRISON OF LABOR RIGHTS ACTIVIST SHAHROKH ZAMANI. THE VIOLENT TREATMENT OF ACTIVISTS ALSO RECALLS ATTENTION TO THE CRIMINALIZATION OF HONEST SOCIAL AND POLITICAL REPORTING IN THE COUNTRY. JOURNALISTS TOO HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THE SORTS OF ABUSE THAT APPARENTLY KILLED ZAMANI. DEMONSTRATING THIS FACT, IRANWIRE AND ITS SISTER SITE JOURNALISM IS NOT A CRIME BOTH REPORTED UPON THE CONCLUSION OF A STUDY BY A UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO PSYCHIATRY PROFESSOR, WHICH FOUND THAT ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE IRANIAN JOURNALISTS INTERVIEWED FOR THE STUDY HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT SOME POINT. ABOUT 20 PERCENT HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TORTURE. ADDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF THIS STUDY, IRANWIRE INTERVIEWED DAVID OEHLENSCHLAEGER, THE DIRECTOR OF REHABILITATION AT DIGNITY, A FACILITY THAT SPECIALIZES IN TRAUMA REHABILITATION FOR VICTIMS OF TORTURE. HE NOTED THAT ONE OF THE LARGEST GROUPS THEY DEAL WITH IS COMPRISED OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TORTURED BY THE IRANIAN REGIME. BOTH REPORTS ALSO DETAILED HOW THE EXPERIENCE OF TORTURE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO MANY INSTANCES OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND DEPRESSION AMONG MEMBERS OF THE IRANIAN DIASPORA. IT HAS ALSO DISCOURAGED PEOPLE FROM CONTINUING IN THE JOURNALISM PROFESSION OR AT LEAST FROM KEEPING ON WITH PARTICULAR PROJECTS, IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD EITHER THEIR OWN LIVES OR THOSE OF THEIR FAMILY. NEARLY 80 PERCENT OR PARTICIPANTS IN THE STUDY REPORTED THAT THEIR WORK HAD BEEN HALTED BY THE REGIMES REPRESSION, AND HALF OF ALL PARTICIPANTS SAID THAT THREATS HAD NOT BEEN LIMITED TO THEM BUT HAD INCLUDED THEIR FAMILIES. IN LIGHT OF ALL THESE STATISTICS, ONE COULD SAY THAT JOURNALISTS COLLECTIVELY COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT UNDERCLASS OF IRANIAN SOCIETY THAT IS SUBJECT TO SYSTEMATIC ABUSE AND REPRESSION IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES. HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS HAVE CONTINUALLY REPORTED ON THE PLIGHT OF IRANIANS WHO MAINTAIN FAITHS OTHER THAN SHIITE ISLAM. OF THESE, THE FOLLOWERS OF FAITHS THAT ORIGINATED IN THE AREA OF IRAN ARE TARGETED WITH PARTICULAR AGGRESSION, AND THE MOST PROMINENT OF THESE IS THE BAHAI FAITH. THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS NEWS AGENCY REITERATED ONE ASPECT OF THIS ABUSE ON SUNDAY, NAMELY THE BARRING OF BAHAI STUDENTS FROM ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. HRANA REPORTS THAT AHEAD OF THE CURRENT ACADEMIC YEAR, A NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FROM BAHAI STUDENTS HAVE BEEN DENIED VIA A MESSAGE THAT SIMPLY DECLARES THEIR FILES TO BE INCOMPLETE. THERE IS NO RECOURSE FOR PROTESTING SUCH ARBITRARY REJECTIONS, AND LOCAL BAHAIS ALONG WITH HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH AN ALTERNATIVE COURSE OF EDUCATION OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICIAL IRANIAN SYSTEM. BUT THESE EFFORTS TOO HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BY THE IRANIAN AUTHORITIES, WHO RAIDED AN CLOSED DOWN THE BAHAI INSTITUTE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION SEVERAL TIMES SINCE ITS OPENING IN 1987. WHILE THESE TYPES OF REPRESSION HAVE BEEN RELENTLESS, THE BAHAI COMPRISE ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE IRANIAN POPULATION. MUCH LARGER MINORITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO COORDINATED REPRESSION, WITH THE LARGEST OF THESE CERTAINLY BEING THE POPULATION OF WOMEN. THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF THIS COME IN THE FORM OF WOMENS SOCCER PLAYER NILUFAR ARDALAN, WHOSE NAME WAS RECENTLY REMOVED FROM THE ROSTER FOR THE IRANIAN NATIONAL INDOOR SOCCER TEAM, AFTER IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TRAVEL FOR GAMES. AT ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT IRANIAN LAW REQUIRES WOMEN TO GET PERMISSION FROM THEIR HUSBANDS BEFORE EITHER APPLYING FOR OR RENEWING A PASSPORT. AND SINCE ARDALANS PASSPORT EXPIRED, HER HUSBAND REFUSES TO ALLOW HER TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, CITING THE CLAIM THAT SHE IS NEEDED AT HOME AT A TIME WHEN THEIR SON IS BEGINNING SCHOOL. IRANWIRE INTERVIEWED LALEH EFTEKHARI, A MEMBER OF THE IRANIAN PARLIAMENTS WOMENS CAUCUS, OVER THIS STORY. BUT WHEN THEY RAISED THE QUESTION OF CHANGING THE LAW, THEY WERE REBUFFED AND EFTEKHARI DECLARED SUCH DENIALS OF THE LEGAL AUTONOMY OF WOMEN TO BE REQUIREMENTS OF SHARIA LAW. IT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN EMPHASIZED BY WOMENS RIGHTS GROUPS THAT DESPITE THE TECHNICAL PRESENCE OF A WOMENS CAUCUS, WOMEN LACK REPRESENTATION IN IRANIAN GOVERNMENT, AS FEMALE PARLIAMENTARIANS ARE LIMITED TO PERSONS WITH STRICT CONSERVATIVE VIEWS ON RELIGION AND FAMILY, LIKE EFTEKHARI. BY CONTRAST, MANY VICTIMS OF ORGANIZED REPRESSION HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO SPEAK OUT, AND ARDALAN NOW APPEARS TO BE ONE OF THEM. SHE HAS DECIDED TO GO PUBLIC WITH HER STORY AND HER REFUTATIONS OF HER HUSBANDS STATEMENTS. SOCIAL MEDIA IN PARTICULAR IS BECOMING AN OUTLET FOR HER VIEWS AND THOSE OF HER SUPPORTERS, MUCH AS IT HAS BEEN FOR WOMENS RIGHTS ACTIVISTS IN THE PAST. BUT THIS TOO HIGHLIGHTS ASPECTS OF TEHRANS REPRESSIVE MEASURES, SINCE ACTIVISTS IN GENERAL AND WOMENS RIGHTS ACTIVISTS IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO HARSH REPRISALS AND PROSECUTION AS A RESULT OF THEIR ONLINE ACTIVITIES. SOCIAL NETWORKS LIKE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER REMAIN TECHNICALLY BANNED THROUGHOUT THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC, ALTHOUGH MANY CITIZENS WORK AROUND THESE BLOCKS. THOSE WHO DO ARE IN DANGER OF BEING CHARGED WITH SPREADING PROPAGANDA OR INSULTING IRANIAN OFFICIALS IF THEY MAKE CRITICAL POSTS. FOUR NEW SUCH ARRESTS WERE ANNOUNCED BY THE JUDICIARY ON AUGUST 30. AND NOW, THE INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAN REPORTS THAT THE OFFICE OF IRANIAN SUPREME LEADER ALI KHAMENEI HAS TAKEN MEASURES TO CONSOLIDATE POWER FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF INTERNET RESTRICTIONS AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF INTERNET-BASED CRIMES. KHAMENEI REPORTEDLY ORDERED ALL DECISIONS ON INTERNET POLICY TO BE HANDLED BY THE SUPREME CYBERSPACE COUNCIL, WHICH ANSWERS DIRECTLY TO HIM, THUS CIRCUMVENTING ALL LOWER FEDERAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES. THE INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN POINTS OUT THAT IRAN IS SECOND ONLY TO CHINA IN THE NUMBER OF WEBSITES THAT ITS GOVERNMENT BLOCKS. AND IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT THIS SITUATION WILL WORSE IN LIGHT OF THE LATEST NEWS, WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW POSTS TO THE SUPREME CYBERSPACE COUNCIL, INCLUDING TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LISTED AS VIOLATORS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY BOTH THE US AND THE EU.

283	( SEC2SV ) NEXT WEEK,AIMINGTO BRINGTOGETHER EUROPEAN POLICY MAKERS, A LOAD OF HIGH-QUALITY EUROPEANSCALEUPS, ANDMAJOR PLAYERS IN SILICON VALLEY. INSPIRED BYSILICON VALLEY COMES TO UNITED KINGDOM ( SVC2UK ), AND FUNDED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S STARTUP EUROPE INITIATIVE, SEC2V HOPES CREATE COLLABORATIONAND SHARE GOOD LEARNING, FOR EVERYONE'S BENEFIT. THE WEEK STARTS ON MONDAY SEPTEMBER 21ST WITH ' EUROPEAN INNOVATION DAY ', HELDAT THE COMPUTER HISTORY MUSEUM INMOUNTAIN VIEW. THE LOCATION IS APPROPRIATE, GIVEN THE TREMENDOUS EUROPEAN -AND ESPECIALLY BRITISH -CONTRIBUTIONS TO COMPUTING. FROM CHARLESBABBAGE'S DIFFERENCE ENGINE ANDADA LOVELACE'S FIRST PROGRAMMING,THOUGH GEORGE BOOLE'S BOOLEAN ALGEBRA ANDKONRAD ZUSE'SMECHANICAL BINARY PROGRAMMABLE COMPUTERS, TO THE COLOSSAL WORK ATBLETCHLEY PARK AND THECREATION OF THE WEB BYTIM BERNERS-LEE, EUROPEAN INNOVATORSLAID MANY OF THE FOUNDATIONS. HOPEFULLY, THIS FIRST DAY WILL REINFORCE THE TREMENDOUS INNOVATIVE POTENTIAL OF EUROPE ANDSET THE TONE FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKAS AN EVENT OF MUTUALBENEFIT. I EMPHASISE THAT SINCE THERE IS A STRONG TENDENCY, ESPECIALLY WHEN TALKING ABOUT IT AND DIGITAL STARTUPS, TO PRESUME THAT SILICON VALLEY HAS ALL THE ANSWERS. THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF CRITICAL ARTICLES ALONG THE LINES OF 'EUROPE NEEDS ITS OWNSILICON VALLEY'. SOME OF THIS CRITICISM IS VALID: EUROPE HAS NOT REALLY PRODUCED ITS EXPECTED SHARE OF DIGITAL 'UNICORNS' (BILLION-DOLLAR STARTUPS); SCALING AND EXITS ARE MORE DIFFICULT; VALUATIONS ARE TYPICALLY LOWER; EUROPEAN ATTITUDES TO RISK ARE MORE CAUTIOUS; EUROPE IS NOT (YET) A DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET LIKE THE US. ON MULTIPLE MEASURES OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, THE US LEADS THE WORLD. MANY EUROPEAN CITIES CAN THEREFORE LEARN MUCH FROM THE VALLEY, ADOPTING SOME CULTURAL ATTITUDES AND ADAPTING SPECIFIC INITIATIVES - JUST AS THE SEED ACCELERATOR MODEL, DEVELOPED BY Y COMBINATOR A DECADE AGO, HAS BEEN WIDELY REPLICATED ACROSS EUROPE (AND CONTINUES TO EVOLVE). YET ON THE OTHER HAND, THE QUALITY OF A STARTUP IS NOT NECESSARILY A REFLECTION OF THE RICHNESS OF THE ECOSYSTEM WHICH PRODUCED IT. AND EUROPE HAS STILL PRODUCED A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT DIGITAL STARTUPS, LIKE SKYPE, KLARNA, PREZI, SOUNDCLOUD, ZALANDO, BLABLACAR, TRIVAGO, SKYSCANNER AND ZOPA, WITH A HUGE INCREASE IN UNICORNS SINCE 2013. THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE INCREASE IN EUROPEAN UNICORNS SINCE 2013 UNFORTUNATELY, MANY GREATEUROPEAN STARTUPS ARE NOT RECOGNISED AS SUCH- IN PART BECAUSE SUCCESSFUL FIRMS OFTENEMIGRATE IN SEARCH OF EASIER FUNDRAISING AND HIGHER VALUATIONS. THIS HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT BACK HOME, REDUCING THE NUMBERS OF ROLE MODELS AND MENTORS.HOWEVER, IT IS OFTENA SENSIBLE MOVE FOR THE FIRM, GIVENTHAT THE US VENTURE CAPITAL INDUSTRY IS MUCH MORE DEVELOPED THAN EUROPE. FOR INSTANCE, DATA FROM STARTUP INTELLIGENCE FIRM FUNDERBEAM SHOWS THAT, SO FAR IN 2015, THE US HAS PRODUCED ROUGHLY TWICE AS MANY STARTUPS AS THE WHOLE OF EUROPE - BUT THOSE STARTUPS HAVE COLLECTIVELY RECEIVED AROUND 10 TIMES AS MUCH FUNDING ($62 BILLION TOTAL INVESTMENT, COMPARED WITH JUST $6.6 BILLION FOR EUROPEAN STARTUPS). THIS GAP IS A REFLECTION NOT OF QUALITY (USAND EUROPEAN TECH STARTUPS HAVE ROUGHLY THE SAME LIKELIHOOD OF A SUCCESSFULIPO), BUT OF THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE US VC INDUSTRY,ITS WILLINGNESS TO PLACE BIGGER BETS ON US FIRMS, AND THE FACT THAT MANY VCS REMAIN QUITE GEOGRAPHICALLY-FOCUSSED. IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG-TERM, THEN,DEVELOPING EUROPES STARTUP ECOSYSTEMS (IDEALLY, IN THEIR OWN WAYS, PLAYING ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS) AND GROWING THE EUROPEAN VC INDUSTRY IS CLEARLY ESSENTIAL. BUT IN THE NEARER-TERM, EUROPEAN STARTUPS NEED TO BECOME MORE VISIBLE TO AMERICAN VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS. THIS IS WHAT I HOPE SEC2SV WILL DELIVER:A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE AND QUALITY OF EUROPEAN STARTUPS AMONG US VCS, AND HENCE GREATER NUMBERS OF VCS WHO ARE PREPARED TO INVEST IN EUROPE. THIS, IN TURN, MIGHT HAVE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF STIMULATING MORE STARTUPS & SCALEUPS IN EUROPE, AND HELPING MORE GROW HERE - RATHER THAN FEELING THE NEED TO EMIGRATE TO THE US.

284	DR. HUXTABLE TO THE ER, STAT! WE'VE GOT A CLASSIC CASE OF BLOCKED POLICIES ON OUR HANDS! BY NOW, MANY OF US ASSUMED THAT THE DISTURBING SEXUAL ABUSE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST COMEDIAN BILL COSBY -- WHO PLAYED DR. HEATHCLIFF "CLIFF" HUXTABLE ON TV'S LONG-RUNNING SITCOM, "THE COSBY SHOW" -- WOULD EVENTUALLY BE PLAYED OUT IN A COURT OF LAW. WE DIDN'T EXPECT THIS SCANDAL TO TAKE A DETOUR THROUGH INSURANCE COURT, MUCH LESS INVOLVE A HOME INSURANCE POLICY. COSBY WANTS AIG'S SUIT TOSSED OR DELAYED LAST WEEK, THE 78-YEAR-OLD ACTOR, WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY AT LEAST 40 WOMEN OF HAVING DRUGGED AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THEM OVER SEVERAL DECADES, ASKED A FEDERAL JUDGE IN SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, TO DISMISS OR PUT ON HOLD A LAWSUIT FILED BY HIS HOME INSURER, AIG. IN JUNE, AIG SUED COSBY IN CALIFORNIA AND MASSACHUSETTS OVER HOME INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO HIM IN THOSE STATES. THE INSURER MAINTAINS THE POLICIES IN QUESTION COVER PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, WHICH INCLUDE DEFAMATION, EXCEPT WHEN THOSE CLAIMS ARISE FROM "SEXUAL, PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ABUSE." DEFAMATION LAWSUITS HAVE ALREADY BEEN FILED AGAINST COSBY BY TAMARA GREEN, THERESE SERIGNESE AND LINDA TRAITZ IN MASSACHUSETTS, AND BY MODEL JANICE DICKINSON IN CALIFORNIA. THE WOMEN CLAIM THEY WERE DEFAMED BY THE DENIALS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY COSBY OR HIS REPRESENTATIVES. RISK OF 'SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE' SEEN COSBY'S COUNSEL MAINTAINS THE ACTOR WOULD FACE "SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE" IF HE WERE TO HAVE TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THE WOMEN'S LAWSUITS AND AIG'S POLICY ACTION SIMULTANEOUSLY. "FORCING MR. COSBY TO FIGHT A FOUR-FRONT BATTLE WOULD DEMONSTRATE AIG'S COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF MR. COSBY," HIS LAWYERS WROTE IN A COURT FILING. "NOT ONLY DOES AIG'S ACTION BOLSTER THE UNDERLYING PLAINTIFFS, WHO WILL PERCEIVE MR. COSBY AS UNDER ATTACK EVEN FROM HIS SUPPOSED BACKERS, BUT IT SPLITS MR. COSBY'S FOCUS AND DRAINS HIS RESOURCES." AN AIG SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT, WHEN ASKED BY REUTERS. THE INSURANCE COMPANY NAMED THE 4 WOMEN AS CODEFENDANTS IN ITS ACTION, STATING THAT IT WAS SEEKING RELIEF THAT COULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THEIR DEFAMATION SUITS. THOUGH FEW OF US TAKE NOTE OF IT, DEFAMATION AND LIABILITY RISK IS GROWING WITH THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, TO THE POINT WHERE SOME INSURERS ADVOCATE SPECIAL COVERAGE FOR BLOGGERS .

285	BY DELLA MONROE IF YOU HAVE YOUR EYES SET ON A PUREBRED PET, PREPARE YOURSELF TO EVALUATE A FEW BREEDERS. JUST LIKE WHEN SHOPPING FOR A NEW SHOE, THERE ARE MANY FACTORS TO CONSIDER BEFORE DECIDING WHERE TO BUY A CAT FROM. BELOW ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES TO LOOK INTO WHEN SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT SELLER OF TICA REGISTERED RAGDOLL KITTENS . SELECTING A BREEDER WHO IS BOTH REPUTABLE AND ETHICAL IS IMPORTANT EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED THE PET YOU WANT. PERHAPS, THE FIRST TASK YOU HAVE TO ACCOMPLISH IS CREATING A LIST OF PEOPLE SELLING THEM IN YOUR AREA. FRIENDS OR RELATIVES WITH KITTENS, VETERINARIANS, AND ANIMAL SOCIETIES ARE RECOMMENDED SOURCES OF INFORMATION YOU COULD USE. IN THE WORLD TODAY, YOU DO NOT WANT TO MAKE A FINAL DECISION WITHOUT RESEARCHING ON THE INTERNET. IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT OTHER BUYERS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE SUPPLIERS YOU WANT TO BUY FROM. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BLOGS AND WEBSITES WITH REVIEWS OR TESTIMONIALS THAT YOU MAY FIND HELPFUL. MOST PEOPLE WHO BUY CATS ARE LIKELY TO POST THEIR EXPERIENCES ONLINE TO HELP OTHERS MAKE BETTER CHOICES. RAISING PETS IS NOT A BUSINESS ANYONE CAN DO TO MAKE SOME EXTRA INCOME. PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING QUALITY KITTENS MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TRAINING AND EXPERTISE THE INDUSTRY DEMANDS. YOU ARE THUS ADVISED TO ASK FOR CREDENTIALS OF A SELLER BEFORE CHOOSING THEM. YOU SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE BOTH LICENSED AND DULY REGISTERED TO OPERATE THEIR BUSINESSES IN YOUR AREA. TO AVOID REGRETS, THERE ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF BREEDERS YOU SHOULD AVOID AT ALL COSTS. THESE INCLUDE THOSE WHO ARE OFFERING KITTENS FOR OVER THE INTERNET. THE FACT THAT YOU WILL NOT GET A CHANCE TO MEET THEM AT THEIR PREMISES IS ENOUGH REASON FOR WORRY. IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO VERIFY THE QUALITY OF THE PETS THEY OFFER OR ASCERTAIN THEIR HEALTH CONDITIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO VISIT ANY SUPPLIER YOU HAVE SHORTLISTED. YOU SHOULD CALL OR WRITE TO THEM TO BOOK AN APPOINTMENT. THERE ARE MANY ISSUES TO LOOK INTO DURING SUCH VISITS, AND YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE IN A HURRY. TO HELP YOU DETERMINE THE TEMPERAMENT OF THE KITTEN YOU WANT, ASK TO SEE BOTH THEIR MOTHER AND OTHER RELATIVES. IT IS ALSO A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE SUITABILITY OF THE SURROUNDINGS. SOMETIMES A BREEDER WILL TAKE TIME TO INTERVIEW YOU ON YOUR ABILITY TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF THE ANIMAL. THIS IS A GOOD SIGN AND AN INDICATION THAT THEY ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT THE CATS. ALSO, BE KEEN ON THE FIRST IMPRESSION THEY CREATE WHEN YOU MEET THEM. DURING YOUR INITIAL MEETING, SPEND TIME TO CHAT WITH THEM AND ASK THEM WELL THOUGHT QUESTIONS AND GAUGE THEIR RESPONSES. A GOOD BREEDER SHOULD BE WILLING TO TELL YOU ABOUT ANY DEFECTS TO EXPECT WITH THE CAT YOU BUY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE HONEST ABOUT SUCH CHALLENGES AND CAN TELL YOU HOW TO MANAGE THEM. REMEMBER, A KITTEN SHOULD NOT BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENT BEFORE THEY ARE AT LEAST 10 WEEKS OLD. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: YOU CAN VISIT RITTERKATZ-RAGDOLLCATS.COM FOR MORE HELPFUL INFORMATION ABOUT TIPS ON FINDING THE RIGHT BREEDER OF TICA REGISTERED RAGDOLL KITTENS.

THE LETTER TO THE CM ALSO RAISED ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BJP FOR THE MALICIOUS ACTS OF THE POLICE AGAINST BHARTI. THE LETTER URGED KEJRIWAL TO ISSUE DIRECTIONS TO THE POLICE TO REFRAIN FROM REFERRING TO BHARTI AS AN ABSCONDER.
287	UPDATE: ANDROID MARKET SHARE STAYS STEADY IN US BUT SINKS DEEPER IN EUROPE MORE THAN A QUARTER OF SMARTPHONE BUYERS ACROSS EUROPE JUMPED SHIP FROM ANDROID TO IOS, WHICH SAW SOLID GAINS ACROSS MOST OF THE CONTINENT, SAYS RESEARCH FIRM KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH.  SO COME ON NO MORE EXCUSES, ACKNOWLEDGE YOU'RE PUTTING IT OFF AND HONESTLY ANSWER THE QUESTION "WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?" THEN REALISE IT'S AN EXCUSE AND GET STARTED, IF YOU'RE ALREADY DOING IT, GO YOU! BY LANCE WHITNEY @LANCEWHIT SEPTEMBER 2, 2015 8:03 AM PDT UPDATED: SEPTEMBER 2, 2015 8:03 AM PDT ANDROID REMAINS TOP DOG AROUND THE WORLD BUT CONTINUES TO SHED MARKET SHARE IN EUROPE. CNET ANDROID REMAINS BY FAR THE TOP MOBILE OS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, BUT ITS MARKET SHARE CONTINUES TO LOSE GROUND EXCEPT IN THE US. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY, ANDROID'S SLICE OF THE SMARTPHONE MARKET FOR THE TOP FIVE EUROPEAN NATIONS (FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, SPAIN AND THE UK) DROPPED BY 4.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 71 PERCENT FROM 75.1 PERCENT FOR THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO, KANTAR REPORTED ON WEDNESDAY. THE CHANGES IN MARKET SHARE VARIED ACROSS THE BOARD. ANDROID'S SHARE TUMBLED BY 8.7 POINTS IN GERMANY AND 5.4 POINTS IN FRANCE BUT INCHED DOWN JUST 1.5 POINTS IN ITALY AND ACTUALLY GAINED ALMOST A POINT IN SPAIN. BUT IN THE US, ANDROID'S MARKET SHARE GREW BY 1.7 POINTS TO 65.6 PERCENT FROM 63.9 PERCENT  DURING THE SAME THREE MONTHS IN 2014. THE SITUATION WAS THE REVERSE FOR APPLE'S IOS. THE IPHONE'S MARKET SHARE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY GREW BY 2.5 POINTS ACROSS  EUROPE'S TOP FIVE COUNTRIES TO REACH 17 PERCENT. APPLE'S SMARTPHONE MARKET SHARE DECLINED BY 1.3 PERCENT IN THE US, THOUGH WAS LOWER THAN THE 2.3 PERCENT DROP FOR THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS. WHY IS ANDROID LOSING GROUND IN EUROPE BUT STAYING STEADY IN THE US, WHILE APPLE'S IOS IS DOING THE OPPOSITE? THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS, CAROLINA MILANESI, CHIEF OF RESEARCH AT KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH, TOLD CNET. THE SMARTPHONE MARKET IN EUROPE IS FACING CHALLENGING CONDITIONS. CERTAIN FLAGSHIP PHONES, SUCH AS SAMSUNG'S GALAXY S6, HAVE RECEIVED A MUTED RESPONSE FROM BUYERS. ALSO, SAMSUNG AND OTHER ANDROID PLAYERS ARE FACING INCREASED COMPETITION FROM LOCAL VENDORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN CHINA. ANOTHER REASON IS THE MATURITY OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET AS EVIDENCED BY FEWER FIRST-TIME SMARTPHONE BUYERS, ACCORDING TO KANTAR. THAT TYPE OF MATURITY INCREASES THE CHURN RATE, MEANING THE RATE AT WHICH EXISTING SMARTPHONE BUYERS SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM. AND IN EUROPE, THAT  HIT ANDROID HARDER THAN IT DID APPLE.  JANOV IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND JUST KIND OF BEING EXPOSEED TO THE CONSTANT INFLUX OF NEW IDEAS AND RESEARCH HE WAS EXPOSING ME TO AND ALL THE WORK THAT WAS BEING DONE, IN THE FIELD OF EPIGENETICS AND IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL HEALTH AND NEW STUDIES HE WAS SHOWING ME ABOUT MEMORY AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE OTHER TOPICS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK REALLY STUCK WAS THIS IDEA ABOUT WHAT TO DO DURING PREGNANCY. "THIS TYPE OF MARKET MATURITY INCREASES THE IMPACT OF CHURN ON OVERALL PERFORMANCE AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH ANDROID THIS TIME AROUND -- 27 PERCENT OF SMARTPHONE BUYERS ACROSS EUROPE LEFT ANDROID FOR IOS VERSUS 9 PERCENT IN THE US," DOMINIC SUNNEBO, BUSINESS UNIT DIRECTOR AT KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH EUROPE, SAID IN A PRESS RELEASE. SWITCHING TO A DIFFERENT CARRIER TYPICALLY OCCURS LESS IN THE US THAN IN EUROPE. THAT'S BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE IN THE US ARE ON CONTRACT OR INSTALLMENT PLANS, WHILE MANY OF THOSE IN EUROPE ARE ON PREPAID PLANS, WHICH LEAD TO LONGER REPLACEMENT CYCLES. "I ALSO FEEL THAT THE 'I AM AN APPLE' AND 'I AM AN ANDROID' GROUPS ARE MORE CLEARLY DEFINED [IN THE US] THAN IN EUROPE," MILANESE ADDED. IN THE UNITED STATES, APPLE'S ANDROID RIVALS PROVIDED A TOUGHER FIGHT THAN THEY DID IN EUROPE. APPLE AND SAMSUNG STILL REIGN SUPREME IN THE US. BUT OTHER VENDORS SUCH AS LG HAVE GAINED MARKET SHARE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF NEW MOBILE DATA PLANS ON MID-RANGE PHONES, MILANESI TOLD CNET IN AUGUST. EARLY DEMAND FOR THE IPHONE IN THE US WAS STRONG, SO SALES WOULD NATURALLY BE LEVELING OFF BY THIS POINT, ESPECIALLY WITH APPLE DUE TO UNVEIL ITS NEXT IPHONE LINEUP ON SEPTEMBER 9. THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE AN OFF-YEAR FOR THE IPHONE IN WHICH APPLE INTRODUCES INTERIM MODELS -- THE IPHONE 6S AND IPHONE 6S PLUS -- WITH PERHAPS ONE OR TWO MAJOR NEW FEATURES BUT MOSTLY MINOR UPGRADES IN PROCESSOR SPEED AND A FEW OTHER FACTORS. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IPHONE SALES WILL SUFFER, ESPECIALLY IF APPLE LOWERS THE PRICE ON THE CURRENT IPHONE 6 LINEUP. "WHILE ALL EYES WILL BE ON APPLE'S NEW  PRODUCTS, I WOULD SUGGEST PEOPLE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CURRENT IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS MARKET PERFORMANCE, SHOULD THE ACCUSTOMED PRICE DROP OCCUR AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 9 PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT," MILANESE SAID. "IN THE U.S., 32 PERCENT OF THE OVERALL SALES OF THE IPHONE  5S WERE GENERATED AFTER THE LAUNCH ODF THE IPHONE 6." AND HOW DID ANDROID AND APPLE FARE ACROSS OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD? IN CHINA, ANDROID'S SMARTPHONE SHARE DROPPED BY 5.5 POINTS, WHILE THE IPHONE'S SLICE ROSE BY 5.9 POINTS. CHINA'S SMARTPHONE MARKET HAS WEAKENED AS OF LATE DUE TO OVERSATURATION, BUT THE IPHONE IS STILL A HOT DEVICE. FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, APPLE REPORTED THAT SALES IN GREATER CHINA MORE THAN DOUBLED TO $13.2 BILLION. IN AUSTRALIA, ANDROID'S SHARE PLUMMETED BY 10.5 POINTS TO 56.1 PERCENT, WHILE APPLE'S CUT ROSE BY 7.9 PERCENT TO 34.9 PERCENT.

288	SARAH CRABILL/ ALMIROLA FINISHED FOURTH, MISSING THE PLAYOFFS BY 17 POINTS. WITH A PLAYOFF BID ON THE LINE, ARIC ALMIROLA KNEW WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO SATURDAY NIGHT AT RICHMOND INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY. LINED UP BEHIND LEADER MATT KENSETH ON A RESTART WITH 18 LAPS REMAINING, ALMIROLA PLANNED TO DIVE-BOMB KENSETH INTO TURN 1 AND MUSCLE AROUND. THAT STRATEGY WAS THWARTED WHEN KENSETH TOOK OFF ON THE RESTARTED AND QUICKLY BUILT UP AN INSURMOUNTABLE ADVANTAGE. ALMIROLA WOULD FINISH FOURTH AND MISSED THE CHASE FOR THE SPRINT CUP. HAD HE WON, ALMIROLA WOULD'VE AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFIED. "WE JUST CAME UP SHORT," ALMIROLA SAID. "I AM REALLY PROUD OF ALL MY GUYS. WE WORKED OUR GUTS OUT ALL YEAR LONG AND TONIGHT WAS NO DIFFERENT. I FEEL WE HAVE OVERACHIEVED THIS YEAR AND REALLY MAXIMIZED OUR RESULTS WEEK IN AND WEEK OUT. "I AM DISAPPOINTED TO COME UP A FEW SPOTS SHORT, BUT WE GAVE IT ALL WE HAD AND THAT IS ALL WE CAN DO." NONETHELESS, ON A FAIRLY ANTICLIMACTIC NIGHT -- KENSETH LED 352 OF 400 LAPS -- ALMIROLA PROVIDED SOME RARE MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT. HE FELL A LAP DOWN WITHIN THE FIRST 100 CIRCUITS, ONLY TO GET BACK ON THE LEAD LAP VIA THE "LUCK DOG" WHEN A LAP 113 MULTI-CAR ACCIDENT OCCURRED ON THE BACKSTRETCH. FROM THERE, ALMIROLA BEGIN A STEADY CHARGE TOWARDS THE FRONT. BUT BECAUSE PAUL MENARD FINISHED 26TH, ALMIROLA'S PUSH FOR A SECOND CONSECUTIVE CHASE BERTH FELL 17 POINTS SHY OF THE FINAL POSITION. JAMIE MCMURRAY, RYAN NEWMAN, JEFF GORDON AND CLINT BOWYER ALSO CLINCHED CHASE SPOTS. "IT IS TOUGH," ALMIROLA SAID. "THIS IS WHAT WE RACE FOR -- WE RACE TO WIN RACES. WE RACE TO RUN FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP. THIS RACE TEAM, WE GOT TO DO IT LAST YEAR AND WE HAD AN ENGINE FAILURE AT CHICAGO (THE PLAYOFF OPENER) AND FEEL LIKE WE HAD A LOT MORE TO SHOW IN THE CHASE LAST YEAR. WE WANTED ANOTHER SHOT AT IT REALLY BAD." ALMIROLA'S FOURTH-PLACE WAS HIS BEST RESULT OF THE SEASON, TOPPING A FIFTH IN MAY AT DOVER INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY SPEEDWAY. NOW OUT OF THE CHASE, THE RICHARD PETTY MOTORSPORTS DRIVER IS TURNING HIS FOCUS TO ENDING THE SEASON ON A HIGH NOTE. "WE WILL GO RACE THESE LAST 10 RACES AND TRY TO GET A VICTORY," ALMIROLA SAID. "WINNING IS GOOD NO MATTER WHEN IT IS, REGARDLESS OF THE CHASE OR NOT, WE WILL TRY TO GO STINK UP THE SHOW AND GET SOME WINS IN THE LAST 10 RACES."
289	ONCE CHARLIE PARKER, DIZZY GILLESPIE, THELONIOUS MONK, BUD POWELL, CURLEY RUSSELL, MAX ROACH AND OTHER BLACK JAZZ MUSICIANS PIONEERED BEBOP AND BEGAN RECORDING THE REVOLUTIONARY STYLE IN 1945, OTHER GIFTED JAZZ ARTISTS OF THE PERIOD QUICKLY FIGURED OUT THE NEW LANGUAGE. AMONG THE MOST EXCITING AND PROFICIENT BOP GROUPS OF 1947 WAS THE SHORT-LIVED SERGE CHALOFF SEXTETTE. THE GROUP RECORDED FOUR SONGS (ENOUGH FOR TWO 78S) AND FEATURED RED RODNEY (TP), EARL SWOPE (TB), SERGE CHALOFF (BAR), GEORGE WALLINGTON (P), CURLY RUSSELL (B) AND TINY KAHN (D). FIVE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP WERE IN THE GEORGE AULD SEXTET, WHICH GIGGED IN NEW YORK BUT, SADLY, DID NOT RECORD. SWOPE WAS ADDED IN PLACE OF AULD. [PICTURED FROM LEFT, THE GEORGE CHALOFF SEXTETTE: GEORGE WALLINGTON, CURLEY RUSSELL, RED RODNEY, TINY KAHN, EARL SWOPE, TEDDY REIG (PARTIALLY HIDDEN) AND SERGE CHALOFF, COURTESY OF THE INSTITUTE OF JAZZ STUDIES] EARLIER IN '47, IN JANUARY, RODNEY HAD LED A BOP SEXTET SESSION FOR KEYNOTE, WITH CHALOFF, ALLEN EAGER (TS), AL HAIG (P), CHUBBY JACKSON (B) AND KAHN. TWO MONTHS LATER, CHALOFF PUT HIS SEXTET TOGETHER FOR SAVOY. THE RODNEY DATE IS STRONG BUT NOT NEARLY AS HAIR-RAISING, SINCE THE BAND RELIED ON AL COHN AND GERRY MULLIGAN ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH HAD A CERTAIN CIVILITY. [PHOTO OF SERGE CHALOFF ABOVE IN 1948 BY POPSIE RANDOLPH, COURTESY OF THE FRANK DRIGGS COLLECTION] ON THE SERGE CHALOFF SEXTETTE DATE, THREE OF THE FOUR SONGS RECORDED PUMPERNICKEL, SERGE'S URGE AND BAR A SECOND WERE WRITTEN AND ARRANGED BY CHALOFF WHILE THE FOURTH, GABARDINE AND SERGE, WAS BY KAHN. ALL FOUR TUNES ARE DAREDEVIL CUTE AND BLISTERINGLY FAST. THEY SHOWCASE TIGHT UNISON LINES AND STANDOUT SOLOS BY FOUR OF THE SIX MUSICIANS, WHO ARE IN SUPERB FORM. PUMPERNICKEL, FOR EXAMPLE, STARTS WITH AN IMPECCABLE PACE-SETTER BY PIANIST WALLINGTON. AFTER A BREATHLESS 16 BARS BY THE GROUP, CHALOFF SHOWS OFF HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND LEONINE APPROACH TO THE BARITONE SAX. HE'S FOLLOWING BY RODNEY ON TRUMPET, WHO IS STILL VASTLY UNDERRATED AS A SWINGING BOPPER. SWOPE'S ATTACK ON TROMBONE IS FORCEFUL AND SPIRITED, WITH A SEXY BOP SWAGGER. [PHOTO OF SERGE CHALOFF ABOVE IN 1948 BY POPSIE RANDOLPH, COURTESY OF THE FRANK DRIGGS COLLECTION] THE FOUR CHALOFF LEADERSHIP TRACKS FROM 1947 ARE TERRIFIC ENTRY POINTS FOR LISTENERS INTERESTED IN ANY OR ALL OF THE MUSICIANS INVOLVED AND BEBOP IN GENERAL. ALL I'LL SAY IS THAT THE YEARS AFTER WORLD WAR II MUST HAVE BEEN A TRIP IN NEW YORK.

292	IN THE READING ROOM AT THE UCL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION, NEWSAM LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES OVER THE LAST YEAR, I HAVE BEEN PART OF THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES TRANSFORMING ARCHIVES TRAINEESHIP AT THE UCL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION. THE FOCUS OF MY TRAINEESHIP HAS BEEN DIGITISATION AND DIGITAL PRESERVATION. BEYOND THIS, I HAVE ALSO ENGAGED IN WIDE VARIETY OF JOBS WITHIN THE TEAM, INCLUDING SEVERAL CATALOGUING PROJECTS, READING ROOM SUPERVISION, WORKING WITH VOLUNTEERS, ASSISTING IN TEACHING SESSIONS AND HELPING TO ORGANISE AND APPRAISE NEW COLLECTIONS. THIS HAS BEEN A WELL-ROUNDED AND CHALLENGING YEAR. I HAVE GAINED A REAL APPRECIATION AND UNDERSTANDING FOR THE ROLE OF THE ARCHIVIST AND FEEL WELL PREPARED FOR EMBARKING ON THE NEXT STAGE OF MY CAREER. BEFORE STARTING THE TRAINEESHIP, I WORKED IN A VARIETY OF CONTEXTS, FROM TRAINING AS A PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTER TO RUNNING A RECORD LABEL, BEFORE I ENDED UP WORKING IN LIBRARIES. I REALLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT AN ARCHIVIST DID, BUT WHEN I DISCOVERED IT AS A POTENTIAL CAREER I FELT IT WAS A PERFECT COMBINATIONOF MY INTEREST IN THE STUDY OF HISTORY AND MY LIFELONG FASCINATION WITH COLLECTIONS AND COLLECTING. FROM THIS POINT ON I WAS KEEN TO LEARN MORE AND MORE ABOUT ARCHIVES. PRIOR TO THIS ROLE, I VOLUNTEERED AT THE AHMED IQBAL ULLAH RACE RELATIONS ARCHIVE AND ARCHIVES+, BOTH IN MANCHESTER. ONE OF THE GREAT EXPERIENCES OF THIS TRAINEESHIP HAS BEEN ENGAGING WITH THE ARCHIVE MATERIALS. THE COLLECTIONS AT THE INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION HAVE OPENED UP A WHOLE AREA OF HISTORY OF WHICH I WAS PREVIOUSLY UNAWARE. WITH THE MAJORITY OF COLLECTIONS DOCUMENTING EDUCATION IN THE 20THCENTURY, THEY TELL VARIOUS STORIES ABOUT EDUCATION POLICY AND PHILOSOPHY. FROM THE IDEALISM OF OPEN AIR SCHOOLING TO THE RADICALISM OF ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE SOCIALIST TEACHERS ALLIANCE, THESE COLLECTIONS SHOW HOW EDUCATION IS A HIGHLY CONTESTED SUBJECT WHICH CAN TELL US A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT DISCUSSIONS ABOUT CHILDRENS FUTURES WERE RENDERED THROUGH MORE SUBTLE FORMS, SUCH AS HANDWRITING AND ARCHITECTURE, WHICH WERE MEANS OF CREATING ATTITUDINAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES TO HOW CHILDREN LEARNED. IT HAS BEEN A REAL PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH THIS MATERIAL ON A DAILY BASIS (I STILL CANT QUITE BELIEVE THIS IS AN ACTUAL REAL JOB THAT YOU GET PAID FOR!) AND I WILL BE MOVING ON FROM THIS ROLE CONVINCED THAT UNDERSTANDING, LOOKING AFTER AND SHARING THESE STORIES PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN OUR SOCIETY. OPEN AIR SCHOOLING AT THE GARDEN SCHOOL, 1920S (INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION, CATALOGUE REFERENCE: WF/4/249) AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS TRAINEESHIP HAS BEEN DIGITISATION AND DIGITAL PRESERVATION. THIS HAS INVOLVED A VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE AS IT WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY NEW TO ME. THE MAJORITY OF MY WORK HAS BEEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROJECT DIGITISING AN ACADEMIC JOURNAL CALLED THE EDUCATIONAL TIMES. THIS WAS PRODUCED BY AN ORGANISATION CALLED THE COLLEGE OF PRECEPTORS, ESTABLISHED IN THE MID 19TH CENTURY, WHO WERE SEEKING TO PROFESSIONALISE TEACHING BY CREATING PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND QUALIFICATIONS. THE JOURNAL SITS WITHIN A MUCH LARGER COLLECTION DOCUMENTING THIS ORGANISATION, BUT PROVIDES THE MOST CONCISE DISTILLATION OF THE ORGANISATIONS AIMS AND ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS OFFERING INSIGHT INTO THE ATTITUDES OF TEACHERS IN THIS PERIOD. THE EDUCATIONAL TIMES, VOL. 1 NO. 1, 1847 (INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION, CATALOGUE REFERENCE: COP/K/1/1) WE CHOSE THIS JOURNAL FOR TWO REASONS. FIRSTLY, BECAUSE OF ITS FRAGILITY. DUE TO ITS AGE AND THE LOW QUALITY PAPER USED, MANY PAGES ARE STARTING TO FLAKE AND THE BINDING IS STARTING TO LOOSEN. DIGITISING THE MATERIAL WILL AID THE PRESERVATION OF THESE RARE ORIGINAL COPIES BY ALLOWING USERS TO VIEW THEM PRIMARILY IN ELECTRONIC FORM. THE SECOND REASON FOR CHOOSING THIS PARTICULAR JOURNAL IS THAT WE RECEIVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF ENQUIRIES ABOUT IT. THE JOURNAL REGULARLY PUBLISHED LISTS OF RECENTLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS, WHICH ARE OF INTEREST TO BOTH ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS AND GENEALOGISTS BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC TEACHERS, WHEN THEY QUALIFIED AND WHICH SCHOOL THEY TAUGHT IN. MAKING THESE VOLUMES AVAILABLE AND FULLY SEARCHABLE ONLINE HAS ALREADY PROVED TO BE AN ASSET FOR OUR RESEARCHERS, AND HAS RESCUED THE ARCHIVISTS FROM THE OFTEN DAUNTING TASK OF TRAWLING THROUGH SEVERAL VOLUMES LOOKING FOR THAT ONE ELUSIVE NAME! I HAVE PLANNED AND MANAGED THIS PROJECT FROM THE BEGINNING, WHICH HAS REALLY BEEN IN MASTERCLASS IN DIGITISATION AND DIGITAL PRESERVATION SKILLS. FROM EARLY SCOPING AND PLANNING EXERCISES, TO CONDITION SURVEYS, TO GRAPPLING WITH FILE FORMATS AND METADATA, TO MANAGING A TEAM OF VOLUNTEERS, TO PROMOTION VIA SOCIAL MEDIA, I HAVE A ACQUIRED A VARIETY OF SKILLS WHICH I HOPE TO DEVELOP FURTHER. I WAS ALSO FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE FUNDING FROMJISC TO DEVELOP THE PROJECT FURTHER WITH COLLEAGUES FROM UCL. THIS HAS INVOLVED DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH ACADEMICS TO PROMOTE THE RESOURCE, USING SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION TECHNIQUES AND CREATING A PODCAST TO PROMOTE THE COLLECTION. THIS TRAINEESHIP HAS BEEN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN AND DEVELOP THESE SKILLS WHILE WORKING ALONGSIDE ARCHIVISTS. I HAVE GAINED A REAL APPRECIATION OF THE JOB AND TAKE WITH ME AN ENTHUSIASM AND PASSION TO THE NEXT STAGE OF MY CAREER.
293	MADISON, WIS. STRUGGLING TO GENERATE FUNDRAISING AND ENTHUSIASM, REPUBLICAN SCOTT WALKER ABANDONED HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID ON MONDAY, EXITING A TURBULENT RACE THAT SAW HIM RISE TO FRONT-RUNNER AND FALL TO AFTERTHOUGHT IN A MATTER OF MONTHS. THE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR, WHO CAST HIMSELF AS A FIGHTER AND A WINNER, PLANNED TO ANNOUNCE HIS DECISION AT A NEWS CONFERENCE MONDAY EVENING IN MADISON, BECOMING THE SECOND MAJOR GOP CANDIDATE TO QUIT THE RACE. "IT HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED TO ME THAT HE IS GETTING OUT OF THE RACE," SAID IOWA STATE SEN. BRAD ZAUN, WHO ENDORSED WALKER EARLIER THIS YEAR. "I'M PROUD OF OUR EFFORTS IN IOWA. AND I THINK HE'S AN INCREDIBLE CANDIDATE. IT'S UNFORTUNATE." ONE OF THE LAST REPUBLICANS TO ENTER THE RACE, WALKER WILL JOIN FORMER TEXAS GOV. RICK PERRY AS ONE OF THE FIRST TO LEAVE IT, HAVING BEEN UNABLE TO ADJUST TO THE POPULARITY OF BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN DONALD TRUMP OR BREAK OUT IN EITHER OF GOP'S FIRST TWO DEBATES. YET COMPARED TO PERRY, WALKER'S FALL WAS DRAMATIC. HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE A TOP-TIER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR AND BUILT A MASSIVE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION, WITH PAID STAFF SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THAT DWARFED MANY OF HIS RIVALS IN SCALE AND SCOPE. "I'M NOT SURE WHAT WENT WRONG," SAID IOWA STATE SEN. MARK COSTELLO, WHO ENDORSED WALKER EARLIER THIS YEAR. "I DON'T THINK HE MADE ANY REALLY BIG MISTAKES, BUT PEOPLE LOST ENTHUSIASM." HE WILL RETURN TO HIS JOB IN WISCONSIN AS GOVERNOR, WHERE HIS TERM RUNS THROUGH 2018. WALKER, 47, TRIED TO APPEAL TO RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES, TEA PARTY CONSERVATIVES AND THE MORE TRADITIONAL GOP BASE. HE TRIED TO CAST HIMSELF AS AN UNINTIMIDATED CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER WHO HAD A RECORD OF VICTORIES IN A STATE THAT HASN'T VOTED REPUBLICAN FOR PRESIDENT SINCE 1984. HE CAME TO THE RACE HAVING WON ELECTION IN WISCONSIN THREE TIMES IN FOUR YEARS, AND HAVING GAINED A NATIONAL FOLLOWING AMONG DONORS AND CONSERVATIVES BY SUCCESSFULLY PUSHING HIS STATE TO STRIP UNION BARGAINING RIGHTS FROM ITS PUBLIC WORKERS. WALKER POINTED TO THOSE WISCONSIN WINS, IN A STATE THAT TWICE VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA AS PRESIDENT, AS SIGNS THAT HE COULD SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE A CONSERVATIVE AGENDA AS THE GOP'S WHITE HOUSE NOMINEE. HE CALLED HIMSELF "AGGRESSIVELY NORMAL" AND CAMPAIGNED ON A HARLEY-DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE, AND MADE A SPLASH IN JANUARY WITH A WELL-RECEIVED SPEECH BEFORE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES IN IOWA. GROUPS BACKING WALKER WENT ON TO RAISE $26 MILLION, TAPPING WEALTHY DONORS WHOM WALKER HAD CULTIVATED IN HIS YEARS AS GOVERNOR AND DURING HIS SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO WIN A RECALL ELECTION IN 2012. WALKER'S PRIMARY SUPER PAC, CALLED UNINTIMIDATED, HAD JUST BEGUN SPENDING, MAKING A MAJOR PUSH IN IOWA REFLECTING THE GOVERNOR'S LAST-DITCH STRATEGY TO PLACE ALL OF HIS CHIPS ON THAT FIRST-TO-VOTE STATE. THE SUPER PAC TOLD FEDERAL REGULATORS IN A FILING FRIDAY THAT IT HAD SPENT MORE THAN $1.6 MILLION BOOSTING WALKER THIS YEAR, MOST RECENTLY ON A $50,000 MAILING TO IOWA VOTERS. BUT WALKER WAS UNABLE TO ADJUST TO TRUMP'S RISE AND REPEATEDLY HAD TROUBLE CLEARLY STATING HIS POSITION ON SEVERAL ISSUES. HE TOOK DAYS TO CLARIFY WHETHER HE SUPPORTED ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP. HE INITIALLY SHOWED INTEREST IN BUILDING A WALL BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CANADA, ONLY TO LATER LAUGH IT OFF AS RIDICULOUS. WALKER ALSO DECLARED HE WASN'T A CAREER POLITICIAN, DESPITE HAVING HELD PUBLIC OFFICE FOR 22 STRAIGHT YEARS. AFTER TRUMP, BEN CARSON AND CARLY FIORINA DISPLACED WALKER AT THE TOP OF THE POLLS, WALKER TOOK A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH, PROMISING TO "WREAK HAVOC" ON WASHINGTON. HE VOWED TO TAKE ON UNIONS AS PRESIDENT, JUST AS HE DID AS WISCONSIN GOVERNOR, OUTLAWING THEM FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS AND MAKING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY RIGHT-TO-WORK. BUT THE ANTI-UNION POLICY PROPOSAL FELL FLAT; ANNOUNCED IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE SECOND GOP DEBATE, IT WASN'T MENTIONED AT ALL BY WALKER OR ANYONE ELSE ON STAGE. WHILE ONLY TEXAS SEN. TED CRUZ AND FORMER FLORIDA GOV. JEB BUSH HAD MORE SUPER PAC MONEY AVAILABLE TO BOOST THEIR CHANCES IN THE ORIGINAL 17-PERSON 2016 REPUBLICAN FIELD, WALKER STRUGGLED TO GENERATE MONEY FOR HIS OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN. HE HAS YET TO REPORT FUNDRAISING TOTALS TO FEDERAL REGULATORS, BUT TOP FUNDRAISERS AND DONORS HAVE SAID HIS PLUMMETING POLL NUMBERS LEFT THEM STRUGGLING TO GENERATE CASH. WALKER CALLED HIS SENIOR STAFF TO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION IN MADISON ON MONDAY TO REVIEW RECENT POLLING, IN WHICH HE WAS MIRED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GOP FIELD, AND HIS CAMPAIGN'S FINANCES. "I'M DISAPPOINTED," SAID STANLEY HUBBARD, A BILLIONAIRE MEDIA MOGUL FROM MINNEAPOLIS WHO HAD BACKED WALKER'S CAMPAIGN. "HE'S A GOOD MAN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD PRESIDENT." AS WORD SPREAD OF HIS DECISION TO EXIT THE RACE, REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES IN IOWA WORKING FOR OTHER CAMPAIGNS WERE ALREADY MAKING PLANS TO CONTACT STATE LAWMAKERS WHO HAD COMMITTED TO SUPPORT WALKER. THE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR HAD ASSEMBLED A CAMPAIGN ORGANIZATION IN EVERY ONE OF IOWA'S 99 COUNTIES AND HAD A NUMBER OF STATE LAWMAKERS COMMITTED TO HIM. CLIFF HURST, ONE OF WALKER'S NEW HAMPSHIRE CO-CHAIRS, WAS ALREADY PLANNING TO SHIFT TO FLORIDA SEN. MARCO RUBIO'S CAMPAIGN. HE SAID HE KNEW ABOUT THREE DAYS AGO THAT "IT WAS OVER" AND HAD BEEN DISCUSSING AN ENDORSEMENT OF RUBIO AS OF MONDAY MORNING, BEFORE WALKER'S ANNOUNCEMENT BECAME OFFICIAL. "IT WAS PERSONALLY HARD, BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S OVER. I KNEW WHEN IT WAS OVER," HURST SAID. "I'M SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ARE @ LESS THAN 1 PERCENT THAT YOU'VE NOT GOING TO GET ANY MONEY." WALKER, ONE OF THE MOST DIVISIVE POLITICAL FIGURES IN WISCONSIN HISTORY, WILL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO REPAIRING HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH VOTERS IN HIS HOME STATE. HIS JOB APPROVAL RATINGS FELL DRAMATICALLY DURING HIS PRESIDENTIAL RUN, HITTING THEIR LOWEST MARK EVER OF 39 PERCENT IN AN AUGUST POLL CONDUCTED BY MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY. WISCONSIN STATE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER ROBIN VOS, A REPUBLICAN AND CLOSE ALLY OF WALKER'S, SAID HE "HAS AN AMAZING STORY TO TELL ABOUT WISCONSIN AND THE REFORMS WE PUT INTO PLACE." BUT VOS SAID HE SUSPECTS WALKER REALIZED HE WOULD HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME TAKING ATTENTION AWAY FROM OTHER CANDIDATES, LIKE TRUMP, WHO ARE "SUCKING UP A LOT OF THE OXYGEN."
294	PEYTON MANNING'S SUMMER WAS BOTH DAZZLING AND PERPLEXING. PRACTICES CONSISTED OF SPRINT-OUTS, ROLL-OUTS AND BOOTLEGS FROM UNDER CENTER, PLAY-ACTION PASSES FROM THE PISTOL FORMATION AND SCRAMBLES FOR FIRST DOWNS IN DEFIANCE OF HIS 39-YEAR-OLD LEGS. PRESEASON GAMES WERE FILLED WITH EMPTY BACKFIELDS AND SHOTGUN FORMATIONS THAT PRODUCED A PAUCITY OF POINTS AND PLENTY OF ANGST AMONG BRONCOS FANS AND FANTASY FOOTBALL OWNERS ALIKE. WHICH MANNING SHOWS UP SUNDAY IS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE. "THE LAST THREE YEARS HE'S BEEN HERE, THERE WERE (PRESEASON) GAMES WE DIDN'T SCORE POINTS AND WE'D COME OUT AND SCORE 35, 42 POINTS" IN THE OPENER, WIDE RECEIVER DEMARYIUS THOMAS SAID. "SO, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BY DESIGN OR NOT, BUT IT HAPPENS." IF MANNING IS CONCERNED THAT HE DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN AUGUST, HE DIDN'T SHOW IT WEDNESDAY. "HEY, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SUNDAY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM," MANNING SAID. "WE'VE GOT SOME NEW GUYS PLAYING AND WE'VE GOT SOME NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO. I'VE SAID ALL ALONG THE KEY FOR US IS TO IMPROVE THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF A GAME. "BALTIMORE'S AN EXCELLENT DEFENSE. ARE YOU GOING TO DOMINATE ALL FOUR QUARTERS? I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S EVER DONE THAT AGAINST BALTIMORE, BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WIN ENOUGH PLAYS AND BE EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO WIN THE FOOTBALL GAME." RAVENS COACH JOHN HARBAUGH SAID ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES HE'S FACING THIS WEEK AS HE PREPARES FOR THE OPENER WAS FIGURING OUT HOW BRONCOS COACH GARY KUBIAK, HIS FORMER OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WAS ADAPTING HIS SCHEME TO FIT MANNING'S SKILLS. "THE TEAMS THAT PLAY HIM IN WEEK 3 AND 4 AND 5 AND 6 AND DOWN THE ROAD WILL HAVE A BETTER FEEL FOR THAT THAN WE WILL," HARBAUGH SAID. "I'M SURE THAT THEY DIDN'T SHOW IN THE PRESEASON EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE PLANNING ON DOING." THE BRONCOS SHOWED ALMOST NOTHING IN THE PRESEASON, IN PART BECAUSE MANNING NEVER HAD PRO BOWL RECEIVERS THOMAS AND EMMANUEL SANDERS TOGETHER WITH HIM ON THE FIELD. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO USE TRAINING CAMP TO GET A FEEL FOR THE FUTURE. GENERAL MANAGER JOHN ELWAY SAID HE LIKED WHAT HE SAW IN BROCK OSWEILER, WHO'S ENTERING HIS FOURTH SEASON AS MANNING'S BACKUP. HE ALSO LIKED ROOKIE TREVOR SIEMIAN, SO MUCH SO THAT HE HAD TO KEEP THE FORMER NORTHWESTERN QB ON THE 53-MAN ROSTER RATHER THAN RISK TRYING TO SLIP HIM THROUGH TO THE PRACTICE SQUAD. MANNING MADE CAMEOS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD EXHIBITION GAMES AND DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN NINE FULL POSSESSIONS. HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PLAYED MORE AND BETTER BUT WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS PREPARATION FOR HIS 18TH NFL SEASON. HARBAUGH MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO EXPECT SUNDAY, BUT HE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF KUBIAK AND HIS TOP LIEUTENANT, RICK DENNISON, LAST YEAR, RAVENS QUARTERBACK JOE FLACCO HAD THE BEST SEASON OF HIS SEVEN-YEAR CAREER. "I'M SURE THAT PEYTON IS HAVING A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM," FLACCO SAID. "... THEY JUST HELPED ME PLAY FAST, PLAY WITH A QUIET MIND, BE CONFIDENT AND MAKE QUICK DECISIONS. I THINK THAT OUR LINE PLAYED REALLY WELL LAST YEAR UNDER THEIR PROTECTION SCHEME AND I THINK THAT HELPED OUT A TON." THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR MANNING, WHO HAS FOUR NEW O-LINEMEN, INCLUDING TWO NOVICES IN LEFT TACKLE TY SAMBRAILO AND CENTER MATT PARADIS. RAVENS RUNNING BACK JUSTIN FORSETT WENT FROM JOURNEYMAN TO PRO BOWLER IN KUBIAK'S ZONE BLOCKING SCHEME LAST YEAR, AND HARBAUGH SAID DENVER PRO BOWLER C.J. ANDERSON SHOULD BE IN FOR A SIMILARLY SPECTACULAR SEASON. "HE'S A DOWNHILL, ONE-CUT, VERY PHYSICAL GUY," HARBAUGH SAID. "DIFFERENT KINDS OF BACKS ARE GOOD IN THIS SCHEME, BUT THEY'VE GOT TWO OF THEM. RONNIE HILLMAN DOES IT DIFFERENTLY THAN C.J. DOES IT. I THINK THEY'VE GOT TWO GUYS WITH DIFFERENT STYLES THAT RUN THE SCHEME VERY WELL." NOTES: PLAYERS VOTED MANNING, DE DEMARCUS WARE AND S DAVID BRUTON JR. AS TEAM CAPTAINS. ...

299	NEW DELHI: MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS AND PLATFORM TICKETS WILL SOON GO PAPERLESS AS RAILWAYS IS PLANNING TO LAUNCH A MOBILE-BASED APPLICATION FOR THE SAME SHORTLY. PAPERLESS MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS AND PLATFORM TICKETS IN CITIES LIKE MUMBAI, DELHI, CHENNAI AND KOLKATA ARE TO BE LAUNCHED IN NEXT FEW DAYS, RAILWAY MINISTER SURESH PRABHU HERE TODAY SAID WHILE LAUNCHING THE PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING SYSTEM FOR DELHI-PALWAL SUBURBAN SECTION HERE. PRABHU ALSO LAUNCHED TWO OTHER IT-BASED INITIATIVES - CASH/SMART CARD-OPERATED TICKET-VENDING MACHINE AT THE NEW DELHI RAILWAY STATION AND A MOBILE APP FOR FREIGHT OPERATION MONITORING NAMED AS 'PARICHAALAN'. "THERE ARE ABOUT 75 LAKH PASSENGERS WHO USE MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS IN MUMBAI OUT OF OUR TOTAL 2.3 CRORE DAILY PASSENGERS," PRABHU SAID, ADDING, "SIMILARLY A GOOD NUMBER OF PASSENGERS TRAVEL ON MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS IN CHENNAI, KOLKATA AND DELHI ALSO." HE SAID THE MOVE TO GO PAPERLESS IS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S 'DIGITAL INDIA' INITIATIVE WHICH NOT ONLY SAVES THE USE OF PAPER BUT ALSO REDUCES THE LOAD ON BOOKING COUNTER. THE IT-BASED MOBILE APPLICATION FOR TICKETS WILL MAKE PAPER MANUFACTURERS UNHAPPY BUT PASSENGERS HAPPY AS IT WILL SAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR THEM, HE SAID. THE PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING SYTEM IN DELHI-PALWAL SECTION COVERS 11 STATIONS OVER 57 KM OF DISTANCE. THE APP, WHICH IS FOR BOTH ANDROID AND WINDOWS-BASED PLATFORMS, CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE OR WINDOWS STORE BY THE USER. THE APPLICATION PROVIDES NECESSARY ON-SCREEN ALERTS TO GUIDE THE PASSENGER DURING THE BOOKING PROCESS. PAYMENT FOR THE TICKET IS DONE THROUGH THE "RAILWAY WALLET" FEATURE IN THE APP. AFTER BOOKING THE TICKET, THE PASSENGER WILL GET TICKET CONFIRMATION SCREEN, WHICH WILL CONTAIN LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT THE TICKET. EARLIER, THE MOBILE APP FOR PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED BETWEEN EGMORE AND TAMBRAM SUBURBAN SECTIONS IN CHENNAI UNDER SOUTHERN RAILWAY ZONE ON A TRIAL BASIS IN APRIL. THEN IT WAS REPLICATED IN WESTERN RAILWAYS BETWEEN CHURCHGATE AND DAHANU SECTION. DEVELOPED BY THE CENTRE FOR RAILWAY INFORMATION SYSTEMS (CRIS) "UTSONMOBILE" - THE PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING FEATURE IN MOBILE APPLICATION AIMS TO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR PRINTING OF UNRESERVED TICKETS. PRABHU SAID RAILWAYS WILL SIGN AN AGREEMENT WITH ISRO FOR USING GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGY AND SATELLITE IMAGES IN THE RAIL SECTOR. AS PER PLAN, RAILWAYS WILL USE REMOTE-SENSING TECHNOLOGY AT UNMANNED LEVEL CROSSINGS TO WARN ROAD USERS AND ALSO FOR OTHER USAGE SUCH AS MAPPING OF STATIONS AND RAIL ROUTES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ISRO. HE SAID CASH/SMART CARD OPERATED TICKET-VENDING MACHINE (COTVM) WHICH WAS MADE OPERATIONAL AT THE NEW DELHI STATION WILL BE INSTALLED AT OTHER STATIONS ALSO. COTVM IS AN UNMANNED SELF-OPERATED KIOSK WHICH CAN BE USED BY PASSENGERS THEMSELVES TO BUY UNRESERVED TICKETS THROUGH CURRENCY/COINS AS WELL AS SMART CARDS. THESE KIOSKS HAVE EASY GRAPHICAL INTERFACE FOR TICKET TRANSACTION SO THAT THE USER CAN OPERATE THESE MACHINES. THE KIOSK ACCEPTS CURRENCY/COIN OF ALL DENOMINATIONS OF RS 5 AND ABOVE. THE MACHINE DOES NOT ACCEPT SOILED/CUT/GLUED/TAPED/COLORED NOTES AND ACCEPTS CURRENCY NOTES OF GANDHI SERIES. COTVMS AIMS TO REDUCE QUEUE LENGTH AT EXISTING TICKET COUNTERS BY PROVIDING AN ALTERNATE UNMANNED TICKETING SOLUTION AND MODE OF PAYMENT. PRABHU SAID BOTH PASSENGER AND FREIGHT BUSINESS ARE IMPORTANT FOR RAILWAYS AND THE 'PARICHAALAN' MOBILE APP FOR FREIGHT OPERATORS WILL HELP IN REAL-TIME DECISION-MAKING. 'PARICHAALAN', A USER-FRIENDLY APP, REPRESENTS DATA IN A PICTORIAL AND GRAPHICAL MANNER THAT IS EASILY COMPREHENSIBLE AND ALSO MAKES THE INFORMATION DYNAMIC AND CURRENT IN NATURE IN THE FREIGHT SECTOR.
