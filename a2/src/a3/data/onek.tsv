1	SUSTENIR PARTNERED WITH ILLUMITEX NOT ONLY FOR THE COMPANY'S SUPERIOR LED TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF EXEMPLARY SUPPORT AUSTIN, TX (PRWEB) SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 ILLUMITEX, INC., GREEN TECH DEVELOPER AND MANUFACTURER OF GROUNDBREAKING LED GROW LIGHT TECHNOLOGY, ANNOUNCED TODAY INITIAL STEPS IN WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIP WITH SINGAPORES LARGEST VERTICAL FARM, SUSTENIR AGRICULTURE. SUSTENIR IS AN INNOVATIVE INDOOR FARMING ENDEAVOR THAT BRINGS MUCH-NEEDED LOCAL, FRESH PRODUCE TO THE ISLAND COUNTRY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. DISSATISFIED WITH THE LED LIGHTS FROM OTHER MANUFACTURERS THAT THEY HAD BEEN USING, SUSTENIR OPTED TO PARTNER WITH ILLUMITEX NOT ONLY FOR THE COMPANYS SUPERIOR LED LIGHTING TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE EXEMPLARY SUPPORT ILLUMITEX PROVIDES ITS CUSTOMERS. THROUGHOUT THE EXPLORATORY PROCESS, WEVE RECEIVED GREAT SUPPORT FROM THE ILLUMITEX TEAM, SAYS BEN SWAN, SUSTENIR CO-FOUNDER. ILLUMITEX PROVIDES A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDING EVERY ASPECT OF URBAN FARMING. AND THE TECHNICAL ABILITIES OF THE LIGHTS ARE TERRIFIC, AS WELL THE DIMMING, THE EFFICIENCY AND THE UNIFORM LIGHT DISTRIBUTION ALL CONTRIBUTE TO A SUPERIOR PRODUCT. SUSTENIR AND ILLUMITEX EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO GROW THEIR PARTNERSHIP AS SUSTENIR EXPANDS ITS OPERATIONS INTO MAINLAND CHINA AND THROUGHOUT THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. WE WANT ILLUMITEX RIGHT BESIDE US AS WE BRING LOCAL FOOD TO RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT SOUTHEAST ASIA AND BEYOND, SAYS SWAN. ILLUMITEX CEO CHRIS HAMMELEF IS GLAD TO HEAR IT. SUSTENIR IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTAL AGRICULTURE, AS IS ILLUMITEX, SO A PARTNERSHIP MAKES SENSE. SINGAPORE IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF A LONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR COMPANIES, HE SAYS. RESIDENTS OF SINGAPORE, A HIGHLY URBANIZED COUNTRY WITH LITTLE FARMLAND, MUST IMPORT MORE THAN 90% OF THEIR FOOD. SUSTENIR AND ILLUMITEX WILL PUT A DENT IN THOSE IMPORTS BY GROWING DELICIOUS LEAFY GREENS RIGHT IN THE HEART OF A NATION KNOWN FOR ITS FLAVORFUL CURRIES AND SPICY STIR-FRIES. QUALITY OF FOOD IS A CRITICAL PART OF SINGAPOREAN CULTURE AND ITS TRULY A PRIVILEGE TO BE PART OF A TEAM HONORING THAT TRADITION, SAYS PAUL HARDEJ, ILLUMITEX VP OF HORTITECTURE LIGHTING SOLUTIONS. SUSTENIR IS ONE OF THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED VERTICAL FARMS WE HAVE WORKED WITH SO FAR. THIS FALL, SUSTENIR WILL INSTALL MORE THAN 2,100 ILLUMITEX ECLIPSE GROW LIGHTS SOME RETROFIT AND SOME NEW IN ITS 12,000-SQUARE-FOOT FARM, ALONG WITH SOPHISTICATED CONTROL SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY PLANS TO HAVE ITS FIRST HARVEST UNDER ILLUMITEX LIGHTS TO MARKET BY NOVEMBER. GROWING FOOD LOCALLY IS A MORE SUSTAINABLE WAY TO SUPPLY SINGAPORES INCREASING POPULATION WITH FRESH, NUTRITIOUS AND DELICIOUS FOOD. SUSTENIR AND ILLUMITEX BOTH RANK SUSTAINABILITY AS A MAJOR PRIORITY, AND ARE THRILLED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GREATLY REDUCE THE FOODPRINT REQUIRED TO GET GOOD FOOD ON SINGAPORES TABLES.

3	DENIS VILLENEUVE ONCE AGAIN EXPLORES MORAL QUANDARIES AND ETHICS WITH SICARIO (MEXICAN TERM MEANING HITMAN), A BRUTALLY VIOLENT AND DISTURBING FILM ABOUT CURTAILING OR FACILITATING THE INFLUX OF DRUG EMPIRE SOUTH OF THE MEXICAN BORDER BY THE CIA. JOSH BROLIN PLAYS THE SMART-MOUTHED MATT, A CIA MAN IN TOO DEEP WITH MYSTERIOUS OPERATIVE ALEJANDRO (BENICIO DEL TORO), A MAN WITH A HISTORY THAT RAISES SUSPICIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH ANTI-KIDNAPPING FBI AGENT KATE (EMILY BLUNT) MAKING HER MAIDEN VOYAGE ON A DRUG RAID TASK FORCE IN MEXICO. KATE IS THE LONE WOMAN IN A MALE TESTOSTERONE KILLING ENVIRONMENT AND SOON THE ODD ONE OUT AS SHE BECOMES MORE AN APPENDAGE THAN A PARTICIPANT IN SEVERAL OPERATIONS. THE DEEPER SHE GETS THE HARDER IT IS FOR HER TO UNTANGLE. SHE IS PRESENTED AN ESCAPE HATCH BUT CANT ESCAPE. WHY DOES SHE STAY? THAT QUESTION GOES UNANSWERED BUT THERES AN ELEMENT OF HUMAN CURIOSITY THAT COMPELS HER TO SEE THINGS THROUGH, ESPECIALLY AFTER AN EARLY MISHAP THAT HAS SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. MEXICAN MEN ARE SHOT TO BITS IF THEY BLINK OR MERELY DISPLAY A WEAPON. PROBABLE CAUSE? THATS FOR A GROUP OF DEAD WHITE GUYS CALLED THE FOUNDING FATHERS. WHEN ROGUE IS ROGUE, WHO CARES ABOUT LAW? THIS IS A PLACE FOR WOLVES, ONE CHARACTER SAYS OMINOUSLY. ITS A HAUNTING LINE, ONE THAT RINGS DEEP IN ITS OWN TRUTH AS WELL AS IN THE TONE OF ITS DELIVERY. THE FINAL SCENE SUGGESTS BUSINESS AS USUAL, A HARDENING OF A HARD LINE NORMALIZED BY ITS OWN EXISTENCE AND BY THOSE WHO SURVIVE THE SLAUGHTER. SICARIO IS A LONGER-THAN-NECESSARY EXERCISE, DISTENDED, OFTEN BARREN IN ITS ATMOSPHERE AND PACING, WHICH ONLY ACCENTUATES ITS FEELING OF DREAD AND DISCOMFORT, A STATE FURTHER ENHANCED BY JOHANN JOHANNSSONS BROODING MUSIC SCORE. KATE, A NAIVE YET EXPERIENCED FBI AGENT, MAKES ILL-ADVISED CHOICES, AND YOU FEEL THAT SHES MUCH SMARTER THAN THE FILM MAKES HER OUT TO BE. SHES TAKEN ABOUT WHEN SHES ASKED A SERIES OF PERSONAL QUESTIONS, TESTED BY AN ALL-MALE CADRE WHO SEEKS TO PUT A LAMB IN TO SHADOW A GROUP OF FOXES. IN SICARIO YOU SEE BAD NEWS COMING FROM A MILE AWAY, BUT MR. VILLENEUVES STRENGTH IS THAT HE MAKES YOU ANALYZE AND CONTEMPLATE THAT BAD NEWS BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER IT ARRIVES. HE GETS YOU TO ENTERTAIN IT, MEDITATE IN IT AND EXPLORE IT. THAT EXERCISE IS SOMETIMES WASTED HERE, AS THE EVENTS AND SCREENPLAY BY TAYLOR SHERIDAN DONT HAVE THE HEFT OR THE COHESION TO SURVIVE A TWO-PLUS HOUR DRAMA . MR. VILLENEUVES MASTERY IS IN SLOW-BURN, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND VISCERAL DRAMA THE KIND THAT OFTEN JARS AND SCARS US AND THE CHARACTERS WE WATCH. IN PRISONERS IT WAS PENETRATIVE. IN ENEMY IT WAS EERIE AND OFF-KILTER. HERE ITS TRAGIC AND OFTEN INTENSE. THERES A RUTHLESS DISPATCH ABOUT THE FILMS MOST VIOLENT EPISODES THAT ARE ESPECIALLY DISTURBING, ALTHOUGH THE MOST DISTRESSING VIOLENCE IS WHAT WE DONT SEE ONSCREEN IN ONE FRIGHTENING AND DEVASTATING SCENE. THIS SCENE MUST HAVE PRESENTED THE DIRECTOR WITH AN ETHICAL CHOICE OF HIS OWN AS A FILMMAKER: DOES HE DISPLAY THE VIOLENCE AS IT HAPPENS AFTER SHOWING SO MANY ONSCREEN KILLINGS, OR IS IT COPOUT CENTRAL IF HE EMPLOYS RESTRAINT TO MAKE A LARGER POINT? I WISH I COULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND SICARIO, BUT ITS POWER IS BLUNTED BY RELATIVELY STERILE PERFORMANCES, NOTABLY (PARDON THE PUN) MS. BLUNTS, AND A ROUTINE ONE FROM MR. BROLIN, WHOSE MATT IS TOO MUCH A COCKY CARDBOARD PIECE ON THIS FILMS VIOLENT CHESSBOARD OF MOVE AND COUNTERMOVE. MR. DEL TORO HOWEVER, IS THROUGHLY ARRESTING AND UNNERVING. HE PERCOLATES SUPERBLY AT TIMES, WHILE MAINTAINING THE MOST MELLOW DEMEANOR IN A FILM OF SUCH CARNAGE. THAT SAID, SICARIO IS AGGRESSIVELY PSYCHOLOGICAL IF THAT MAKES SENSE SUCH IS THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE END WILL LOOK LIKE FOR ALL OF THOSE TANGLED IN ETHICAL MORASSES. THERES A REMOTENESS TO THE FATES OF SOME CHARACTERS, SATELLITES TO A DRUG WAR THATS A TRUE FACADE. THIS ISNT ABOUT WINNING AND LOSING. ITS ABOUT CONTROL AND PROTECTION, NOT ENDING THE SCOURGE OF DRUGS. YET ONE CHARACTER LECTURES ABOUT GETTING 20% OF A POPULATION TO STOP SNORTING DRUGS. ITS A LINE FULL OF DECEIT AND SELF-DELUSION. IT ISNT THE POPULATION THATS AT FAULT ITS THE CORRUPT ELEMENTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO STAND TO MAKE A MONETARY KILLING TO PRESERVE THE TRADE, A TRADE THEY WILL DO ANYTHING ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING TO UPHOLD. ITS A BLOODY HOLE THAT HAS NO BOTTOM AND NO ESCAPE, UNLESS THAT ESCAPE IS SELF-INFLICTED OR AT THE HANDS OF AN UNHOLY ACTOR. THE TRUTH IS THAT IN SICARIO NO ONE HAS THE ANSWERS, EVEN THOSE WHO ARE SURE THEY DO. THE TRICK OR CHALLENGE IS LEAVING THE AUDIENCE TO DECIDE IF AMONG ALL THE UNCLEAN HANDS THERE WERE A PAIR OF HANDS WHO DID ANY SEMBLANCE OF THE RIGHT THING. MR. VILLENEUVE JUST ABOUT SUCCEEDS, BUT IM NOT SURE THE EFFORT WAS MERITED BY A FILM THAT MEANDERS AND DRIFTS LONGER THAN IT SHOULD. ALSO WITH: DANIEL KALUUYA, VICTOR GARBER, BERNARDO P. SARACINO, HANK ROGERSON, JON BERNTHAL, MAXIMILIANO HERNANDEZ, RAOUL TRUJILLO, JULIO CEDILLO, JEFFREY DONOVAN. SICARIO IS RATED R BY THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA FOR STRONG VIOLENCE, GRISLY IMAGES, AND LANGUAGE. THE FILMS RUNNING TIME IS TWO HOURS AND ONE MINUTE. THE FILM IS IN ENGLISH AND OCCASIONAL SPANISH LANGUAGE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. OMAR P.L. MOORE IS THE EDITOR OF THE POPCORN REEL MOVIE REVIEW WEBSITE.

5	A CRUSH AT THE ANNUAL HAJJ PILGRIMAGE TO THE HOLY CITY OF MECCA HAS KILLED MORE THAN 700 PEOPLE. THE DEADLIEST DISASTER TO HIT THE SACRED PILGRIMAGE IN 25 YEARS HAS KILLED 717 PEOPLE AND INJURED 863, ACCORDING TO SAUDI ARABIA OFFICIALS. THE TRAGEDY HAS LEFT SHOCKED MEMBERS OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY CALLING FOR A CLEAR EXPLANATION OF WHAT WENT WRONG. THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES IN YORKSHIRE ARE NOW WAITING FOR NEWS FROM THEIR LOVED ONES WHO HAD MADE THE JOURNEY. A BRADFORD WOMAN IS REPORTED TO HAVE DIED ON THE PILGRAMAGE BUT THIS WAS NOT CONNECTED TO THE STAMPEDE. BRADFORD WESTS MP NAZ SHAH POSTED ON TWITTER THIS EVENING THAT SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN CONFIRMATION THAT IT WAS AN UNRELATED DEATH. SOME TWO MILLION PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE WORLD TAKE PART IN THE FIVE-DAY PILGRIMAGE WHICH BEGAN ON TUESDAY. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT AROUND 25,000 BRITISH NATIONALS HEAD OVERSEAS FROM THE UK TO SAUDI ARABIA FOR THE HAJJ, ZULFI KARIM OF THE BRADFORD COUNCIL FOR MOSQUES SAID BETWEEN 5,000 TO 7,000 PEOPLE FROM THE CITY WERE AT THE EVENT. HE SAID: WE ARE HOPING AND PRAYING FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM THE CITY OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT AND WE ARE LIAISING WITH THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND THE TOUR COMPANIES. THE COUNCIL IS SETTING UP A HELPLINE FOR RELATIVES. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF ANY OF THE DEAD ARE BRITISH BUT FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND SAID THE FOREIGN & COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (FCO) IS BOLSTERING THE SIZE OF ITS TEAM ON THE GROUND AS IT SEEKS TO URGENTLY GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT BRITISH NATIONALS WHO MAY REQUIRE ASSISTANCE. HE SAID: I WAS SADDENED TO HEAR OF THE ENORMOUS LOSS OF LIFE IN MECCA. MY THOUGHTS ARE WITH FAMILIES AND VICTIMS AT THIS DIFFICULT TIME. SUCH A SIGNIFICANT TRAGEDY WILL AFFECT MUSLIMS ACROSS THE WORLD WHO TAKE PART IN THE HAJJ PILGRIMAGE. FCO STAFF ARE IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE SAUDI AUTHORITIES AND TOUR OPERATORS, AND ARE CHECKING HOSPITALS AND OTHER LOCATIONS. THE CRUSH HAPPENED IN A MORNING SURGE OF PILGRIMS AT AN INTERSECTION OF STREET IN MINA, A LARGE VALLEY ABOUT THREE MILES EAST OF MECCA. THE FCO HAS URGED WORRIED RELATIVES IN THE UK TO CONTACT THE ITS SWITCHBOARD ON 020 7008 1500. BRADFORD MAN ILYAS MASTER, A TOUR OPERATOR WITH OMARY AGENCY, WHICH IS BASED IN THE CITY, IS LEADING A PARTY OF 225 BRITONS WHO MADE THE JOURNEY TO SAUDI ARABIA. SPEAKING TO THE YORKSHIRE POST FROM THE HOLY CITY, HE SAID: IN MY GROUP EVERYONE IS SAFE AND WELL. IT HAPPENED IN A DIFFERENT AREA WHERE THERE ARE HARDLY ANY BRITISH PEOPLE. AS WE WERE WALKING TOWARDS THE JAMRAAT AREA WE NOTICED A HELICOPTER IN THE SKY AND AN AMBULANCE SIREN, THEN WE REALISED SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED. EVERYONE IS SHOCKED. THERE IS A NETWORK PROBLEM BUT MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN THE UK. WHEN ASKED IF HE AGREED WITH THE SAUDI HEALTH MINISTER KHALED AL-FALIH, WHO BLAMED UNRULY PILGRIMS FOR CAUSING THE CRUSH, MR MASTER REPLIED: THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST BUT ON A SMALL LEVEL. THE SAUDI MINISTER IS RIGHT, PEOPLE DO NOT FOLLOW THE RIGHT GUIDELINES. THE SAUDI ARABIAN AUTHORITIES DO THEIR BEST TO SERVE THE HAJIS. EACH YEAR PILGRIMS PAY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS TO GO ON THE TRIP WHICH ALL BELIEVERS WHO CAN AFFORD IT ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ONCE, WITH PEOPLE SPENDING BETWEEN 4,000-5,000 FOR A TYPICAL PILGRIMAGE. AMATEUR VIDEO AND PICTURES ON SOCIAL MEDIA SHOWED IMAGES OF DEAD BODIES ON THE GROUND DRESSED IN THE SIMPLE TERRY CLOTH GARMENTS WORN DURING THE HAJJ. OTHER PICTURES SHOW PEOPLE SITTING IN WHEELCHAIRS AND BEING TREATED. PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON TWEETED: MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THE FAMILIES OF THOSE KILLED AT THE HAJJ PILGRIMAGE. A MESSAGE ON BEHALF OF CRICKETER-TURNED-POLITICIAN IMRAN KHAN SAID HE WAS DEEPLY SADDENED TO LEARN OF THE STAMPEDE. IT ADDED: MAY ALLAH GRANT THE MARTYRS A PLACE IN HEAVEN. PRAYING FOR THE INJURED IN MINA STAMPEDE AND FOR THE SAFE RETURN OF ALL THE HAJIS. THE TRAGEDY HAPPENED AS MUSLIMS AROUND THE WORLD CELEBRATED THE KEY FESTIVAL OF EID AL-ADHA. MOHAMMED ADREE SHARIF, , SAID HE WAS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED BY THE DEATHS AS THE EVENT HAD SEEMED TO BE WELL ORGANISED. HE TOLD ITV NEWS: WE HAD HEARD ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPENING IN THE PAST. THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING DIFFERENT LEVELS AND A LOT OF MONEY BEING SPENT BY THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT WAS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE PILGRIMS. TODAY PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CELEBRATING EID AS WELL AND YET NO ONE IS REALLY CELEBRATING HERE - WE ARE JUST WANDERING AROUND IN SHOCK AND THINKING FOR THE GRACE OF GOD, IT COULD HAVE BEEN US. EID AL-ADHA IS KNOWN AS THE FEAST OF THE SACRIFICE AS IT RECALLS ABRAHAMS WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE HIS SON IN OBEDIENCE TO ALLAH. IT IS THE WORST TRAGEDY TO HIT HAJJ IN 25 YEARS AND COMES JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER A GIANT CONSTRUCTION CRANE CAME CRASHING DOWN ON THE GRAND MOSQUE IN THE SAUDI CITY OF MECCA, THE FOCAL POINT OF THE HAJJ. SAUDI AUTHORITIES DEPLOYED ABOUT 100,000 SECURITY FORCES THIS YEAR TO OVERSEE CROWD MANAGEMENT AND ENSURE PILGRIMS SAFETY.

PHOTO: JESSICA HROMAS WE ALL EXPECTED SOMEAMUSING TWEETS DURING LAST NIGHT'SFINAL EPISODE OF THE BACHELOR AU , BUT I DOUBT ANY OF US EXPECTED MOST OF THOSE AMUSING TWEETS TO COME FROM NSW PREMIER MIKE BAIRD. AND YET, THIS IS A THING THAT HAPPENED. JUST AS THE SEASON FINALE WAS GETTING UNDERWAY, BAIRD TWEETEDTHAT HE WAS STUCK AT HOME "WITH THE MAN-FLU", AND THAT HIS DAUGHTERS HAD COMANDEERED THE TV TO FIND OUT WHETHER BACHIE SAM WOULD GIVE HIS FINAL ROSE TOSNEZANA OR LANA. BACHELOR SAM WOOD AND NEW LOVE, SNEZANA MARKOSKI. PHOTO: CHANNEL TEN "IT'S GOING TO BE A LOOOONG NIGHT," HE WROTE. STUCK AT HOME ON THE COUCH WITH MAN-FLU.

WELL, LIVE-TWEET THE WHOLE THING, OF COURSE. AND SO HE DID, IN AN EPIC ONE-AND-A-HALF HOUR TWEETING SESSION, FILLED WITH BEMUSED HILARITY, FATHERLY ADVICE, THE REVELATION THAT HIS DEPUTY GLADYS BEREJIKLIAN WAS A LONGTIME FAN, AND A FEW CRUEL DIGS AT HOST OSHER GUNSBERG'S HAIR. AS THE INTERNET SAID, SNEZ MAY HAVE WON THE BACHELOR'S HEART, BUT MIKE BAIRD WON THE BACHELOR FINALE. HE SEEMS VERY SINCERE FOR A GUY WHO IS TWO-TIMING, LIVE ON TV.

LIKE MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEYBEFORE HIM, CRAIG DAVID IS SET TO RISE OUT OF THE BARGAIN BIN OF POP CULTURE TO BECOME AN EVEN BIGGER FORCE THAN BEFORE.AFTER THAT KURUPT FM SESSION THE OTHER WEEK WHERE HE WENT IN HARDLAYING BARS FROM"FILL ME IN" OVER JUSTIN BIEBER ANDJACK 'S"WHERE ARE NOW"THE WORLD, FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER HIS FIRST NUMBER ONE, IS FINALLY READY TO ACCEPT CRAIG DAVID ON HIS OWN TERMS .

8	EACH DAY WE SEE THE EFFORT OF UNIONS TO FORCE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY FARM WORKERS TO PAY BRIBES TO WORK. THEN YOU HAVE THE EFFORT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES ARE FORCING WORKERS TO SPEND MORE ON WORKING CONDITIONS. THEN YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR FARMS, ESPECIALLY IF A NEW PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS. THE SOLUTION IS ROBOTS AND MACHINES TO DO THE PICKING AND HARVESTING OF CROPS. WHILE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP THE NEW MACHINES, THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SO. YEARS AGO UC DAVIS DEVELOPED A TOMATO PICKING MACHINEBUT THE UNIONS STOPPED ITS DEVELOPMENT. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. AGAIN, AMERICA CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN AGRICULTURE INTERNATIONALLY. WE CAN INNOVATE AND FEED THE HUNGRY MASSES BY MAKING FOOD AVAILABILITY MORE RELIABLE AND LOW COST. 4 LABOR-INTENSIVE CROPS FARMERS WISH THEY HAD ROBOTS TO HARVEST ELIZA BARCLAY, KPBS, 9/7/15 THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION SAYS MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO PICK HOT AND BELL PEPPERS COULD HELP SOLVE LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEMS. IF YOURE ENJOYING A LATE-SUMMER FRUIT PIE THIS LABOR DAY, CONSIDER WHAT WENT INTO GROWING AND HARVESTING THAT FRUIT. CHANCES ARE, IT TOOK A LOT OF HUMAN HANDS TO ENSURE ITS SKIN WOULD BE PERFECT AND SMOOTH WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT. WHILE MACHINES HAVE REPLACED HUMAN HANDS FOR A LOT OF FARM JOBS THE HARVESTING OF TOMATOES FOR PROCESSING, THE CUTTING OF LETTUCE AND SPINACH, THE SHAKING OF ALMOND TREES TO MAKE THE NUTS FALL TO THE GROUND MANY FRUIT, VEGETABLE AND NUT FARMERS STILL RELY HEAVILY ON PEOPLE TO PLANT, MAINTAIN AND HARVEST THEIR CROPS. MACHINES DONT YET EXIST FOR THESE CROPS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN AMPLE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK, AND BECAUSE ITS HARD TO DESIGN MACHINES THAT CAN CUT OR PICK THE FRUIT OR VEGETABLES WITHOUT SQUISHING OR DAMAGING THEM TOO MUCH. BUT AS IMMIGRATION POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE GOTTEN STRICTER AND MIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO THE U.S. HAS SLOWED SINCE 2008, THE FARM LABOR SUPPLY HAS GOTTEN TIGHT. THOUGH WAGES HAVE RISEN AND SOME FARMERS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR ACREAGE, SOME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES ROTTING IN THEIR FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CANT FIND ANYONE TO PICK IT. THE WORK IS OFTEN BACK-BREAKING AND RISKY WORKERS WHO HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS TO REACH CHERRIES, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY FALL AND INJURE THEMSELVES. AND SO SOME WORKERS HAVE FOUND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE. ALL THATS CREATED A NEW PUSH FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO MECHANIZATION TO REPLACE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME FILLING. THERES AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF FRESH-MARKET FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS, MATTHEW WHITING , AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AND EXTENSION SPECIALIST AT WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEET CHERRY INDUSTRY, TELLS THE SALT. THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED HARVEST LABOR IS ON EVERY GROWERS MIND. FOR LABOR DAY, WE THOUGHT WED ROUND UP SOME OF THE CROPS THAT CANT YET BE HARVESTED BY A MACHINE, BUT THAT MAY BE IN THE FUTURE. TO BE CLEAR, THE ISSUE OF FARM LABOR IS COMPLICATED. AND MACHINES THAT COULD HARVEST THESE CROPS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE. SWEET CHERRIES THESE ARE THE SOFT, SWEET CHERRIES WE GET IN BAGS WITH THE STEM ATTACHED. AND WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND PLUMP? BECAUSE A HUMAN HAND CAREFULLY PICKED THEM. BUT THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER WILLING HANDS TO DO THAT WORK. AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOTICED. OF ALL THE PRODUCERS THAT DREAM OF MECHANICAL HARVESTERS TO EASE THEIR LABOR WOES, THE SWEET CHERRY GROWERS MIGHT BE THE CLOSEST TO GETTING ONE THANKS TO RESEARCH FUNDING. MATT WHITING SAYS HE AND OTHERS AT WSU ARE CLOSE TO FINDING A COMMERCIAL PARTNER FOR A PROTOTYPE HARVESTER THAT CAN PICK 50 TIMES AS MANY CHERRIES AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD IN THE SAME TIME. STILL, THERES ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS NEW MODEL IS VIABLE: NEW VARIETIES OF CHERRIES SUITED TO THE MECHANICAL HARVESTER WILL NEED TO BE BRED. WHITING SAYS RESEARCH IS HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT IN 10 TO 12 YEARS, SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER GROWERS A SUITE OF NEW VARIETIES. ASPARAGUS AS THE HUFFINGTON POST HAS REPORTED , ASPARAGUS IS UNIQUELY LABOR INTENSIVE BECAUSE THE QUICK-GROWING PLANT MUST BE HARVESTED EVERY DAY OF ITS THREE-MONTH GROWING SEASON. EACH PLANT SPROUTS MULTIPLE SPEARS (THE PART OF THE PLANT WE EAT) A DAY, WHICH HAVE TO BE HAND-CUT EVERY DAY. SO THAT MEANS WORKERS ARE CUTTING 14 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FROM ROUGHLY FEBRUARY TO MAY. BUT VARIOUS MECHANICAL ASPARAGUS HARVESTERS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING THEM. ACCORDING TO A 2009 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT , IF THE U.S. ASPARAGUS INDUSTRY IS TO INSURE A COMPETITIVE POSITION, IT MUST SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGY FOR LABOR TO LOWER PER UNIT COSTS AND SHIFT THE WORKFORCE TO VALUE-ADDED EMPLOYMENT. INSTITUTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW. APPLES COMMERCIAL APPLE PICKING TODAY REQUIRES BRAWN WORKERS HAVE TO FILL BUCKETS ALL DAY LONG WITH HEAVY APPLES AND THEN DUMP THEM INTO BINS. AND ACCORDING TO A FRUIT INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION , THE ERA OF FULLY AUTOMATED ROBOTIC HARVESTERS NAVIGATING [APPLE] ORCHARD ROWS IS STILL YEARS AWAY. WHITING SAYS THATS BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS DEDICATED LITTLE FUNDING DEDICATED TO RESEARCH. THATS CHANGING, THOUGH. THE WASHINGTON STATE TREE FRUIT RESEARCH COMMISSION IS NOW PURSUING MORE RESEARCH ON MECHANICAL HARVESTING. AND THIS YEAR, SOME COMMERCIAL APPLE FARMERS MAY BE USING A VACUUM HARVESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME. ITS DESIGNERS SAY IT SAVES TIME, REDUCES PICKER FATIGUE AND BOOST THE HARVEST YIELD. PEPPERS CALIFORNIA GROWS ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE PEPPERS IN THE U.S., AND LATELY THE CALIFORNIA PEPPER COMMISSION HAS BEEN TALKING MORE DEVELOPING MECHANICAL HARVESTING AND VARIETIES BRED TO BE PICKED BY MACHINES. ACCORDING TO A 2015 REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION, WITH INCREASING COST AND DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF LABOR NEEDED TO PICK PEPPERS, INNOVATION [SIMILAR TO THE PROCESSED TOMATO INDUSTRY] COULD GIVE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. FARMERS SIGNIFICANT RETURNS AND POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PEPPER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA, THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO HAVE FRESH MARKET QUALITY AND MECHANICAL HARVESTING IN BOTH BLOCKY [BELL PEPPERS] AND HOT TYPES.

11	REVISE. KR: RIGHT, THE FETUS CONSTANTLY ADAPTS TO THE WOMB ENVIRONMENT AND PAYS THE PRICE FOR IT. THE FIRST ORDER IS SURVIVE AT ALL COSTS. THEN IF WERE FORTUNATE LATER, POSSIBLY THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO GO BACK AND TAKE CARE OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS, AND ALSO ITS THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO. NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL THEIR PAIN, NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL TERROR OR ANYTHING UNPLEASANT REALLY. THATS WHAT OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE ABOUT, DISTRACTING OURSELVES IN A THOUSAND WAYS FROM ALL THIS PAIN WERE CARRYING AROUND, WHICH KEEPS RELENTLESSLY SURGING TO BE MADE CONSCIOUS. DR. JANOV WRITES, THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA WHILE BEING CARRIED AND IN CHILDHOOD DIE IN AVERAGE TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THOSE RISK FACTORS. SO HERE THIS IS A GOOD ARGUMENT, FOR UNDERSTANDING AND RELIVING AND FEELING OUR PAIN, AND POSSIBLY EVEN HEALING BIG SECTIONS OF OUR HEARTS AND SOULS THAT ARE THERE WAS AN OLD BOOK THAT HE WROTE CALLED PRISONERS OF PAIN. THAT WERE ALL KIND OF HUGGED TIED BY OUR PAIN AND THE REPRESSION THAT WE USE TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT. JL: RIGHT, AND I THINK THIS CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF AFFECTS TOO IN TERMS OF HOW WE REPRESS OR HOW WE TRY TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE JUST AS BAD IF WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DIG PAST THE PAIN OR REPRESS IT THAT CREATES ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM, WHICH CAN THEN SHOW UP IN OTHER WAYS. THERE HASNT BEEN A LOT OF DEFINITIVE RESEARCH ON THIS, BUT DR. JANOV REALLY BELIEVES THAT THIS ALSO MAY BE BEHIND WHAT EVENTUALLY CAUSES CANCER, THIS SORT OF MASSIVE REPRESSION ON THE CELLULAR LEVEL THAT PREVENTS NATURAL GROWTH AND THEN OVERTIME CREATES CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES. KR: ID LIKE TO READ ANOTHER SHORT SECTION HERE, DR. JANOV WRITES, WHAT MOST OF MEDICINE PSYCHOTHERAPY INVOLVES TODAY IS THE TREATMENT OF FRAGMENTS OF THE HUMAN BEING. WE THEN GO ABOUT TREATING THE VARIED OFFSHOOTS FROM A CENTRAL IMPRINT, RATHER THAN THE IMPRINT ITSELF. TREATMENT BECOMES INTERMINABLE, WHAT WE GET IS A FRAGMENT OF PROGRESS, A CHANGE IN ASPECTS OF AN EARLY EXPERIENCE, RATHER THAN A HOLISTIC RECALIBRATION OR NEURO AND PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS CONNECTED WITH THE EXPERIENCE. JL: RIGHT. I THINK THATS REALLY TO KIND OF TAKE THAT AND KIND OF GO TIED IN WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYING COMPARISONS HE DRAWS IN BOOK TO SOMEBODY LIKE FREUD, THE RELATIONSHIP HE HAS WITH SOME OF THE EARLIER SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT PRECEDED HIM IS COMPLICATED. FREUD HE HAD THIS NOTION THAT HYSTERIA WAS ROOTED IN REPRESSED SEXUAL DESIRE AND HE OFTEN CHARTED IT IN DREAMS AND SORT OF THIS SYMBOLIC NOTION OF DREAMS. I THINK WHAT JANOV REALLY DOES IS HE TAKES, MUCH LIKE THOSE I THINK, THINKERS WHO DWELLED IN BIG IDEAS AND SORT OF PROFOUND CONCLUSIONS, HE SORT OF NOTES THAT WHILE FREUD WAS WORKING ON THE SYMBOLIC LABELS AND MISSED A LOT, HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS. INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOW THIS HYSTERIA WOULD CONSTANTLY BE UNREFLECTIVE AND PRONE TO OVERREACTION, AND JANOV WOULD SAY THAT YES THESE TRAITS EXIST, BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR SYMBOLS IN DREAMS, HELL LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF WHATS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN WERE HAVING NIGHTMARES. WHATS HAPPENING TO US BIOLOGICALLY WHEN WE HAVE A NIGHTMARE, OR WHAT DO WE FEEL DURING THAT TIME, AND WHY IS THAT TERROR COMING UP. HELL LOOK TO THE LIMBIC SYSTEM TO FIND WHERE THE TERROR IS ACTUALLY ROOTED. HES NOT TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THATS GOING TO CALM DOWN A PATIENT WHO HAS ADD OR DEPRESSION FOR THE DAY OR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. EVEN SOMETHING THAT MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO, HES REALLY LOOKING TO SOMETHING THAT CAN EVENTUALLY PROMOTE A CURE. KR: IM GOING TO READ ONE MORE PARAGRAPH OK? ON MY END DR. JANOV WRITES, THE BRAIN WE NEED TO ADDRESS DOESNT TALK, DOESNT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT DOESNT UNDERSTAND WORDS. IN FACT, THE TERM UNDERSTAND IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER, WE ARE NOT AFTER UNDERSTANDING IN THE INTELLECTUAL SENSE OF THE TERM, WE ARE AFTER INTEGRATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT CEREBRAL UNDERSTANDING. YES, UNDERSTANDING HELPS, BUT IT MUST NOT BE CONFUSED WITH RESOLVING, CONNECTING AND INTEGRATING. WHEN A THERAPIST TRIES TO GET A PATIENT TO REPORT ON HIS FEELINGS ALL MAY BE LOST, FOR THOSE FEELINGS MAY BE WORDLESS. TRYING TO EXPRESS THEM VERBALLY DISTANCES US FROM THE ORIGINS OF OUR PAIN IN THE LOWER BRAIN, AND SINCE LAYER OF BRAIN TISSUE CANNOT DO THE WORK OF ANOTHER WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY TRUMPED OR EFFORTS, ONCE WE GET AWAY FROM WORDS WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT IS CURATIVE. UNDERSTANDING CAME LAST IN HUMAN EVOLUTION, LONG AFTER FEELING, AND IT WILL NOT LEAD US TO THE LONG TERM HEALING WE ARE AFTER. NONE OF THIS REQUIRES ABSTRACT OR ESOTERIC METHODS, WE CAN MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN SOCIETY JUST BY PAYING ATTENTION TO GESTATION AND CHANGING OUR BIRTH PRACTICES. JL: RIGHT, AND I MEAN I THINK THATS ONE OF THE BOOKS KEY CONCLUSIONS, IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT BIRTH PRACTICES AND LOOK AT A MOTHERS EMOTIONAL STATE AS NOT JUST NOT AT ALL I THINK THE IDEA THAT FEELING IS CONNECTED TO OUR BIOLOGY AND HAS THESE SORT OF BIOLOGIC IMPLICATIONS, WE CAN SEE IT IN OUR BIOLOGY IS A PRETTY DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE FIELD. A FIELD THAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY TALK THERAPY AND BY APPROACHES REALLY FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS, NOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN. THATS WHERE I THINK DR. JANOV IS REALLY LOOKING TO GO. KR: WELL, IT EXCITES ME BECAUSE I THINK IT OPENS A HUGE DOOR. I THINK IT OPENS AN ENORMOUS DOOR OF UNDERSTANDING AND OF SUGGESTING VERY FUNDAMENTAL, NONE ESOTERIC, AS HE SAYS, SIMPLE BIRTH PRACTICES, PRACTICES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILD BIRTHING THAT CAN HAVE THE MOST DRAMATIC AND FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR HUMAN FUTURE. IT CAN PROBABLY DO MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE BILLABLE HOURS IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROFESSION. JL: YES, I THINK THERE WAS A CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK THAT CAME ABOUT LATER SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH PREGNANCY, AND I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME WORKING WITH DR. JANOV IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND JUST KIND OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE CONSTANT INFLUX OF NEW IDEAS AND RESEARCH HE WAS EXPOSING ME TO AND ALL THE WORK THAT WAS BEING DONE, IN THE FIELD OF EPIGENETICS AND IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL HEALTH AND NEW STUDIES HE WAS SHOWING ME ABOUT MEMORY AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE OTHER TOPICS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK REALLY STUCK WAS THIS IDEA ABOUT WHAT TO DO DURING PREGNANCY. AND HE ENDED UP SORT OF WRITING A CHAPTER ON PREGNANCY AND JUST OFFERING SOME ALMOST CONCRETE PIECES OF ADVICE FOR WOMEN THAT CAN HAVE SOME REALLY LASTING IMPLICATIONS. AS HE WRITES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OXYMORON FOR ME TO GIVE ADVICE SINCE I AM NOT BY PROFESSION NOR INTENTION AN AFICIONADO OF ADVICE. BUT LET US NOT MINIMIZE WHAT A CARRYING MOTHER CAN DO FOR THE GOOD OR BAD OF HER CHILD. IT IS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THAT HE APPROACHES THE SUBJECT, BECAUSE HE IS MALE AND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT IF YOURE SORT OF PROVIDING SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOW IT BEHAVED. BUT THINGS LIKE WATCHING YOUR STRESS; IF I CAN READ JUST A COUPLE PARTS OF THIS CHAPTER I THINK ITS REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE IS NO WAY TO ELIMINATE STRESS ENTIRELY, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS TO MANAGE IT. DONT PLAN A NEW BUSINESS OR START A SERIES OF COMPLICATED PROJECTS THAT PUT YOU UNDER STRESS WHILE PREGNANT. THE BABY WILL FEEL THIS ANXIETY AND SUFFER. TRY TO WORK OUT PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SPOUSE BEFORE YOU GET PREGNANT. ONCE YOU ARE PREGNANT, IT IS LARGELY TOO LATE. THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD NEVER ARGUE OR FIGHT AGAIN; BUT TRY TO RESOLVE THE MORE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES BEFORE YOU INTRODUCE A NEW LIFE ON THIS PLANET. THE BABY DESERVES HIS OR HER BEST CHANCE AT LIFE, AND WHAT YOU DO DURING PREGNANCY TO MANAGE YOUR STRESS IS IMPORTANT, IN THAT REGARD. HE TALKS ABOUT EATING RIGHT AND GETTING PROTEIN, CALCIUM, FOLIC ACID, FIBER. HE TALKS ABOUT BEING VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GOING ABOUT TRANQUILIZERS AND PAINKILLERS TO RELIVE ANXIETY. NEW STUDIES ARE COMING OUT ALL THE TIME ON THIS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NEW STUDIES ON THE USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS, THE USE OF TRANQUILIZERS DURING PREGNANCY, AND WERE STILL KIND OF FIGURING OUT WHAT ALL THIS DOES, ULTIMATELY IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE MOTHER TO KEEP HER EMOTIONS BALANCED BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO SEE WHAT OTHER EFFECTS THIS COULD HAVE DURING GESTATION. I THINK THE MAIN THING HE FOCUSES ON ALL OF THIS IS LOVE. TO TOUCH YOUR BABY EARLY ON, TO BREASTFEED IF YOU CAN, HE SAYS, "READ FRENCH OBSTETRICIAN FREDERIC LEBOYER, WHO POPULARIZED THE PRACTICE OF IMMERSING THE NEWBORN IN A WARM WATER BATH, WITHOUT DRUGS AND WITHOUT BRIGHT LIGHTS. LEBOYER RECOMMENDS THAT THE BABY BE HELD RIGHT AWAY AND FOR A LONG TIME. HE ADVISES AGAINST CUTTING THE UMBILICAL CORD TOO SOON AS THE CHILD'S ATTACHMENT WITH HIS MOTHER IS VITAL AT THE START OF LIFE." "THERE IS NO GREATER ADVICE I CAN GIVE THAN THIS: BE OPEN, AND FEELING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. A CARING MOTHER GIVES HER BABY THE BEST CHANCE FOR LONG-TERM WELL-BEING. YES, EVEN IF YOU DON'T EAT THOSE CARROTS AND TOMATOES WHEN YOU SHOULD, LOVE WILL HELP. YOUR CHILD IS PART OF YOU AND FEELS WHAT YOU FEEL, EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS IT. ALL I ASK IS AWARENESS. THE RESEARCH IS THERE; WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS ANYMORE." HE'S PUTTING IT OUT THERE, WE HAVE RESEARCH INTO THIS FIELD, WE CAN'T TURN A BLIND EYE TO IT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN.
12	BIG BLUE IS THE LATEST COMPANY TO BET ON AN ENTERPRISE FUTURE ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN THE LATEST SIGN THAT THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND BITCOIN IS BEING EMBRACED BY THE CORPORATE WORLD, IBM SAYS ITS EXPLORING HOW THE CRYPTOCURRENCYS SHARED LEDGER SYSTEM CAN BE USED IN FIELDS FROM BANKING TO THE INTERNET OF THINGS. "ITS A COMPLETELY NOVEL ARCHITECTURE FOR BUSINESSA FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING A NEW GENERATION OF TRANSACTIONAL APPLICATIONS THAT ESTABLISH TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY WHILE STREAMLINING BUSINESS PROCESSES," WROTE ARVIND KRISHNA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR OF IBM RESEARCH, IN A BLOG POST WEDNESDAY. "IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO VASTLY REDUCE THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF GETTING THINGS DONE." THE NOTION OF A BLOCKCHAIN WAS FIRST DEVELOPED BY BITCOINS PSEUDONYMOUS INVENTOR SATOSHI NAKAMOTO TO RECORD TRANSACTIONS IN THE CURRENCY WITHOUT THE NEED FOR BANKS OR ANY CENTRAL AUTHORITY. ALL TRANSFERS OF BITCOIN ARE ANNOUNCED TO THE CURRENCYS NETWORK OF USERS, AND BITCOIN MINERS ARE REWARDED WITH NEWLY GENERATED COINS FOR BUNDLING THOSE TRANSACTIONS INTO SPECIALLY FORMATTED RECORDS CALLED BLOCKS. NEW BLOCKS NEED TO SATISFY CERTAIN MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES WHEN TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THOSE ALREADY GENERATED, AND THE COMPLETE HISTORIC TRANSACTION RECORD IS KNOWN AS THE BLOCKCHAIN. THE BLOCKCHAIN, AND SELF-UPDATING APPLIANCES RIVAL CRYPTOCURRENCIES LIKE LITECOIN AND DOGECOIN EACH HAVE THEIR OWN BLOCKCHAINS, AND VARIOUS PROJECTS HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH USING BLOCKCHAINS TO STORE DATA BESIDES FINANCIAL TRANSFER RECORDS. A PROJECT CALLED NAMECOIN USES ITS BLOCKCHAIN TO RECORD INTERNET DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATIONS, AND THE ETHEREUM PROJECT ALLOWS ITS BLOCKCHAIN TO STORE SIMPLE PROGRAMS CALLED "SMART CONTRACTS" THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFER FUNDS WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. TO IBM, WHICH HAS SEEN DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS EVOLVE FROM THE MAINFRAME-BASED SYSTEMS OF THE 1960S AND 70S TO TODAYS DISTRIBUTED SQL DATABASES, THE BLOCKCHAIN CONCEPT MIGHT JUST BE THE NEXT BIG THING IN SHARING DATA. THE COMPANY SAYS BLOCKCHAINS FUTURE BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SYSTEMS COULD MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER TO SHARE RECORDS AND EXECUTE ALL KINDS OF TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE BASED ON MORE TRADITIONAL CURRENCY. "WE ALWAYS HAVE OUR EYE OUT FOR THE NEXT INNOVATION AROUND THESE THINGS," SAYS IBM MIDDLEWARE CTO JERRY CUOMO. "WHEN YOU LOOK AT BLOCKCHAINTHAT NOTION OF A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT IS PEER-TO-PEER AND BASED ON SHARED LEDGER AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY WITH SMART CONTRACTSIT KIND OF TURNS THE MODEL ON ITS SIDE A BIT." CUOMO SAYS IBMS WORKING ON PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROJECTS WITH CLIENTS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES TO EXPLORE HOW BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY CAN MAKE THEIR BUSINESSES MORE EFFICIENT. COMPANIES COULD STORE TRANSACTIONS WITH SUPPLIERS AROUND THE GLOBE IN A SHARED BLOCKCHAIN, RATHER THAN MANUALLY EXCHANGING DATA FROM SEPARATE DATABASES, FOR EXAMPLE. CAR RENTAL AGENCIES COULD USE SMART CONTRACTS THAT AUTOMATICALLY ALLOW RENTALS WHEN PAYMENTS RECEIVED AND INSURANCE INFORMATION IS CONFIRMED THROUGH A BLOCKCHAIN RECORD, HE SAYS. "WHEN ALL OF THESE THREE AGREEMENTS ARE OUT THERE ON THE CHAIN, WE KIND OF FORM THE FINAL AGREEMENT, WHICH IS, ITS YOURS," HE SAYS. "YOU OWN THIS THING FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME, OR WHATEVER THE CONTRACT SAYS." AND SMART APPLIANCES MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE TO USE A BLOCKCHAIN INSTEAD OF A CONNECTION TO A TRADITIONAL CLOUD SERVER TO INTERACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD. "FOR INSTANCE, A REFRIGERATOR EQUIPPED WITH SENSORS AND CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET COULD USE BLOCKCHAIN TO MANAGE AUTOMATED INTERACTIONS WITH THE EXTERNAL WORLDANYTHING FROM ORDERING AND PAYING FOR FOOD TO ARRANGING FOR ITS OWN SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND TRACKING ITS WARRANTY," KRISHNA WROTE IN THE BLOG POST. BEFORE THE SYSTEMS CAN BE USED FOR POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE TRANSACTIONS, ITLL BE IMPORTANT TO GET PRIVACY AND SECURITY SETTINGS RIGHT, CUOMO SAYS, JUST AS CLOUD COMPUTING PROVIDERS HAVE ADAPTED TO STORING PROTECTED INFORMATION LIKE HEALTH RECORDS. A LOT OF THAT WILL COME DOWN TO BASIC ENCRYPTION OF THE DATA STORED ON THE CHAIN, ALONG WITH SOME TWEAKS TO EXISTING PROTOCOLS TO MAKE IT HARDER TO TRACK WHOS DOING BUSINESS WITH WHOM BASED ON THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS THAT ARE USED AS IDENTIFIERS. "YOU CAN LOOK OVER TIME AND SAY, HEY, EVERY MONDAY MORNING, PUBLIC KEY A IS DOING SOMETHING WITH PUBLIC KEY B,' AND, 'HEY, I DO SOMETHING WITH PUBLIC KEY B EVERY TUESDAY, AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DEDUCE SOMETHING FROM THAT, WHICH IN SOME CASES JUST WOULDN'T NOT BE ALLOWED," CUOMO SAYS. MEMBERS ONLY AND WHILE CURRENT PROJECTS LIKE BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM HAVE RELIED ON PUBLIC BLOCKCHAINS WHERE ALL USERS ARE ESSENTIALLY EQUAL, ENTERPRISE BLOCKCHAIN PROJECTS COULD USE INVITE-ONLY CHAINS WHERE DIFFERENT USERS HAVE DIFFERENT PRIVILEGES TO INITIATE AND VALIDATE DIFFERENT TRANSACTIONS, HE SAYS. IBMS ANNOUNCEMENT OF ITS PUSH INTO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGYWHICH CUOMO SAYS HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF RESEARCH WITHIN THE FIRM FOR AT LEAST THE PAST YEARFOLLOWS TUESDAYS NEWS THAT NINE MAJOR BANKS, INCLUDING GOLDMAN SACHS, JP MORGAN, CREDIT SUISSE, AND BARCLAYS, ARE WORKING WITH TECH FIRM R3 TO TEST AND STANDARDIZE BLOCKCHAIN TOOLS FOR THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY. OVERSTOCK.COM, THE ONLINE RETAILER THAT BEGAN ACCEPTING BITCOIN LAST YEAR, IS ALSO DEVELOPING ITS OWN BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SECURITIES TRADING PLATFORM CALLED T0. THE COMPANY MADE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SALES OF SO-CALLED CRYPTOBONDS THROUGH THE PLATFORM EARLIER THIS YEAR TO OVERSTOCK CEO PATRICK BYRNE AND TO FINANCIAL FIRM FIRST NEW YORK, AND SAYS T0 WILL SETTLE TRANSACTIONS SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN TRADITIONAL EXCHANGES. CUOMO SAYS IBM PLANS TO RELEASE SOURCE CODE AND OTHER DATA FROM ITS BLOCKCHAIN RESEARCH WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHSPOSSIBLY INCLUDING AN INTERNAL FLOWCHART HE SAYS THE COMPANY USES TO ILLUSTRATE WHEN USING A BLOCKCHAIN MAKES SENSE AND WHEN IT DOESN'T. "A BLOCKCHAIN IS THE NEW SHINY OBJECT, BUT IN SOME CASES, IF ITS USED FOR THE WRONG THING, IT MIGHT BE TWICE AS SLOW AND TWICE AS EXPENSIVE AS USING A TRADITIONAL DATABASE," HE SAYS.
13	FRANKLIN. THE 1927 ROUTE BEGAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND ENDED AT BALBOA PARK, IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, 116 DAYS LATER. EVERYONE FROM MILITARY AFICIONADOS TO KIDS WHO DIG COOL TRUCKS LINED THE STREETS OF HISTORIC DOWNTOWN VILLA RICA THURSDAY EVENING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE MILITARY VEHICLE PRESERVATION ASSOCIATION 2015 BANKHEAD HIGHWAY CROSS-COUNTRY CONVOY.THE CONVOY, CONSISTING OF ABOUT 65 ILITARY VEHICLES AND MOVING AT TOP SPEEDS OF 35 MILES PER HOUR, IS TRAVELING FROM WASHINGTON TO SAN DIEGO AND STOPPED IN VILLA RICA ON THURSDAY NIGHT AT THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF VILLA RICA, WHERE THEY WERE GREETED BY APPROXIMATELY 9,500 PEOPLE. MILITARY VEHICLE FANS WERE INVITED TO THE CHURCH TO GET AN UP-CLOSE-AND-PERSONAL LOOK AT THE REFURBISHED AND UNIQUE VEHICLES.VILLA RICA MAYOR J. COLLINS ADDRESSED THE CROWD, SAYING HIS  CITY WAS PROUD TO HOST THE GROUP. DOESNT IT SAY A LOT ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE CAN GATHER HERE AT THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF VILLA RICA AND CELEBRATE OUR COUTRY, HE SAID. ITS A NIGHT THAT WERE THANKFUL TO BE VILLA RICANS, WERE THANKFUL TO BE AMERICANS AND WERE THANKFUL FOR THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH AND THEIR GRACIOUS HOSPITALITY HERE.THE CHURCHS PASTOR, KEVIN WILLIAMS, WHO IS ALSO A VETERAN OF THE MILITARY POLICE, SAID HE WAS AMAZED AT THE SIZE OF THE CROWD. IM PROUD WE COULD HAVE THEM HERE, HE SAID. WILLIAMS AND VOLUNTEERS AT THE CHURCH HANDED OUT BIBLES WITH A LETTER INSIDE, DATED JAN.  AS A RESULT, WE VIEW THE RECENT WEAKNESS AS MORE TECHNICAL IN NATURE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT U.S. 25, 1941, FROM PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT.I TAKE GREAT PLEASURE IN COMMENDING THE READING OF THE BIBLE TO ALL WHO SERVE IN THE ARMED FORCES, THE LETTER READS.THE TRIP THROUGH VILLA RICA RETRACED THE APPROXIMATE ROUTE TAKEN BY THE U.S.  ON THURSDAY AND HAD A POLICE ESCORT FROM THE DOUGLAS COUNTY LINE ON BANKHEAD HIGHWAY.IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIN, STATE SEN. MIKE DUGAN, R-CARROLLTON, SAID. THERE WERE MILITARY VEHICLES FROM MULTIPLE ERAS. I WAS AS EXCITED AS EVERYONE IN THE CROWD. I WAS ALSO VERY PROUD THAT THEY SAID OURS WAS TH LARGEST RECEPTION THEYVE RECEIVED YET. THE GROUP WAS EXPECTED THIS MORNING TO START BACK AGAIN ON ITS 3,300 MILE JOURNEY ONE THAT WILL TAKE 29 DAYS TO COMPLETE.IN 1920, THE ARMY DECIDED TO PLAN AND EXECUTE A MOTOR CONVOY OF VARIOUS MILITARY VEHICLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON THE NEWLY FORMED BANKHEAD HIGHWA. THIS CONVOY WAS A FOLLOW-ON PROJECT TO THE 1919 U.S.  ALONG THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY. THE ARMY WAS DETERMINED TO FURTHER ITS UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRACTICALITY OF A MOTORIZED TRANSPORT AND ITS PLACE IN THE ARMY. THAT CONVOY WAS COMMANDED BY COL. JOHN F.
14	PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU DEPARTED MONDAY MORNING ON A LIGHTNING VISIT TO MOSCOW, WHERE HE WAS SCHEDULED TO HOLD A THREE-HOUR MEETING WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN BEFORE RETURNING TO ISRAEL IN THE EVENING. THE FOCUS OF THE MEETING WAS EXPECTED TO BE RUSSIA'S DEPLOYMENT OF MILITARY FORCES IN SYRIA. LAST WEEK, AN ISRAELI OFFICIAL SAID NETANYAHU WOULD PRESENT TO PUTIN "THE THREATS TO ISRAEL EMANATING FROM THE INCREASED FLOW OF ADVANCED WEAPONRY TO THE SYRIAN ARENA AND FROM THE TRANSFER OF LETHAL WEAPONRY TO HEZBOLLAH AND OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS." NETANYAHU WAS EXPECTED TO TELL PUTIN THAT ISRAEL WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY LIMITS ON ITS FREEDOM TO OPERATE IN SYRIA. IN RECENT YEARS, FOREIGN MEDIA OUTLETS HAVE REPORTED A NUMBER OF ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES IN SYRIA THAT WERE MEAN TO PREVENT THE TRANSFER OF WEAPONRY FROM THE ASSAD REGIME TO HEZBOLLAH AND OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS. ISRAEL WANTS TO AVOID ANY FRICTION WITH RUSSIAN FORCES ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA. IF RUSSIAN SOLDIERS WERE ACCIDENTALLY HIT IN ANY ISRAELI STRIKES IN SYRIA, THIS COULD CAUSE A CRISIS IN THE ISRAEL-RUSSIA RELATIONSHIP. ON THE ISSUE OF RUSSIA'S MILITARY PRESENCE IN SYRIA, THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT IS IN COORDINATION WITH THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. THE U.S. IS ALSO ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA ABOUT ITS MILITARY PRESENCE IN SYRIA. OTHER OFFICIALS TAKING PART IN THE NETANYAHU-PUTIN MEETING WILL BE IDF CHIEF OF STAFF LT. GEN. GADI EIZENKOT AND MAJ. GEN. HERZL HALEVI, HEAD OF THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE. THE PARTICIPATION OF MILITARY OFFICIALS IN A DIPLOMATIC MEETING BETWEEN TWO HEADS OF STATE IS UNUSUAL. THEIR PRESENCE EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE ISRAEL PLACES ON AVOIDING A CONFRONTATION WITH RUSSIAN MILITARY FORCES IN SYRIA. NETANYAHU'S ENTOURAGE TO MOSCOW ALSO INCLUDES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER YOSSI COHEN, MILITARY SECRETARY BRIG. GEN. ELIEZER TOLEDANO AND THE PRIME MINISTER'S MEDIA ADVISER, BOAZ STEMBLER. UNLIKE ON MOST OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S TRIPS ABROAD, NO JOURNALISTS ARE ACCOMPANYING HIM DURING THE MOSCOW VISIT. MEANWHILE, NEW SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW FOUR RUSSIAN SUKHOI FIGHTER PLANES PARKED AT AN AIRPORT NEAR THE SYRIAN COASTAL CITY OF LATAKIA. THE PLANES, IDENTIFIED IN DIFFERENT REPORTS AS EITHER SU-27S OR SU-30S, FLEW TO SYRIA VIA IRANIAN AND IRAQI AIRSPACE.

16	LAST POST IN THIS THREAD I MENTIONED THAT I HAD OBTAINED SOME 'HONDURAN' MAHOGANY FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD ON THE CABINET. I WASN'T ENTIRELY PLEASED WITH THE MATERIAL I RECEIVED AS I HAD WANTED QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY, WHILE 7 OUT OF THE 10 BOARDS RECEIVED WERE NOT FITTING THAT DESCRIPTION AT ALL. I REALIZE NOW THAT QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY IS NOT GENERALLY WHAT WAS BEING CUT - LOGS ARE INVARIABLY SAWN THROUGH AND THROUGH - AND THUS QS STOCK IS LESS COMMONLY AVAILABLE THAN I HAD THOUGHT. SO, TRYING TO OBTAIN MORE (IN BULK) IN THE HOPE OF SCORING SOME MORE QUARTERSAWN BOARDS WAS NOT LOOKING PROMISING. NONE OF THE RETAILERS I SPOKE WITH SEEMED EVEN WILLING TO DO A SORT FOR A FEW BOARDS, AND FAIR ENOUGH. AFTER FURTHER RUMINATION, I DECIDED IT WOULD BE BEST TO CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SPECIES FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD, A SPECIES THAT WAS TYPICALLY CUT FOR QUARTERSAWN FROM THE GET-GO AND WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD MATCH FOR THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE REST OF THE CABINET. I'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED WOODS SUCH AS MAHOGANY, BLACK CHERRY, AND SWISS PEAR WOOD FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD. NONE OF THOSE WERE LIKELY TO FIT THE REQUIREMENTS I HAD IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION, SO I KEPT LOOKING. I FINALLY CAME ACROSS A SUITABLE MATERIAL, AND IT IS BOTANICALLY RELATED TO BUBINGA (WHICH IS GUIBORTIA TESSMANII OR GUIBORTIA PELLAGRINIANA OR GUIBORTIA DEMEUSEI). THIS IS A WOOD CALLED SHEDUA, AKA OVANGKOL, WHICH COMES FROM THE SPECIES GUIBORTIA EHIE. THIS IS A SOMEWHAT SMALLER TREE THAN THOSE SPECIES FROM WHICH BUBINGA IS OBTAINED, HOWEVER IN MANY RESPECTS SHEDUA SHARES THE SAME WORKING QUALITIES AS BUBINGA. THE WOOD COMES FROM WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES LIKE GABON AND CAMEROON, AND THE TREE IS MORE COMMONLY UTILIZED FOR ITS GUM RESIN, CALLED CONGO COPAL, THAN ITS TIMBER. THE TIMBER IS NOT VERY COMMONLY AVAILABLE, AND DOES SEEM TO FIND A CERTAIN FAVOR AMONG THE GUITAR-MAKING COMMUNITY. HERE'S A GUITAR WITH A SHEDUA BACK: (FROM:HTTP://WWW.GUITARBENCH.COM/2012/01/04/SHEDUA-TONEWOOD-PROFILE/) AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS A MORE BROWNISH CAST THAN BUBINGA, BUT SHARES THE BLACK STREAKS. COMPARING SHEDUA'S MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WITH BUBINGA, IT IS VERY CLOSE INDEED, BEING VERY SLIGHTLY LIGHTER AND DENSER, A LITTLE LOWER IN VOLUMETRIC CHANGE DUE TO MOISTURE CONTENT CHANGE, A SLIGHT BIT SOFTER IN TERMS OF CRUSHING STRENGTH AND A HAIR STIFFER IN BENDING STRENGTH (MODULUS OF ELASTICITY). I IMAGINE, THEREFORE, THAT IT SHOULD HAVE FAIRLY SIMILAR WORKING QUALITIES TO BUBINGA. THIS IMAGE FROM HEARNE HARDWOODS SHOWS THE VARIED APPEARANCE OF SHEDUA BASED ON THE GRAIN ORIENTATION: AS IT SO HAPPENS, HEARNE WAS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THE US WHICH HAD ANY STOCK OF SHEDUA AT ALL, LET ALONE QS AND/OR FIGURED STOCK. IN FACT, THEY HAD A DECENTLY SIZED STACK OF 12/4 MATERIAL, 6~12" WIDE, 16' LONG OR LONGER, AND SOME OF IT WAS QUARTERSAWN. CONSIDERING FEW OTHER RETAILERS HAVE ANY OF THIS MATERIAL, IT WAS AMAZING TO COME ACROSS SUCH NICE STOCK. THEY ALSO TOOK TIME TO REPLY TO MY EMAILS, AND SEND PICTURES, ONCE I HAD DEMONSTRATED SOLID INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL - - AND HAD GIVEN THEM MY CREDIT CARD INFO! THEY SEEM TO BE A WOOD RETAILER SPECIALIZING IN HIGH QUALITY AND RARE MATERIALS. THEY SENT ME SOME PICTURES OF A COUPLE OF BOARDS WHICH MATCHED THE REQUIREMENTS I GAVE THEM, SWABBED WITH ALCOHOL TO MAKE THE FIGURE A BIT CLEARER THOUGH NOT SHOWING THE TONE WHICH WILL BE OBTAINED WITH A PROPER FINISH: THEY WERE WONDERING IF I WAS SO DETERMINED TO HAVE QUARTERSAWN BECAUSE I WAS A LUTHIER, HOWEVER I LET THEM KNOW THEY WERE GUESSING WRONG. I DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC REASONS FOR WANTING QUARTERSAWN MATERIAL OF COURSE. THE GUY WHO SENT ME THE PICTURES STATED THAT THESE TWO BOARDS MIGHT BE THE NICEST IN THE ENTIRE PILE. I ASKED FOR A FOLLOW-UP PIC OF THE END GRAIN OF THE TWO BOARDS, TO CONFIRM THEY WERE WHAT I WANTED IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION: AND THE OTHER BOARD, ABOUT 12" WIDE: THE STICKS ARE HARD TO SCALE UNTIL YOU NOTICE THAT A FORKLIFT IS DOING THE LIFTING.... THE STOCK LOOKED GOOD TO ME. THE PRICE WAS STEEP, AT $35/BOARD FOOT, SO EACH OF THOSE BOARDS WAS $1400.00, HOWEVER I WAS ABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE COST SOMEWHAT BY SELLING A PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY-ACQUIRED MAHOGANY OFF TO ANOTHER WOODWORKER IN MY BUILDING. I ORDERED THOSE TWO BOARDS AND THEY SHOULD BE AT MY SHOP IN ANOTHER 3~4 DAYS. I THINK THIS WOOD WILL GO VERY NICELY WITH THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE BULK OF THE CABINET: I THINK THE CAD REPRESENTATION OF THE SHEDUA IS APPROXIMATE AT BEST. IN RECENT DAYS I HAVE REVISED THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DIVIDERS ON THE LOWER BANK OF DRAWERS, MAKING THEM STRAIGHT INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM MATCH THE DRAWER CURVES, AND RECESSING THEM BACK SLIGHTLY - THIS FOR AMONG OTHER REASONS, TO INCREASE THE SHADOW LINE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE CURVED DRAWERS AND THE SURROUNDING FRAMEWORK: THE DIVIDER'S OUTER ARRISES WILL ADDITIONALLY BE CHAMFERED. THE DRAWERS THEMSELVES WILL HAVE A BEADED PERIMETER DETAIL, AND HAVE THE DRAWER SIDEWALL THROUGH- TENONS POKING OUT, NEITHER OF WHICH IS NOT ILLUSTRATED YET, AND THE HANDLE DESIGN FOR THE DRAWERS REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION. LIKEWISE, THE UPPER SET OF DRAWERS AND DOORS REMAINS JUST A FRONTAL PLANE AT THE MOMENT WITH NO ALLOWANCE FOR SET BACK, CHAMFERING, ETC.. GETTING THERE! THANKS FOR VISITING THE CARPENTRY WAY. GOT SOME MACHINE'S COMING SOON SO I AM WORKING ON GETTING MY SHOP READY FOR THAT - THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE SUBJECT OF THE NEXT POST.
17	DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, LATELY IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS (LETS CALL THEM RAOUL AND CHRISTINE, FOR CONVENIENCES SAKE) THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND RECENTLY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP. IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT CLOSE TO TEN YEARS AND I CONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP. RAOUL, IVE KNOWN FOR ALMOST AS LONG, BUT WE LIVE IN THE SAME CITY AND HANG OUT OCCASIONALLY. THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES. CHRISTINE AND I HAD A FALLING OUT SOME TIME AGO AND ONLY RECENTLY RECONNECTED. DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST. ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN THOUGH RAOUL IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, I HAVE GOTTEN TO SEE A LOT OF HIS BAD SIDE (PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, SINCE I DONT TRUST MYSELF TO NOT BE BIASED), INCLUDING HIS (SEEMING) UNWILLINGNESS TO BE AFFECTIONATE EVEN IN A RELATIONSHIP HE INITIATES. IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL IN ONE OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER, THIS WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND RAOUL HAS SINCE CHANGED. ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?). I KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME; I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THAT. BUT I JUST CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. PART OF ME WONDERS IF IM BEING TOO CLINGY ABOUT THIS? ITS THEIR LIVES AND I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO GET IT IN PRACTICE. ANOTHER PART WONDERS IF IM BEING UNFAIR TO RAOUL? MAYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR THEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE. IVE THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW IM NOT AS BOTHERED AS I WAS INITIALLY. UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH. I STILL CANT FULLY COME TO TERMS WITH IT AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS BETTER THAN THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY I CANT JUST LIVE AND LET LIVE? WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO? SIGNED, OVERLY ANXIOUS FOR NO GOOD REASON

21	CONVICTED SERIAL PEDOPHILE DENNIS MCKENNA ABUSED A STUDENT TWICE BUT THE BOY LATER TRAVELLED WITH HIM BECAUSE THE OFFENDING HAD STOPPED AND HE WANTED TO GO OVERSEAS, A PERTH COURT HAS HEARD. MCKENNA IS ON TRIAL IN THE WEST AUSTRALIAN DISTRICT COURT CHARGED WITH TWO COUNTS OF INDECENTLY ASSAULTING THE TEENAGER WHEN HE WAS THE WARDEN AT ST ANDREWS HOSTEL IN KATANNING IN 1981 AND 1982. THE COMPLAINANT TESTIFIED ON MONDAY THAT HE WAS INVITED TO MCKENNA'S FLAT SEVERAL TIMES WITH OTHER STUDENTS WHERE THEY WATCHED PORNOGRAPHIC FILMS AND DRANK ALCOHOL. ONE NIGHT, MCKENNA ALLEGEDLY SAT IN THE COMPLAINANT'S BED WHILE CHATTING WITH STUDENTS AND PLACED THE BOY'S HAND OVER HIS UNDERWEAR. THE COMPLAINANT SAID HE WAS "FROZEN WITH DISBELIEF" WHILE HIS HAND WAS ON MCKENNA'S ERECTION FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, UNTIL MCKENNA WHISPERED FOR HIM TO REMOVE HIS HAND AND SAID TO THE GROUP: "OK BOYS, THAT'S ENOUGH TONIGHT." ANOTHER TIME, MCKENNA ALLEGEDLY TOLD THE BOY TO VISIT HIS FLAT AFTER LIGHTS OUT AND THE TEENAGER DID SO BELIEVING IT WAS ANOTHER GROUP MOVIE NIGHT. NO ONE ELSE WAS THERE AND THE COMPLAINANT ENDED UP LYING NAKED IN BED WITH MCKENNA, WHO CARESSED AND MASTURBATED HIM FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. "PART OF ME WAS HORRIFIED, PART OF ME WAS CONFUSED AND SCARED, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS OCCURRING, HOW AND WHY MY BODY WAS REACTING THE WAY IT WAS," HE SAID. AFTER GRADUATING, THE COMPLAINANT SAID HE WORKED AT THE HOSTEL FOR A FEW MONTHS AND WENT ON AN OVERSEAS HOLIDAY WITH MCKENNA, SLEEPING IN A TWIN-SHARE ROOM WITH HIM, BUT THERE WAS NO SEXUAL OFFENDING. THE COMPLAINANT INITIALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GROUP TRIP, BUT OTHERS PULLED OUT. HE SAID MCKENNA HAD STOPPED ABUSING HIM AND AS A CHILD "FROM NOWHERE" HE DID NOT WANT TO MISS A CHANCE TO GO ON AN OVERSEAS HOLIDAY. THE COMPLAINANT SAID HE DECIDED TO COME FORWARD WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE BLAXELL INQUIRY, WHICH INVESTIGATED ABUSE AT THE HOSTEL, BUT COULD NOT GET THROUGH OVER THE PHONE. "CONFRONTING THIS AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WAS VERY PAINFUL," HE SAID. THE COMPLAINANT HELD BACK TEARS AS HE EXPLAINED HE GAVE A STATEMENT TO POLICE FOR HIS CHILDREN. "I WANTED FOR THEM TO KNOW THEY CAN ALWAYS FIND IT WITHIN THEMSELVES TO STAND UP," HE SAID. JUDGE JULIE WAGER, WHO IS TRYING THE CASE WITHOUT A JURY, WILL HEAR DETAILS ABOUT MCKENNA'S PRIOR CONVICTIONS FOR ABUSING OTHER BOYS AT THE HOSTEL. PROSECUTOR BERNARD STANDISH SAID IT WOULD DEMONSTRATE MCKENNA HAD A PROPENSITY TO BE ATTRACTED TO ADOLESCENT MALES AND A TENDENCY TO ACT ON THAT ATTRACTION. DEFENCE LAWYER SIMON WATTERS SAID THE COMPLAINT ONLY CAME FORWARD AFTER IT WAS REVEALED THERE WOULD BE REDRESS PAYMENTS OF UP TO $45,000. THE TRIAL CONTINUES.
22	(NANOWERK NEWS) RESEARCHERS AT CIC NANOGUNE (BASQUE COUNTRY) IN COLLABORATION WITH COLLEAGUES AT ICFO - THE INSTITUTE OF PHOTONIC SCIENCES (CATALUNYA) HAVE IMAGED HOW LIGHT MOVES INSIDE AN EXOTIC CLASS OF MATTER KNOWN AS HYPERBOLIC MATERIALS. THEY OBSERVED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, ULTRASLOW PULSE PROPAGATION AND BACKWARD PROPAGATING WAVES IN DEEP SUBWAVELENGTH-SCALE THICK SLABS OF BORON NITRIDE A NATURAL HYPERBOLIC MATERIAL FOR INFRARED LIGHT. THIS WORK HAS BEEN FUNDED BY THE EC GRAPHENE FLAGSHIP AND WAS RECENTLY REPORTED IN NATURE PHOTONICS (). HYPERBOLIC MATERIALS ARE VERY SPECIAL BECAUSE THEY BEHAVE LIKE A METAL IN ONE DIRECTION, BUT LIKE AN INSULATOR IN THE OTHER. UNTIL NOW, THESE MATERIALS HAVE BEEN USED TO FABRICATE COMPLEX NANOSTRUCTURES THAT PERMIT SUBWAVELENGTH-SCALE IMAGING, AS WELL AS THE FOCUSING AND CONTROLLING OF LIGHT AT THE NANOSCALE. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO FULLY EXPLOIT THEIR POTENTIAL, IT IS NECESSARY TO STUDY AND UNDERSTAND HOW LIGHT BEHAVES INSIDE THEM. THE WORK LAYS THE FOUNDATIONS FOR STUDYING THE PRECISE MANNER IN WHICH LIGHT TRAVELS THROUGH COMPLEX OPTICAL SYSTEMS AT THE SUBWAVELENGTH SCALE IN EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS OF DETAIL. SUCH A CAPABILITY WILL BE VITAL FOR VERIFYING THAT FUTURE NANOPHOTONIC DEVICES, PERHAPS WITH BIOSENSING OR OPTICAL COMPUTING APPLICATIONS, ARE FUNCTIONING AS EXPECTED. "THE DIFFICULTY IN PERFORMING THE REPORTED EXPERIMENTS IS THE EXTREMELY SHORT WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT WHEN IT IS INSIDE A HYPERBOLIC MATERIAL EXPLAINS IKERBASQUE PROFESSOR RAINER HILLENBRAND, LEADER OF THE NANOOPTICS GROUP AT NANOGUNE. WHEN LIGHT MOVES INSIDE THE MATERIAL IN OUR CASE MID-INFRARED LIGHT IN A 135 NM BORON NITRIDE SLAB - IT TRAVELS IN THE FORM OF WHAT WE CALL A POLARITON, WHERE THE LIGHT IS ACTUALLY COUPLED TO THE VIBRATIONS OF THE MATTER ITSELF". THESE POLARITONS CAN BE CONSIDERED A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD TO THE SCIENTISTS TRYING TO STUDY THEM. ON THE ONE HAND, THEY SQUEEZE LIGHT INTO MUCH SMALLER VOLUMES THAN IS NORMALLY POSSIBLE. THIS IS HELPFUL FOR A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE THE MANIPULATION OF LIGHT IN TINY SPACES, SUCH AS DETECTING AND IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUAL MOLECULES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS ULTRA-HIGH CONFINEMENT MEANS THAT SPECIAL TECHNIQUES HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED TO LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOR. EDWARD YOXALL, WHO PERFORMED THE EXPERIMENTS AT NANOGUNE ALONG WITH MARTIN SCHNELL, ELABORATES: "BECAUSE THE WAVELENGTH OF A POLARITON IS SO SMALL, WE CANNOT USE 'CONVENTIONAL' OPTICAL EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS LENSES AND CAMERAS, TO IMAGE IT. INSTEAD, WE HAVE TO USE A SPECIAL TYPE OF MICROSCOPE." THIS MICROSCOPE - A SCATTERING-TYPE SCANNING NEAR-FIELD INFRARED MICROSCOPE - IS CAPABLE OF SEEING DETAILS 1000 TIMES SMALLER THAN A STANDARD INFRARED MICROSCOPE, VISUALIZING "OBJECTS" OF JUST 10 NANOMETERS. "BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION THAT MAKES TRACKING POLARITONS TRICKY", CONTINUES YOXALL. "IF WE WANT TO SEE HOW A POLARITON MOVES, WE NEED TO DETECT AND TRACK IT IN BOTH SPACE AND TIME. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY USING EXTREMELY SHORT FLASHES OF LIGHT - OR PULSES- THAT ARE JUST 100 FEMTOSECONDS LONG." THAT IS AN EXTREMELY SMALL NUMBER; LESS THAN ONE MILLIONTH OF A MILLIONTH OF A SECOND. BY USING THESE VERY SHORT FLASHES IN COMBINATION WITH THEIR NEAR-FIELD MICROSCOPE, THE RESEARCHERS ARE ABLE TO WATCH THE POLARITONS PASSING DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ALONG THE BORON NITRIDE SLAB, ALLOWING FOR MEASURING THEIR SPEED. BY USING BOTH THE SPACE AND TIME INFORMATION THAT IS GATHERED DURING THE EXPERIMENT, THE SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXACTLY DETERMINE HOW THE POLARITON WAS TRAVELLING. THE TIME- AND SPACE-RESOLVED MAPS REVEALED A RANGE OF INTRIGUING BEHAVIORS OF THE POLARITONS, INCLUDING A DRAMATIC SLOWING DOWN OF THE PULSE VELOCITY - BELOW 1 PERCENT OF THE LIGHT VELOCITY IN VACUUM- AND A REVERSAL OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE POLARITON WAVES WERE PROPAGATING IN RELATION TO THE DIRECTION OF THE ENERGY FLOW. AN EXCITING RESULT IS THE SPEED AT WHICH THE POLARITON MOVES, SAYS YOXALL. THERES A LOT OF INTEREST IN SLOW LIGHT, AND WHAT WEVE SHOWN HERE IS A NOVEL WAY OF ACHIEVING THIS. SLOW LIGHT IN CONVENTIONAL PHOTONIC STRUCTURES HAS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR MANIFOLD APPLICATIONS IN SENSING AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, OWING TO ENHANCE LIGHT-MATTER INTERACTIONS. THE DEEP SUBWAVELENGTH-SCALE CONFINEMENT OF SLOW POLARITONS IN HYPERBOLIC MATERIALS COULD HELP TO MINIATURIZE THESE DEVICES.
23	ARCHIVE: ONTARIO DOCTORS WARN THAT PATIENTS WILL HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CUTTING THEIR FEES.  DR. MICHAEL TOTH, PRESIDENT OF THE ONTARIO MEDICAL ASSOCIATION , SAYS THE PROFESSION IS FRUSTRATED AND SOME MEMBERS ARE TALKING ABOUT LEAVING THE PROVINCE OR RETIRING EARLY. "IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PATIENTS ULTIMATELY," HE WARNED, NOTING THAT SOME PHYSICIANS WILL BE FORCED TO LAY OFF STAFF AND CUT OFFICE BUDGETS.  NEARLY 80 PERCENT OR PARTICIPANTS IN THE STUDY REPORTED THAT THEIR WORK HAD BEEN HALTED BY THE REGIMES REPRESSION, AND HALF OF ALL PARTICIPANTS SAID THAT THREATS HAD NOT BEEN LIMITED TO THEM BUT HAD INCLUDED THEIR FAMILIES.  MR CAMERON ALSO REPORTEDLY JOKINGLY REFERRED TO HAVING HAD TO VISIT HIS DOCTOR  FOR AN INJURY TO HIS BACK, SAYING THAT WHEN THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM THE INJECTION HE WAS GETTING WOULD BE JUST A LITTLE PRICK, JUST A STAB IN THE BACK, HE REPLIED THAT RATHER SUMMED UP MY DAY. PHYSICIANS ARE VENTING THEIR ANGER ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ON TWITTER , HARDLINERS ARE THREATENING JOB ACTION SUCH AS A WORK-TO-RULE CAMPAIGN, HOUR CUTBACKS AND CANCELLATION OF FLU-SHOT CLINICS. TOTH SAID THE OMA, WHICH REPRESENTS 28,000 MEMBERS, WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH GOVERNMENT AND IS CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION. HEALTH MINISTER ERIC HOSKINS SAID HE WANTS TO REASSURE ONTARIANS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERVICE CUTS.  THIS YEAR, THE GAME IS IN EAST LANSING AND MICHIGAN STATE LOOKS TO BE THE BETTER, MORE EXPERIENCED TEAM BEHIND QUARTERBACK CONNOR COOK. "MY CONCERN IS THAT A PERCEPTION IS BEING PROPAGATED THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE CHALLENGING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE FACTS SIMPLY DON'T BEAR THIS OUT," HE SAID.  THE WORLDS HIGHEST PIXEL COUNT FOR ITS SIZE . ONTARIO DOCTORS ARE AMONG THE BEST PAID IN CANADA WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF ABOUT $350,000, AN AMOUNT THAT HAS GROWN BY 60 PER CENT OVER THAT LAST DECADE, HOSKINS SAID. FROM THAT, PHYSICIANS PAY OVERHEAD COSTS, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE WAGES AND OFFICE RENT, AN AMOUNT WIDELY QUOTED AS ABOUT 30 PER CENT.  IN OTHER WORDS, A MAN WITH A SWAGGERING EGO.  DIFFERING TO YAKITORI, JAPANESE GRILLED MEAT ON SKEWERS, SUMIBIYAKI LITERALLY MEANS CHARCOAL GRILL IN JAPANESE.  FROSTY TREATS MOBILE UNIT NO. HOSKINS SAID PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED OVER WHAT IS A DISPUTE OVER REMUNERATION: "I HAVE RECEIVED ASSURANCE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE OMA THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE ACTION THAT WILL IMPACT THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY PROVIDE OR PATIENT SAFETY. I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD." THE RIFT DATES BACK TO A PAYMENT SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT UNILATERALLY IMPOSED LAST JANUARY AFTER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OMA ENDED IN AN IMPASSE.  LOCKHART OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL SPEAK AT 12:00 ON THE ECONOMY IN ATLANTA. IT INCLUDED A 2.65 PER CENT FEE CUT AND A CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IF DOCTORS' OHIP BILLINGS WERE TAKING DOCTORS OVER THEIR $11.6-ALLOTMENT. THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENT MODEL ALLOWS DOCTORS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPENSATION. IF THEY SEE MORE PATIENTS AND PERFORM MORE PROCEDURES, THEY CAN BILL THE PUBLIC INSURANCE PLAN FOR MORE MONEY. THE PAYMENT SCHEME ALSO INCLUDES INCREASES OF 1.25 PER CENT IN THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES BUDGET FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE ANNUAL INCREASES ARE INTENDED TO MEET A RISE IN DEMAND FROM A GROWING AND AGING POPULATION AND THE ADDITION OF 700 NEW DOCTORS. BUT THE OMA CONTENDS INCREASES OF 2.7 PER CENT ARE NEEDED IN EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND GROWTH. THE OMA IS LOBBYING MPPS, HOLDING TOWN HALL MEETINGS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE PROVINCE AND STAGING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH MEMBERS NEXT WEEK. TOTH ARGUED THERE IS A "POWER IMBALANCE" WITH GOVERNMENT AND CALLED FOR A NEUTRAL THIRD-PARTY TO WEIGH IN WITH A BINDING DECISION: "WE ARE LOOKING TO RESOLVE THIS ... WE THINK THE WAY TO DO THIS IS MEDIATION-ARBITRATION."
24	18, SEPTEMBER 2015: THE ACCESS TO SOLAR POWER IS FREE EXCEPT THE PRELIMINARY FEE OF INSTALLING THE SOLAR PANEL. THAT IS TO SAY THAT SOLAR POWER IS MORE MONEY-SAVING THAN ELECTRICITY POWER. THE ADVANTAGE OF CUTTING DOWN ON THE COST FOR CUSTOMERS HAS TO BE A SELLING POINT. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT SOLAR POWER WILL REPLACE THE ELECTRICITY POWER IN FOSJOAS ELECTRIC SELF-BALANCING SCOOTER. FOSJOAS ELECTRIC INTELLIGENT SCOOTER ADOPTS THE ELECTRICITY AS ITS POWER. ELECTRICITY POWER IS MODERN ONE, WHICH PRODUCE NO EMISSION AND IS GENERATED IN AN ECO-FRIENDLY WAY. MOBEN GLOBAL INC. WISELY CHOSE THE ELECTRICITY POWER AS ITS ENERGY. THE ADOPTION OF THE ELECTRICITY POWER IN FOSJOAS ELECTRIC INTELLIGENT SCOOTER CONTRIBUTES TO ITS ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER PERSONAL VEHICLES. DOES THE ELECTRICITY POWER LAST IN FOSJOAS ELECTRIC SELF-BALANCING SCOOTER FOR YEARS TO COME? THERE IS NO WAY FOR EXACTLY KNOWING IT, BUT A GUESSWORK IS POSSIBLE. MOBEN GLOBAL INC. IS AN EVER-DEVELOPING SCOOTER-MAKER. ITS CORE BRAND FOSJOAS IS ALSO MAKING PROGRESSES. IT IS REASONABLE TO TAKE IT THAT FOSJOAS ELECTRIC SELF-BALANCING SCOOTER WILL BY NO MEANS KEEP AS IT IS ALL THE TIME. ONCE A NEW TECHNOLOGY APPEARS AND GOES FOR FOSJOAS ELECTRIC SELF-BALANCING SCOOTER, MOBEN GLOBAL INC. WILL APPLY IT TO FOSJOAS ELECTRIC SELF-BALANCING SCOOTER WITHOUT DELAY. THERE IS A LONG WAY FOR FOSJOAS SCOOTER TO GO. THEREFORE, FOSJOAS ELECTRIC SELF-BALANCING SCOOTER WILL NATURALLY EXPERIENCE MANY CHANGES, ONE OF WHICH MUST BE ABOUT THE POWER. SOLAR POWER IS REGARDED AS THE NEW BRAND ONE. ALTHOUGH IT IS NO LONGER IN ITS INFANCY, THERE IS STILL A LONG TIME AWAY FROM THE LARGE-SCALE APPLICATION. THE TECHNOLOGY OF TRAPPING SOLAR POWER IS NOTICEABLE DEVELOPING. THE RECENT STUDY AND PROGRESS SHOW A PROMISING SIGN THAT THE SOLAR POWER WILL BE APPLIED ON A LARGE SCALE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. SOLAR POWER IS AS CLEAN AS ELECTRICITY POWER. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE ACCESS TO SOLAR POWER IS FREE EXCEPT THE PRELIMINARY FEE OF INSTALLING THE SOLAR PANEL. THAT IS TO SAY THAT SOLAR POWER IS MORE MONEY-SAVING THAN ELECTRICITY POWER. THE ADVANTAGE OF CUTTING DOWN ON THE COST FOR CUSTOMERS HAS TO BE A SELLING POINT. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT SOLAR POWER WILL REPLACE THE ELECTRICITY POWER IN FOSJOAS ELECTRIC SELF-BALANCING SCOOTER.

HEALTHCARE SPEND IS INCREASING WITH THE INCREASING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) EXPENDITURE. DUE TO THE INCREASING COST OF HEALTHCARE, PEOPLE ARE TURNING TOWARDS SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS, FOR A HEALTHY LIFE. ACCORDING TO THE EUROPEAN FEDERATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES AND ASSOCIATIONS (EFPIA) MEMBER ASSOCIATIONS, THE EUROPEAN PHARMACEUTICAL R&D EXPENDITURE INCREASED FROM $37,030 MILLION IN 2011 TO $38,055 MILLION IN 2012. IN THE U.S., THE EXPENDITURE INCREASED FROM $36,374 MILLION IN 2011 TO $36,810 MILLION IN 2012. ASIA-PACIFIC HOLDS A MAJOR MARKET SHARE IN THE GLOBAL VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS MARKET, FOLLOWED BY NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. ASIA-PACIFIC IS EXPECTED TO DOMINATE THE MARKET IN THE FORECAST PERIOD OWING TO INCREASING GERIATRIC POPULATION. WITH INCREASING EDUCATIONAL LEVEL COUPLED WITH INCREASING VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS PRODUCT VISIBILITY, THE CONSUMER AWARENESS REGARDING VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS IS INCREASING. ADDITIONALLY, VARIOUS SOURCES OF INFORMATION SHOWING THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS IS HELPING CONSUMERS IN DECISION MAKING FOR CHOOSING APPROPRIATE FORM OF VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS. ALSO, KNOWLEDGE OF DISEASES CAUSED DUE TO VITAMIN DEFICIENCY IS PROPELLING THE CONSUMER TO SHIFT TO VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS IN THEIR BUSY LIFESTYLE. DEFICIENCY OF VITAMIN IN BODY AT OLDER AGE INCREASES THE RISK OF DISEASES, SUCH AS NIGHT BLINDNESS, DIMINISHING EYESIGHT, FRAGILE BONES AND MENTAL DISORDERS. THIS REQUIRES MORE NUTRIENT-RICH FOODS AT OLDER AGE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN BALANCE OF NUTRIENTS, INCLUDING VITAMIN, TO KEEP THE BODY FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. THESE DEFICIENCIES CAN BE FULFILLED BY CONSUMING ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS. VITAMIN SUPPLEMENT IS ONE AMONG THE MAJORLY CONSUMED SUPPLEMENTS PRODUCTS AT LATER AGE. PEOPLE AGED 65 YEARS AND ABOVE ARE NOT MUCH EXPOSED TO SUN, ONE OF THE MAJOR SOURCE OF VITAMIN D.

27	JUST AS AFC WIMBLEDON THOUGHT THE STRUGGLE FOR A NEW STADIUM WAS NEARLY OVER, A GROUP OF CAMPAIGNERS ARE ARGUING FOR A NEW SECONDARY SCHOOL TO BE BUILT ON PLOUGH LANE. RESIDENTS SAY THAT THE AREA DESPERATELY NEEDS A SCHOOL, RATHER THAN A FOOTBALL STADIUM AND 600 NEW HOUSES THAT WILL PROVIDE "ZERO COMMUNITY BENEFIT." BUT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF AFC WIMBLEDON ERIK SAMUELSON INSISTS THE NEW PLANNING APPLICATION HAS ADDRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE STADIUM. FROM JULY: FOOTBALL STADIUM DECISION DELAYED AFTER AFC WIMBLEDON ALTERS PLANS COULD PLOUGH LANE LOOK LIKE THIS? THE FRONT OF AFC WIMBLEDON'S DEVELOPMENT IF PLANS ARE APPROVED.PHOTO: SHEPPARD ROBSON ARCHITECTS A CONSULTATION HAS BEEN LAUNCHED FOR COMMENTS ON THE REVISED APPLICATION, WHICH FEATURES SQUASH CLUB PARKING AND MORE CYCLE PARKING, A CAFE AND CRECHE, IMPROVEMENTS TO STREETS IN THE STADIUM SITE AND CHANGES TO THE DESIGN AESTHETICS. THE APPLICATION INCLUDES 601 NEW HOMES, AND CHANGES TO THE DESIGN OF THE 20,000 SEAT STADIUM, TO BEGIN AS 11,000 AND EXPANDED. BUT SOME NEIGHBOURS ARGUE THEY WOULD RATHER LIVE NEXT DOOR TO A SCHOOL THAN A FOOTBALL STADIUM. FROM DECEMBER 2014:GAME ON! DETAILS OF AFC WIMBLEDON'S STADIUM BID FINALLY REVEALED PROMOTED STORIES MR SAMUELSON, PICTURED ABOVE, SAID: "WE HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY THOROUGH AND WE BELIEVE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IT SHOULD SUCCEED, BUT OBVIOUSLY THATS UP TO THE COMMITTEE. "WE DONT TAKE THESE THINGS LIGHTLY, BECAUSE PEOPLE OBJECT WITH A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN MIND AND SO WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. "A SCHOOL ON THE SITE WOULD NOT WORK FINANCIALLY. WE HAVE COME UP WITH A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE. THE DEMAND IS NOT AS HIGH AS YOU WOULD THINK." FROM AUGUST: AFC WIMBLEDON LAUNCH CAMPAIGN TO GET GO-AHEAD ON SALE OF CHERRY RED RECORDS STADIUM RESIDENT JOY SANSUM DISAGREES. SHE SAID: "IM NOT DOING ANYTHING AGAINST THE FOOTBALL CLUB. I JUST THINK WE NEED A SCHOOL AROUND HERE AND I DONT THINK THERES BEEN A FAIR DEBATE. "IN THE CORRESPONDENCE WE HAVE HAD, ITS ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE KIND OF THE ONLY OPTION WOULD BE A FOOTBALL GROUND. "I DONT THINK THE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SUSTAIN IT." FROM MAY: 130 MILLION FOR HUGE SCHOOL EXPANSION PROGRAMME MERTON COUNCIL HAS PREVIOUSLY DISCOUNTED THE CURRENT WIMBLEDON GREYHOUND STADIUM IN PLOUGH LANE, WIMBLEDON, AS A POSSIBLE SITE FOR A NEW SECONDARY SCHOOL, DESPITE AN URGENT NEED FOR A NEW SCHOOL IN THE BOROUGH. A SITE FOR THE NEW SECONDARY, SAID TO BE IN THE SOUTH WIMBLEDON AREA, WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN OCTOBER. REASONS FOR REFUSING TO BUILD THE SCHOOL ON THE SITE INCLUDED THE SIZE, "POTENTIALLY DIFFICULT PLANNING ISSUES", PROXIMITY TO AN ELECTRICITY STATION AND A FLOODING RISK. THERE ARE ALSO CONCERNS THAT, BECAUSE THE SITE IS ON THE BORDER OF MERTON AND WANDSWORTH, MOST OF THE SCHOOL PLACES WOULD BE TAKEN BY WANDSWORTH PUPILS. THERE IS ALSO A SPORTS INTENSIFICATION DELEGATION ON THE SITE, TO ENSURE IT CONTINUES TO BE USED FOR PUBLIC SPORT, ALTHOUGH CAMPAIGNERS HAVE ARGUED THAT IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR SCHOOLS TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO USE THEIR SPORT FACILITIES OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL HOURS. ANOTHER LOCAL RESIDENT, WHO ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, SAID: "WHAT DO YOU THINK WE NEED MORE? WE DONT HAVE A CO-EDUCATIONAL SECONDARY SCHOOL IN THIS AREA, DO YOU THINK WE NEED A 20,000 SEAT STADIUM? "THEY WANT TO BUILD 600 HOMES AND DEVASTATE OUR LOCAL AREA WITH ROAD POLLUTION. "THIS SEEMS TO ME LIKE ITS ALL ALREADY BEEN FIGURED OUT AND THEY PREDETERMINED THE APPLICATION DECISION TO GIVE IT TO AFC WIMBLEDON." IN A FULL COUNCIL MEETING ON WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, CABINET MEMBER FOR EDUCATION COUNCILLOR MARTIN WHELTON SAID: "THE WIMBLEDON PARK GREYHOUND STADIUM WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED FOR THE SITE OF A NEW SCHOOL IN THE CAPITA SYMONDS REPORT BACK IN 2013. "IT WAS REJECTED BECAUSE ITS NOT FINANCIALLY VIABLE, ITS NOT AFFORDABLE AND IT WOULD ALSO PREVENT THE RETURN OF AFC WIMBLEDON TO THE BOROUGH. "WE HAVE A BIG ISSUE TO ADDRESS IN SCHOOL EXPANSION AND WIMBLEDON GREYHOUND STADIUM IS NOT THE ANSWER." HOWEVER, COUNCILLOR DAVID DEAN HAS ACCUSED THE COUNCIL OF NOT PROPOSING THE SITE TO THE GOVERNMENT. HE SAID: "THE COUNCIL DIDNT OFFER THE GOVERNMENT ALL THE OPTIONS. THE SITE ITSELF IS DESIGNATED FOR SPORT. NOT HOUSING, SPORT. AND SCHOOLS DO SPORT. "IF THE COUNCIL HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE, THEY WOULD SAY LETS PUT A FOOTBALL STADIUM AND A SCHOOL. "WHY ON EARTH WOULD THE COUNCIL NOT OFFER THE SITE TO THE SCHOOL? ITS COMMON SENSE." HE ALSO DISAGREED WITH COUNCILLOR WHELTONS CONCERNS ABOUT THE COST OF THE SITE, ADDING: "THE COUNCIL ISNT PAYING FOR IT. CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND THE TAX-PAYER ARE OFFERING TO PAY FOR THE SITE AND THE RUNNING OF THE SCHOOL. "MERTON COUNCIL WOULD SAVE 40 MILLION IF THEY SUPPORTED A SCHOOL. THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE BUYING AND BUILDING THE SCHOOL AND RUN THE SCHOOL. ITS BRILLIANT FOR THE MERTON TAX PAYER. "PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLACES GOING TO WANDSWORTH KIDS. I BELIEVE THOSE KIDS ARE HUMAN BEINGS. "THIS IS CENTRAL TAX-PAYERS MONEY. WE SHOULDNT BE SO CONCERNED ABOUT OUR BORDERS AND WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT CHILDREN AND THEIR EDUCATION."

28	( FAMILY FEATURES ) A BEAUTIFUL LAWN CAN BE THE FOUNDATION TO A HAPPY, HEALTHIER LIFE AND LEAD TO SPENDING MORE TIME OUTDOORS. IN FACT, 86 PERCENT OF AMERICANS CONSIDER THEIR LAWN IMPORTANT TO THEIR HOME AND LIFE. A HEALTHY LAWN ENCOURAGES YOU TO LIVE LIFE OUTSIDE MORE WITH YOUR FAMILY, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, SAID DR. KIRK HURTO, CHIEF SCIENCE OFFICER, TRUGREEN. THERES NO TIME LIKE LATE SUMMER AND EARLY FALL TO START PREPARING YOUR YARD FOR THOSE SPRING AND SUMMERTIME OUTDOOR GATHERINGS. WHILE A RECENT SURVEY CONDUCTED BY TRUGREEN SHOWED THAT SEVEN OUT OF 10 AMERICANS BELIEVE THEMSELVES TO BE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THEIR YARD, THE LAWN CARE EXPERTS AT TRUGREEN OFFER THESE HELPFUL REMINDERS TO GET YOUR YARD READY FOR FALL: AERATING AERATION INVOLVES REMOVAL OF SOIL CORES TO IMPROVE WATER AND AIR MOVEMENT IN COMPACTED SOILS, AND AIDS IN PROMOTING DEEPER AND MORE ROOT GROWTH AND THATCH MANAGEMENT. LONG TERM, YOUR LAWN WILL RESPOND QUICKER TO FERTILIZER AND WATER RUNOFF WILL BE REDUCED WHEN IRRIGATING. OVERSEEDING WHEN IT COMES TO INCREASING LAWN THICKNESS AND HEALTH, OVERSEEDING CAN BE ESSENTIAL. IT CAN HELP DISCOURAGE FUTURE WEEDS WHILE ALSO AIDING RECOVERY FROM SUMMER HEAT, DISEASE AND INSECT ACTIVITY. SEEDING DURING LATE SUMMER OR EARLY FALL WILL GIVE GRASS THE MAXIMUM TIME TO DEVELOP A DEEP EXTENSIVE ROOT SYSTEM AND MATURE BEFORE THE ONSET OF WINTER STRESSES. AERATION IS RECOMMENDED WHEN OVERSEEDING TO GIVE SEEDS MORE SOIL CONTACT AND PROVIDE A MOIST, PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT REQUIRED FOR GERMINATION. FEEDING FALL FEEDING GIVES YOUR LANDSCAPE THE NUTRIENTS NEEDED TO PREPARE FOR A HEALTHY, GREEN SPRING REVIVAL. HIRING A TRAINED SPECIALIST WITH A PLAN CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR REGION WILL HELP TREES AND SHRUBS THRIVE. IF YOU FERTILIZE YOUR OWN LAWN, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE PRODUCT DIRECTIONS AND SWEEP ALL FERTILIZER THAT MAY REACH PAVEMENT BACK ONTO YOUR LAWN. MAINTAINING HEALTH AND APPEARANCE THROUGHOUT THE FALL, THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAINTAIN YOUR YARDS APPEARANCE AND HEALTH, REMOVE FALLEN TREE LEAVES AND DEBRIS FROM YOUR LAWN. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN MULCHING TREE LEAVES BACK INTO YOUR LAWN EFFECTIVELY CLEARS AWAY TREE LEAF DEBRIS THAT OTHERWISE CAN BECOME MATTED AND DAMAGE YOUR LAWN OVER THE WINTER. LOWERING THE MOWER HEIGHT BY ONE OR TWO SETTINGS THE LAST COUPLE MOWINGS BEFORE WINTER REDUCES GRASS DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH SNOW. AVOID WALKING ON FROST-COVERED LAWNS AS DOING SO MAY CAUSE BROWN FOOTPRINTS TO APPEAR LATER THAT CAN REMAIN VISIBLE UNTIL SPRING. CLEAN AND EDGE LANDSCAPE BEDS, LEAVING NO MORE THAN 2-3 INCHES OF MULCH IN THE BEDS. PRUNING PRUNING IS AN ESSENTIAL MAINTENANCE PRACTICE FOR TREES AND SHRUBS. LANDSCAPES CAN QUICKLY BECOME OVERGROWN IF NOT CARED FOR, BUT YEARLY PRUNING WILL MAINTAIN TREES AND SHRUBS TO AN IDEAL SIZE AND SHAPE. REMOVE DEAD OR DAMAGED BRANCHES FROM TREES AND SHRUBS TO PREVENT ROT ORGANISMS FROM INVADING THE TRUNK AND STEMS OF PLANTS. FOR MORE FALL LAWN CARE AND MAINTENANCE ADVICE, VISIT TRUGREEN.COM .

29	BY LIAM PLEVEN FOR MONTHS, INVESTORS HAVE FRETTED OVER HOW A DECISION TO RAISE INTEREST RATES WOULD HURT REAL-ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS. NOW, THEY HAVE SOMETHING NEW TO WORRY ABOUT: HOW REITS WILL NAVIGATE THE STATUS QUO. THE SHARE PRICES OF REITS HAVE OUTPACED THE BROADER MARKET SINCE THE FEDERAL RESERVE DECIDED LAST WEEK TO KEEP RATES AT HISTORIC LOWS FOR A WHILE LONGER. ON MONDAY, THE MSCI US REIT INDEX ROSE 0.9%, LEAVING IT UP 1.7% SINCE THE DAY BEFORE THE FED DECISION WAS ANNOUNCED, COMPARED WITH A 1.4% DROP IN THE S&P 500. THE RECENT GAINS MARK A REVERSAL FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR, WHEN THE INDEX WAS TRAILING THE BROADER MARKET. THAT REFLECTED CONCERN THAT AN IMMINENT DECISION TO RAISE INTEREST RATES WOULD LEAD INVESTORS WHO ARE TYPICALLY DRAWN TO STEADY REIT DIVIDENDS TO VIEW BONDS AS INCREASINGLY ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVES. DESPITE THE RATE REPRIEVE, COMMERCIAL REAL-ESTATE FIRMS STILL FACE AN ARRAY OF CHALLENGES. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, WHILE IMPROVING, REMAINS CLOUDY. LAGGING SHARE PRICES MAKE IT HARDER TO RAISE MONEY AND GROW. AND UNCERTAINTY OVER WHEN INTEREST RATES ULTIMATELY WILL RISE--AND WHAT THE IMPACT MIGHT BE ON THEIR TENANTS AND THEIR INVESTORS--PERSISTS. THAT COULD TEMPER ENTHUSIASM FOR REIT SHARES IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD. THE IMMEDIATE REACTION TO THE FED'S DECISION WAS "A RELIEF RALLY, " SAID IAN WEISSMAN, HEAD OF REIT RESEARCH AT CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG. YET, HE ADDED, JUST BECAUSE THE FED ISN'T RAISING RATES AT THE MOMENT "DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GOING TO SEE THIS INFLUX OF CASH FROM GENERALIST INVESTORS." SOME REIT STOCKS HAVE RALLIED MORE STRONGLY THAN OTHERS IN THE WAKE OF THE FED'S DECISION. REAL-ESTATE COMPANIES THAT GIVE OUT LONG-TERM LEASES, SUCH AS HEALTH-CARE FACILITIES, HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE STRONGEST PERFORMERS IN RECENT DAYS. SHARES OF HEALTH CARE REIT INC., THE MOST VALUABLE REIT OF ITS KIND, ARE UP 5% SINCE WEDNESDAY'S CLOSE. HIGHER INTEREST RATES POSE A PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR SOME INVESTORS IN SUCH FIRMS BECAUSE THEIR LEASES MIGHT TAKE LONGER TO REFLECT THE CHANGE. THE FED'S DECISION--AND ITS STATEMENT THAT THE ECONOMY MIGHT NEED LOW RATES "FOR SOME TIME"--COULD EASE THAT CONCERN. OTHER REITS ARE MORE EXPOSED TO CONSUMER FINANCES OR THE BROADER ECONOMY, AND SOME HAVE SEEN MIXED TRADING IN RECENT DAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, SHARES OF SIMON PROPERTY GROUP INC., WHICH OPERATES MALLS AROUND THE COUNTRY, ROSE THURSDAY, FELL FRIDAY, AND ROSE MONDAY, LEAVING THEM UP 1.3% SINCE WEDNESDAY'S CLOSE. MANY REITS ARE ALSO CONTENDING WITH THE FALLOUT OF LAGGING SHARE PRICES. THE PULLBACK LEFT MANY TRADING AT A DISCOUNT TO WHAT THEIR REAL ESTATE WOULD FETCH ON THE PRIVATE MARKET, WHICH CAN ALSO COMPLICATE POTENTIAL MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. "M&A IS TOUGH IN THIS KIND OF ENVIRONMENT," SAID HAMID MOGHADAM, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF PROLOGIS INC., A LOGISTICS FIRM THAT OWNS INDUSTRIAL REAL ESTATE AROUND THE WORLD. INSTEAD, HE SAID, REITS WILL KEEP SELLING OFF ASSETS. "YOU CAN USE THAT CAPITAL TO BUY BACK YOUR STOCK," HE SAID. THIS SUMMER, PROLOGIS SAID IT WOULD SELL OFF UP TO $2.9 BILLION WORTH OF PROPERTY, UP FROM THE TARGET OF UP TO $2 BILLION IT HAD PROVIDED IN JANUARY. PROLOGIS SHARES ARE DOWN 10% THIS YEAR, BUT UP 2.5% SINCE THE DAY BEFORE THE FED ANNOUNCEMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, THE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS FOR MANY REITS ARE GOOD, SAID PAUL MORGAN, A MANAGING DIRECTOR AND ANALYST AT CANACCORD GENUITY. RENTS ARE RISING, WHILE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY IS MODERATE, WHICH LIMITS NEW SUPPLY OF BUILDINGS, HE SAID. "IT'S NOT OVERWHELMINGLY ROBUST," SAID MR. MORGAN. "IT'S WARM, BUT NOT HOT." INVESTORS MIGHT WANT TO SEE MORE CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND MORE CLARITY ABOUT WHERE INTEREST RATES ARE HEADED BEFORE THEY PUSH REIT STOCKS UP SIGNIFICANTLY. SHERIDAN SCHECHNER, AN INVESTMENT BANKER AT BARCLAYS WHO ADVISES REITS, SAID THAT EXECUTIVES ARE LOOKING FOR OTHER WAYS TO CREATE VALUE IN THE MEANTIME, INCLUDING PURSUING JOINT VENTURES AND TRYING TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS. MR. SCHECHNER SAID HE SUSPECTED THEIR ATTITUDE ABOUT HIGHER INTEREST RATES AMOUNTED TO "LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH." WRITE TO LIAM PLEVEN AT LIAM.PLEVEN@WSJ.COM

FOR HISTORIANS AND SCHOLARS INTERESTED IN GENDER ISSUES, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A CHANCE TO RECONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF GENDER-ASYMMETRICAL LAWS. FOR FAMILY LAW SCHOLARS, ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY HIGHLIGHTS THE CURRENT CAPACITY OF THE LAW TO RESHAPE WORK/FAMILY BALANCE.  OCT. TO ASSUME THAT IMPLEMENTING GENDER-ASYMMETRICAL RIGHTS IS THE BEST WAY TO HELP WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE OVERLOOKS THE POTENTIAL OF THE LAW TO AMELIORATE BROADER SOCIAL ISSUES. THESE INCLUDE THE WAY IN WHICH EMPLOYMENT IS TYPICALLY STRUCTURED TO ACCOMMODATE THE MOST PRIVILEGED EMPLOYEES AND HOW EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE ACCOMMODATING WORKPLACES.  AREHEART (UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF LAW) HAS POSTED ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY (ALABAMA LAW REVIEW, FORTHCOMING 2016) ON SSRN. HERE IS THE ABSTRACT: COURTS HAVE INTERPRETED THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA) AND THE PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION ACT (PDA) NOT TO AFFIRMATIVELY REQUIRE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PREGNANT WORKERS. THIS HAS GENERATED PROTEST AND LED ALL THREE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PREGNANCY RIGHTS. THE PREGNANT WORKERS FAIRNESS ACT IS PENDING IN CONGRESS AND HAS DRAWN STRONG VOCAL SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. THE U.S.  UPS, WHICH FOUND THE PDA DOES NOT AFFIRMATIVELY REQUIRE PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS. FINALLY, MANY COMMENTATORS HAVE ARGUED IN SUPPORT OF CONSIDERING PREGNANCY A DISABILITY UNDER THE ADA. THIS ARTICLE AGREES SUBSTANTIVELY WITH THE END OF ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY, BUT DISAGREES WITH THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS COMMENTATORS HAVE ADVANCED.  IN PARTICULAR, CHARACTERIZING PREGNANCY AS A DISABILITY OR PREGNANT WOMEN AS A CLASS IN SPECIAL NEED OF ACCOMMODATION POSES A DANGER OF EXPRESSIVE HARMS. CURRENTLY PROPOSED MEASURES MAY REVITALIZE EXCLUSIONARY AND PATERNALISTIC ATTITUDES TOWARD PREGNANT EMPLOYEES, SIGNAL INCAPACITY TO WORK, OR ACTUALLY INCREASE SEX DISCRIMINATION. WE SHOULD THUS CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EXPRESSIVE IMPACT OF PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATION SCHEMES IN LIGHT OF CURRENT SOCIAL NORMS IN WHICH PREGNANT WOMEN ARE GENERALLY SEEN AS CAPABLE OF PRODUCTIVE WORK. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO SECURING PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS THAT WOULD AVOID EXPRESSIVE HARMS AND EMPLOY A GENDER SYMMETRICAL APPROACH. THIS ARTICLES CRITIQUE AND THE QUESTION OF HOW BEST TO ACCOMMODATE PREGNANCY RESONATE ACROSS SEVERAL AREAS OF THE LAW.

I MAY HAVE EFFED UP A MILLION OTHER THINGS ABOUT PARENTING, BUT I KNOW IN MY HEART THAT THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE DONE RIGHT. THE LAST TIME I WAS IN SCHOOL WAS BEFORE SHE WAS BORN, SO THIS TIME AROUND I'M LEARNING TO BE A STUDENT ALL OVER AGAIN. THE LATE NIGHTS OF CRAMMING ARE HARDER TO DO WHEN I KNOW MY DAUGHTER WILL WAKE UP AT 6 THE NEXT MORNING AND NEED ME TO HELP HER GET READY FOR HER OWN SCHOOL DAY. THE TEXTBOOKS ARE A LITTLE HARDER TO PORE THROUGH WHEN CURIOUS GEORGE IS PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND AFTER SCHOOL OR WHEN I'M SITTING DOWN TO HELP HER WORK ON A PROJECT. STILL, WE PRESS ON. EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE WITH A STEEP LEARNING CURVE, I TREASURE THE WAY SHE LOOKS AT ME AND SMILES WHEN I SIT DOWN NEXT TO HER WITH A BOOK IN MY HANDS. IT'S LIKE SHE KNOWS AND IS PROUD TOO. MORE: PROFESSOR TEACHES COLLEGE CLASS WITH SINGLE MOM'S SON ON HIS HIP (PHOTO) SHE FELT PROUD DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL WHEN SHE THREW HER "PACK-PACK" OVER HER SHOULDERS, STUFFED FULL OF "HOMEWORK" THAT SHE HAD COMPLETED, JUST LIKE MOMMY. I FELT PROUD WHEN A PROFESSOR GAVE ME PERMISSION TO BRING HER HOME SICK WITH A MILD VIRUS TO THE UNIVERSITY SO I COULD TAKE A QUIZ WHILE SHE RESTED IN MY LAP. SHE FELT PROUD WHEN SHE ANNOUNCED TO HER PRE-K TEACHER THAT HER MOMMY WAS GOING TO SCHOOL TOO. I FELT PROUD WHEN I BROUGHT HER TO A DOCTORAL PROGRAM PARTY, WHERE SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE A HOST OF OTHER STUDENT MOTHERS WHO HAVE LIKEWISE PLACED A HIGH VALUE ON THEIR EDUCATION AND HAVE BROUGHT THEIR CHILDREN ALONG FOR THE RIDE. MORE: DAD'S FORMER JOB GETS HIS KID KICKED OUT OF KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION IS A BEAUTIFUL THING. I HAVE FELT THIS WAY ALL ALONG, BUT MY REVERENCE FOR EDUCATION HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY AS I'VE PARTICIPATED IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS WITH A LITTLE ONE WATCHING ME. IT IS ONE THING TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN THE VALUE OF A GOOD EDUCATION AND ENTIRELY ANOTHER THING TO LIVE OUT THE VALUE OF IT BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES. I KNOW NOT ALL PARENTS CAN AFFORD WITH EITHER TIME OR MONEY TO RETURN TO A FORMAL EDUCATION, BUT I TRULY BELIEVE THAT OBTAINING A PARTICULAR DEGREE ISN'T EXACTLY THE POINT, ANYWAY. THE POINT IS TEACHING OUR CHILDREN THAT THE HUMAN BRAIN IS THE MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE AND THAT THE GROWTH OF OUR INTELLECT AND INTELLIGENCE IS NOT AN OPTION IT IS A DUTY AND A PRIVILEGE. AND FOR ME, AS A SINGLE PARENT, IT IS THE RESOURCE THAT NO ONE CAN TAKE AWAY FROM ME AND THAT I WILL USE TO PROVIDE MY CHILD WITH THE LIFE I WANT FOR HER.

33	UPDATE - TAKING A GOOD PANORAMA IMAGE IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.  MOST OF THE TIME SOFTWARE SYSTEMS LIKE PHOTOSHOP CAN HANDLE STITCHING CORRECTLY, AND PRODUCE BEAUTIFUL VISTAS. OCCASIONALLY HOWEVER, THINGS GO WRONG. HAVE YOU EVER HAD A SERIES OF IMAGES WHERE THE LINES DONT MEET UP CORRECTLY, OR ANGLES REFUSE TO SYNC? MOST OF THE TIME WE HAVE TO DISCARD PANORAMAS LIKE THIS, OR GO THROUGH COMPLEX, TIME-CONSUMING EDITING PROCESSES TO GET A CLEAN, NATURAL-LOOKING IMAGE.  HE LEARNED MANY ONONDAGA WORDS IN KINDERGARTEN, ACCORDING TO HIS GRANDMOTHER, CAROLINE TOUSE. LUCKILY, THIS PROBLEM CAN BE LARGELY ELIMINATEDBY UNDERSTANDING PARALLAX ERROR AND USING A PANORAMA HEAD ON YOUR TRIPOD. LAKE QUELLACOCHA, PERU LIES AT AN ALTITUDE OF 4350 METRES. IMAGE BY TEAGAN CUNNIFFE. FIRSTLY, WHAT IS PARALLAX ERROR? THIS EXERCISE IS ONE WAY TO UNDERSTAND IT: HOLD YOUR INDEX FINGER IN FRONT OF YOUR NOSE, AND THEN TAKE TURNS IN CLOSING ONE EYE, AND THEN THE OTHER. NOTICE HOW YOUR FINGER APPEARS TO MOVE?NEXT, KEEP BOTH EYES OPEN AND MOVE YOUR HEAD SLOWLY FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, KEEPING AN EYE ON THE BACKGROUND AND HOW YOUR FINGER SEEMS TO SHIFT IN RELATION TO IT.THATS PARALLAX ERROR. PARALLAX IS A DISPLACEMENT OR DIFFERENCE IN THE APPARENT POSITION OF AN OBJECT VIEWED ALONG TWO DIFFERENT LINES OF SIGHT, AND IS MEASURED BY THE ANGLE OR SEMI-ANGLE OF INCLINATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO LINES.NEARBY OBJECTS HAVE A LARGER PARALLAX THAN MORE DISTANT OBJECTS WHEN OBSERVED FROM DIFFERENT POSITIONS.  SOMETIMES A SINGLE MISTAKE IS ENOUGH TO LEAD THEM TO ETERNAL DAMNATION.  HE SAYS JUST THIS SUMMER A SCHOOL IN TRACADIE BEACH, LA VILLA DES AMIS, WAS EVACUATED AFTER A CONTRACTOR WORKING ON THE HOT WATER TANK FOUND ASBESTOS. IN PRACTICAL TERMS, THIS MEANS THAT WHEN YOU PANYOUR CAMERATO TAKE A SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS TO LATER STITCH INTO A PANORAMA, THE ACT OFSWEEPING YOUR LENS FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER CAUSES YOUR CAMERA TO RECORD DIFFERENT ANGLES TO A SINGLE OBJECT. WHEN IT COMES TO STITCHING, SOFTWARE CANT FILL IN THE GAPS AND LEAVES THAT PART OF THE IMAGE DISCONNECTED. THIS HAPPENS MAINLY WITH OBJECTS CLOSER TO YOUR LENS. THE EASIEST WAY TO FIX THIS IS BY FINDING YOUR CAMERAS NODAL POINT. THE NODAL POINTIS WHERE LIGHT RAYS ENTERING YOUR LENS CONVERGE AND YOUR CENTRE OF PERSPECTIVE IS FOUND. TO CONTROL FOR PARALLAX ERROR, YOULL NEED TO KEEP YOUR LENS IN A FIXED POSITION AND INSTEAD ROTATE YOUR CAMERA AROUND THE LENS. YOU WILL NEED A PANORAMA HEAD ON YOUR TRIPOD TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS PROPERLY. NOTICE HOW THE NODAL POINT, THE SPHERE OF LIGHT INTO THE LENS, STAYS IN THE SAME PLACE AS THE CAMERA IS ROTATED.

CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH AL RESSLER DURING THE SKILL SETUP: CHOOSING THE RIGHT TRAINING FOR THE RIGHT TASK SESSION DURING THE GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE: LEARNING INNOVATIONS CONFERENCE. THERE ARE MANY TRAINING METHODS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYEE EDUCATION WITHIN A GOVERNNMENT AGENCY: ONLINE COURSEWARE; VIRTUAL CLASSROOM; IN-PERSON, TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT; OR A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE. WHATEVER THE CHOICE, AN ORGANIQZATIONS FUTURE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES SHOULD BE THE TRAINING MISSION, WITH THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL FRONT AND CENTER. IDEALLY, AN EMPLOYEES INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN WOULD MESH WITH THE AGENCYS VISION AND ITS OPERATIONAL NECESSITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INDIVIDUALS CAREER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. A ROBUST AND WELL-DESIGNED TRAINING PROGRAM THAT CONSIDERS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND TALENT GAPS IS ALSO RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL.  THAT PROGRAM INCLUDED MANDATORY CLASSES, FUNCTIONAL HUMAN RESOURCES TRAINING, AND A TWO-YEAR JROTATIONAL ASSIGNMENT WITH A MANDATORY GEOGRAPHIC MOVE. FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE, I DID NOT KNOW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF WORKING IN A FEDERAL ORGANIZATION, BUT THE TRAINING PROGRAM GAVE ME THE FOUNDATIONAL EDUCATION I NEEDED TO BOTH PERFORM MY JOB WELL AND ADVANCE MY FUTURE CAREER.

MEANWHILE, THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN INVALUABLE AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE NETWORKING TOOL.
35	BETSY SAID THE DOCTOR TRIED HER BEST TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS HAPPENING. "SHE USED ALL THESE MEDICAL TERMS, AND THEN EVENTUALLY SAID, 'WHAT SHE'S TELLING YOU, IS THAT SHE'S DYING, AND THERE'S NOT ANYTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.'" KURT CHIMED IN, SAYING, "IT WAS PRETTY MUCH GUT-WRENCHING. IT WAS UH...YEAH." WHILE TALKING ABOUT IT CAN LEAVE THEM SPEECHLESS, AT TIMES, THAT'S THE LAST THING KURT AND BETSY WANT OTHERS AROUND THEM TO BE.  "BUT ACTING LIKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN DOESN'T HELP," BETSY SAID. "AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO." THE MILLERS ARE NOT ALONE IN THEIR JOURNEY. METHODIST WOMEN'S HOSPITAL HOLDS A "REMEMBRANCE OF LIFE" CEREMONY, EVERY YEAR, FOR OTHER GRIEVING FAMILIES. IT'S A KICK-OFF TO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS WARENESS MONTH, WHICH IS OCTOBER - A TIME TO REMEMBER. "I REMEMBER JUST LAYING ON THE COUCH AFTER COMING HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL, AND THINKING, 'I'M NEVER GOING TO FEEL BETTER,'" BETSY SAID. AND A TIME TO HEAL. "I LIKE TO SAY THAT YOU DON'T MOVE ON, BUT YOU MOVE FORWARD." SUNDAY'S "REMEMBRANCE OF LIFE" CEREMONY MARKS THE FIRST OF MANY EVENTS, SALTED FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER. A 5K RUN/WALK IS SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 9TH ALONG THE KEYSTONE TRAIL. IT'LL BE PUT ON BY HEALING EMBRACE.

"BUT WHEN SHE MEASURED MY STOMACH WITH A TAPE MEASURE," BETSY SAID, "I WAS THE SAME SIZE THAT MY STOMACH HAD BEEN THE APPOINTMENT PRIOR." AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION WAS IN ORDER. BABY OLIVIA WAS WELCOMED TO THE WORLD WEIGHING JUST TWO POUNDS.

36	HIS SIZE ISN'T IDEAL, BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER POSITIVES FOR UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING TRUE FRESHMAN OFFENSIVE TACKLE ZACH WALLACE. WALLACE WAS NAMED A STARTER THIS WEEK AT RIGHT TACKLE FOR UW'S GAME AT WASHINGTON STATE ON SATURDAY. WALLACE REPLACES SOPHOMORE TAYLOR KNESTIS, WHO SUFFERED A CONCUSSION IN THE COWBOYS' 48-29 LOSS TO EASTERN MICHIGAN LAST SATURDAY. WALLACE CAME IN WHEN KNESTIS GOT HURT IN THE SECOND HALF. HE ALSO PLAYED SOME IN UW'S OPENER TWO WEEKS AGO AGAINST NORTH DAKOTA. AT 6-FOOT-7, WALLACE FITS THE MOLD OF MANY OFFENSIVE TACKLES. BUT HE WEIGHS JUST 265 POUNDS, WHICH IS 40 TO 50 POUNDS LIGHTER THAN MOST WHO PLAY AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL. BUT AS THE SAYING GOES, SIZE ISN'T EVERYTHING. "HE'S REALLY BRIGHT AND HAS GOOD FOOTBALL INSTINCTS," SECOND-YEAR UW COACH CRAIG BOHL SAID. "WHILE HE'S LIGHT, HIS FRAME IS SUCH THAT HE'S ABLE TO PLAY STRONGER THAN HIS FRAME INDICATES. "THERE HAVE BEEN SOME FRESHMAN ERRORS, BUT I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW VALUABLE THOSE GAME REPS ARE FOR A TRUE FRESHMAN. HE'S SHOWN HE CAN COMPETE, AND HE'S NOT SHIED AWAY FROM COMPETITION." WALLACE IS FROM LAKE ZURICH, ILLINOIS, AND COMMITTED TO UW IN THE SUMMER OF 2014. HE SAID UW COACHES FIRST DISCOVERED HIM AT THE NORTHWESTERN SHOWCASE IN ILLINOIS, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO A RECRUITING COMBINE FOR HIGH SCHOOL PLAYERS. WALLACE WAS GIVEN A THREE-STAR RATING OUT OF FIVE BY ESPN.COM COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL, AND IT ALSO RANKED HIM AS THE NO. 44 RECRUIT TO COME OUT OF ILLINOIS LAST YEAR. HE WAS ONE OF 18 PLAYERS TO BE NAMED TO THE 2014 ILLINOIS ALL-STATE CLASS 7A TEAM BY THE ILLINOIS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACHES ASSOCIATION. CLASS 7A IS THE SECOND-LARGEST HIGH SCHOOL CLASSIFICATION IN THE STATE. WALLACE EXPECTED TO REDSHIRT THIS SEASON BASED ON HIS WEIGHT. THAT CHANGED WHEN FALL CAMP STARTED IN EARLY AUGUST. "DURING FALL CAMP, I STARTED WITH THE SECOND GROUP, THEN AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS, I STARTED GETTING SOME REPS WITH THE FIRST STRING," WALLACE SAID. "THAT'S WHEN I HAD A FEELING I WOULD PLAY THIS YEAR." AS CAMP PROGRESSED, OFFENSIVE LINE COACH SCOTT FUCHS KNEW WALLACE WOULD SEE SOME PLAYING TIME. NOW BEING THRUST INTO THE STARTING LINEUP, FUCHS REMAINS CONFIDENT IN WALLACE'S ABILITIES. "WITH HIM, THAT'S NOT A WORRY," FUCHS SAID WHEN ASKED IF UW HAS TO SIMPLIFY ITS OFFENSE SOME BY HAVING A TRUE FRESHMAN START ALONG THE OFFENSIVE LINE. "HIS INTELLIGENCE REALLY HELPS HIM OUT. HE'S VERY CALM ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD. HE'S NOT FRANTIC. HE DOESN'T PANIC. HE'S VERY EVEN KEEL. "HE UNDERSTANDS THE PLAY CONCEPTS VERY WELL FOR A TRUE FRESHMAN. WE HAD TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAME PLANS FOR OUR FIRST TWO GAMES, AND HE HANDLED BOTH WELL. HE'S A REAL COACHABLE KID. HE WILL ONLY GET BETTER THE MORE GAME REPS HE GETS AND THE MORE HE'S IN THE WEIGHT ROOM." MAINTAINING HIS WEIGHT WILL BE AN EMPHASIS FOR WALLACE AS THE SEASON PROGRESSES. AS FOR MAKING HIS FIRST START, WALLACE SAID HE DOESN'T FEEL ANY DIFFERENT THAN HE DID THE LAST TWO WEEKS AS A BACKUP. "IT'S THE SAME MINDSET. YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR ASSIGNMENTS AND GET THINGS DONE," HE SAID. FUCHS SAID TRUE FRESHMAN OFFENSIVE GUARD KADEN JACKSON IS THE FIRST GUARD THAT WILL COME OFF THE BENCH ON EITHER SIDE THIS WEEK. JACKSON PLAYED ABOUT FIVE SNAPS LAST WEEK AGAINST EASTERN MICHIGAN, THE FIRST PLAYING TIME OF HIS CAREER. "WE WILL INCORPORATE HIM MORE AS SEASON GOES ON," FUCHS SAID.

38	PIETERMARITZBURG - THE SENTENCING OF TWO MEN FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE MURDER OF PIETERMARITZBURG DOCTOR BHAVISH SEWRAM HAS BROUGHT HIS FAMILY A STEP CLOSER TO FINDING OUT THE TRUTH BEHIND HIS KILLING. THIS WAS ACCORDING TO SEWRAMS WIDOW YUVADIA AS EX-POLICEMAN BRIAN TREASURER, 55, AND MFANISENI NXUMALO, 37, WERE FOUND GUILTY ON THURSDAY OF HIS MURDER AND SENTENCED TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT. AN EMOTIONAL YUVADIA SAID SHE WAS HAPPY JUDGE ANTON VAN ZYL HAD TAKEN A FIRM STANCE AGAINST HER LATE HUSBANDS KILLERS. SHE SAID THE NEXT STAGE IN GETTING CLOSURE WOULD BE THE OUTCOME OF THE TRIAL OF THE ALLEGED MASTERMIND OF THE MURDER, BUSINESSMAN RAJIVEE SONI, WHOSE CASE RESUMES BEFORE A DIFFERENT JUDGE ON SEPTEMBER 28. SONI WAS NAMED BY NXUMALO AS BEING THE FRIEND ON WHOSE BEHALF TREASURER SAID HE WAS ASKED TO HAVE SEWRAM KILLED BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WAS IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE. THE COURT HAD ALSO HEARD FROM TREASURER THAT HE HAD ACCIDENTALLY PLACED A CALL TO SONI FROM HIS CAR ON THE NIGHT THE DOCTOR WAS KILLED. THIS WAS ONE ASPECT OF TREASURERS EVIDENCE THAT VAN ZYL SAID WAS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE. THE JUDGE SAID IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS A PRINCIPAL, WHETHER IT WAS SONI OR SOMEONE ELSE, BEHIND SEWRAMS MURDER, WHO HAD OFFERED TREASURER AND NXUMALO SOME BENEFIT TO ARRANGE THE DOCTORS KILLING. THE EVIDENCE OF THE ACTUAL SHOOTER, SABELO DLAMINI, REVEALED HE WAS PAID R12 000 FOR THE MURDER, BUT IT WAS NOT KNOWN HOW TREASURER AND NXUMALO HAD BENEFITTED. THE JUDGE FOUND THAT THE MEN DESERVED LIFE SENTENCES AS NEITHER HAD SHOWN ANY REMORSE, AND HAD TAKEN THE LIFE OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING AFTER CAREFUL PLANNING AND PRE-MEDITATION. THE MEN WERE EACH ALSO SENTENCED TO ADDITIONAL SENTENCES OF 15 YEARS IMPRISONMENT FOR JOINT POSSESSION OF THE GUN USED TO SHOOT THE DOCTOR, BUT THIS SENTENCE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY RUN CONCURRENTLY WITH THE LIFE TERMS. VAN ZYL REFUSED TO GRANT TREASURER AND NXUMALO LEAVE TO APPEAL THEIR CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES, SAYING ANOTHER COURT WAS UNLIKELY TO COME TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS. THIS ALSO MEANT THAT TREASURER HAD NO GROUNDS TO BE GRANTED AN EXTENSION OF HIS BAIL, AS REQUESTED BY HIS ATTORNEY BOB BAHADUR. SEWRAMS PARENTS, PARMANAND AND NALINI SEWRAM, SAID THE JUDGMENT AND SENTENCE HAD RESTORED THEIR FAITH IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, EVEN THOUGH THE PAIN OF LOSING THEIR SON WOULD REMAIN FOREVER. JUDGE VAN ZYL SAID THE OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF CCTV FOOTAGE SHOWING TREASURERS MOVEMENTS ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION, AND THE PROBABILITIES, ALL POINTED TO HIS GUILT. HE ACCEPTED AS RELIABLE AND TRUTHFUL THE EVIDENCE OF DLAMINI, WHO TESTIFIED THAT TREASURER HAD HANDED HIM THE COCKED FIREARM BEFORE THE SHOOTING, AND EXPLAINED TO HIM IN GREAT DETAIL HOW TO AMBUSH SEWRAM. THESE DETAILS INCLUDED WHEN THE DOCTOR WOULD SWITCH OFF THE LIGHT IN HIS SURGERY, LOCK UP THE PREMISES AND MAKE HIS WAY TO HIS CAR PARKED OUTSIDE, WHERE HE SHOULD BE SHOT. THE JUDGE SAID THIS SHOWED THAT SEWRAM HAD BEEN CAREFULLY WATCHED TO ESTABLISH HIS MOVEMENTS AND REVEALED THE PLANNING INVOLVED IN HIS MURDER. VAN ZYL REJECTED NXUMALO AND TREASURERS EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAD BEEN INNOCENT ROLEPLAYERS. HE SAID IT WAS AGGRAVATING THAT NEITHER OF THEM WAS INDIGENT OR STARVING. TREASURER HAD SAID HE WAS A PENSIONER RECEIVING A GRANT OF R7 000 AFTER BEING MEDICALLY BOARDED BY THE POLICE SERVICE. HE HAD ALSO TESTIFIED TO HAVING ACCESS TO CASH, GIVING HIS FISHING BUDDY R72 000 TO KEEP ON HIS BEHALF PRIOR TO HIS ARREST. TREASURER HAD TOLD THE COURT HE GAMBLED AND PLAYED THE HORSES, IMPLYING THESE WERE PROFITABLE PURSUITS, SAID THE JUDGE. HE SAID NXUMALO, THOUGH ORPHANED AT A YOUNG AGE, HAVING A GRADE TWO EDUCATION AND BEING ILLITERATE, HAD ALSO MADE SOMETHING OF HIMSELF AND HAD HIS OWN GRASS-CUTTING BUSINESS AND OTHER MACHINERY. JUDGE VAN ZYL SAID THE DOCTORS MURDER HAD AFFECTED MANY LIVES. ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE TRAUMA THE DECEASEDS [DOCTORS] FATHER MUST HAVE EXPERIENCED WHEN HE IDENTIFIED THE BODY OF HIS SON IN THE MORTUARY. HE SAID THE FAMILIES OF THE TWO ACCUSED WOULD ALSO SUFFER.

39	TORONTO: ONCE AGAIN, CANADA RANKS AMONG THE WORLDS MOST ECONOMICALLY FREE COUNTRIES, RANKING NINTH OVERALL ACCORDING TO THE FRASER INSTITUTES ANNUAL ECONOMIC FREEDOM OF THE WORLD REPORT. THE REPORT MEASURES THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM (LEVELS OF PERSONAL CHOICE, ABILITY TO ENTER MARKETS, SECURITY OF PRIVATELY OWNED PROPERTY, RULE OF LAW, ETC.) BY ANALYZING THE POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS OF 157 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES. ECONOMIC FREEDOM BREEDS PROSPERITY AND ECONOMICALLY FREE COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA OFFER THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF LIFE WHILE THE LOWEST-RANKED COUNTRIES ARE USUALLY BURDENED BY OPPRESSIVE REGIMES THAT LIMIT THE FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY OF THEIR CITIZENS, SAID FRED MCMAHON, DR. MICHAEL A. WALKER RESEARCH CHAIR IN ECONOMIC FREEDOM WITH THE FRASER INSTITUTE. CANADA DROPPED TWO SPOTS IN THIS YEARS RANKINGS, TO NINTH FROM SEVENTH. THE UNITED STATES, ONCE CONSIDERED A BASTION OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, RANKS 16TH IN THE WORLD. A WEAKENED RULE OF LAW, THE SO-CALLED WARS ON TERRORISM AND DRUGS, AND A CONFUSED REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HAVE HELPED ERODE ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH REMAINS BEHIND CANADA AND OTHER MORE ECONOMICALLY FREE COUNTRIES SUCH AS QATAR, JORDAN AND THE U.A.E., MCMAHON SAID ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, BASED ON 2013 STATISTICS (THE MOST RECENT YEAR OF AVAILABLE DATA), THE TOP 10 MOST ECONOMICALLY FREE JURISDICTIONS ARE HONG KONG (WHICH CONTINUES ITS STREAK OF NUMBER ONE RANKINGS), SINGAPORE, NEW ZEALAND, SWITZERLAND, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, MAURITIUS, JORDAN, IRELAND AND CANADA, WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CHILE TIED FOR 10TH. HONG KONG REMAINS NUMBER ONE BUT BECAUSE DEMOCRACY IS THE BEST SAFEGUARD OF FREEDOM, IF CHINA, WHICH RANKS LOW IN ECONOMIC FREEDOM, ENCROACHES ON HONG KONG, WE CAN EXPECT HONG KONGS RANKING TO FALL, MCMAHON SAID. OTHER NOTABLE RANKINGS INCLUDE JAPAN (26), GERMANY (29), RUSSIA (99), CHINA (111) AND INDIA (114). THE 10 LOWEST-RANKED COUNTRIES ARE ANGOLA, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, ZIMBABWE, ALGERIA, ARGENTINA, SYRIA, CHAD, LIBYA, REPUBLIC OF CONGO, AND VENEZUELA. SOME DESPOTIC COUNTRIES SUCH AS NORTH KOREA AND CUBA CANT BE RANKED DUE TO LACK OF DATA. GLOBALLY, THE AVERAGE ECONOMIC FREEDOM SCORE ROSE SLIGHTLY TO 6.86 OUT OF 10 FROM 6.84 LAST YEAR. ACCORDING TO RESEARCH IN TOP PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS, PEOPLE LIVING IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM ENJOY GREATER PROSPERITY, MORE POLITICAL AND CIVIL LIBERTIES, AND LONGER LIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, COUNTRIES IN THE TOP QUARTILE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM HAD AN AVERAGE PER-CAPITA GDP OF US$38,601 IN 2013, COMPARED TO US$6,986 FOR BOTTOM QUARTILE NATIONS.

41	LAST POST IN THIS THREAD I MENTIONED THAT I HAD OBTAINED SOME 'HONDURAN' MAHOGANY FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD ON THE CABINET. I WASN'T ENTIRELY PLEASED WITH THE MATERIAL I RECEIVED AS I HAD WANTED QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY, WHILE 7 OUT OF THE 10 BOARDS RECEIVED WERE NOT FITTING THAT DESCRIPTION AT ALL. I REALIZE NOW THAT QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY IS NOT GENERALLY WHAT WAS BEING CUT - LOGS ARE INVARIABLY SAWN THROUGH AND THROUGH - AND THUS QS STOCK IS LESS COMMONLY AVAILABLE THAN I HAD THOUGHT. SO, TRYING TO OBTAIN MORE (IN BULK) IN THE HOPE OF SCORING SOME MORE QUARTERSAWN BOARDS WAS NOT LOOKING PROMISING. NONE OF THE RETAILERS I SPOKE WITH SEEMED EVEN WILLING TO DO A SORT FOR A FEW BOARDS, AND FAIR ENOUGH. AFTER FURTHER RUMINATION, I DECIDED IT WOULD BE BEST TO CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SPECIES FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD, A SPECIES THAT WAS TYPICALLY CUT FOR QUARTERSAWN FROM THE GET-GO AND WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD MATCH FOR THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE REST OF THE CABINET. I'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED WOODS SUCH AS MAHOGANY, BLACK CHERRY, AND SWISS PEAR WOOD FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD. NONE OF THOSE WERE LIKELY TO FIT THE REQUIREMENTS I HAD IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION, SO I KEPT LOOKING. I FINALLY CAME ACROSS A SUITABLE MATERIAL, AND IT IS BOTANICALLY RELATED TO BUBINGA (WHICH IS GUIBORTIA TESSMANII OR GUIBORTIA PELLAGRINIANA OR GUIBORTIA DEMEUSEI). THIS IS A WOOD CALLED SHEDUA, AKA OVANGKOL, WHICH COMES FROM THE SPECIES GUIBORTIA EHIE. THIS IS A SOMEWHAT SMALLER TREE THAN THOSE SPECIES FROM WHICH BUBINGA IS OBTAINED, HOWEVER IN MANY RESPECTS SHEDUA SHARES THE SAME WORKING QUALITIES AS BUBINGA. THE WOOD COMES FROM WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES LIKE GABON AND CAMEROON, AND THE TREE IS MORE COMMONLY UTILIZED FOR ITS GUM RESIN, CALLED CONGO COPAL, THAN ITS TIMBER. THE TIMBER IS NOT VERY COMMONLY AVAILABLE, AND DOES SEEM TO FIND A CERTAIN FAVOR AMONG THE GUITAR-MAKING COMMUNITY. HERE'S A GUITAR WITH A SHEDUA BACK: (FROM:HTTP://WWW.GUITARBENCH.COM/2012/01/04/SHEDUA-TONEWOOD-PROFILE/) AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS A MORE BROWNISH CAST THAN BUBINGA, BUT SHARES THE BLACK STREAKS. COMPARING SHEDUA'S MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WITH BUBINGA, IT IS VERY CLOSE INDEED, BEING VERY SLIGHTLY LIGHTER AND DENSER, A LITTLE LOWER IN VOLUMETRIC CHANGE DUE TO MOISTURE CONTENT CHANGE, A SLIGHT BIT SOFTER IN TERMS OF CRUSHING STRENGTH AND A HAIR STIFFER IN BENDING STRENGTH (MODULUS OF ELASTICITY). I IMAGINE, THEREFORE, THAT IT SHOULD HAVE FAIRLY SIMILAR WORKING QUALITIES TO BUBINGA. THIS IMAGE FROM HEARNE HARDWOODS SHOWS THE VARIED APPEARANCE OF SHEDUA BASED ON THE GRAIN ORIENTATION: AS IT SO HAPPENS, HEARNE WAS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THE US WHICH HAD ANY STOCK OF SHEDUA AT ALL, LET ALONE QS AND/OR FIGURED STOCK. IN FACT, THEY HAD A DECENTLY SIZED STACK OF 12/4 MATERIAL, 6~12" WIDE, 16' LONG OR LONGER, AND SOME OF IT WAS QUARTERSAWN. CONSIDERING FEW OTHER RETAILERS HAVE ANY OF THIS MATERIAL, IT WAS AMAZING TO COME ACROSS SUCH NICE STOCK. THEY ALSO TOOK TIME TO REPLY TO MY EMAILS, AND SEND PICTURES, ONCE I HAD DEMONSTRATED SOLID INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL - - AND HAD GIVEN THEM MY CREDIT CARD INFO! THEY SEEM TO BE A WOOD RETAILER SPECIALIZING IN HIGH QUALITY AND RARE MATERIALS. THEY SENT ME SOME PICTURES OF A COUPLE OF BOARDS WHICH MATCHED THE REQUIREMENTS I GAVE THEM, SWABBED WITH ALCOHOL TO MAKE THE FIGURE A BIT CLEARER THOUGH NOT SHOWING THE TONE WHICH WILL BE OBTAINED WITH A PROPER FINISH: THEY WERE WONDERING IF I WAS SO DETERMINED TO HAVE QUARTERSAWN BECAUSE I WAS A LUTHIER, HOWEVER I LET THEM KNOW THEY WERE GUESSING WRONG. I DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC REASONS FOR WANTING QUARTERSAWN MATERIAL OF COURSE. THE GUY WHO SENT ME THE PICTURES STATED THAT THESE TWO BOARDS MIGHT BE THE NICEST IN THE ENTIRE PILE. I ASKED FOR A FOLLOW-UP PIC OF THE END GRAIN OF THE TWO BOARDS, TO CONFIRM THEY WERE WHAT I WANTED IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION: AND THE OTHER BOARD, ABOUT 12" WIDE: THE STICKS ARE HARD TO SCALE UNTIL YOU NOTICE THAT A FORKLIFT IS DOING THE LIFTING.... THE STOCK LOOKED GOOD TO ME. THE PRICE WAS STEEP, AT $35/BOARD FOOT, SO EACH OF THOSE BOARDS WAS $1400.00, HOWEVER I WAS ABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE COST SOMEWHAT BY SELLING A PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY-ACQUIRED MAHOGANY OFF TO ANOTHER WOODWORKER IN MY BUILDING. I ORDERED THOSE TWO BOARDS AND THEY SHOULD BE AT MY SHOP IN ANOTHER 3~4 DAYS. I THINK THIS WOOD WILL GO VERY NICELY WITH THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE BULK OF THE CABINET: I THINK THE CAD REPRESENTATION OF THE SHEDUA IS APPROXIMATE AT BEST. IN RECENT DAYS I HAVE REVISED THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DIVIDERS ON THE LOWER BANK OF DRAWERS, MAKING THEM STRAIGHT INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM MATCH THE DRAWER CURVES, AND RECESSING THEM BACK SLIGHTLY - THIS FOR AMONG OTHER REASONS, TO INCREASE THE SHADOW LINE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE CURVED DRAWERS AND THE SURROUNDING FRAMEWORK: THE DIVIDER'S OUTER ARRISES WILL ADDITIONALLY BE CHAMFERED. THE DRAWERS THEMSELVES WILL HAVE A BEADED PERIMETER DETAIL, AND HAVE THE DRAWER SIDEWALL THROUGH- TENONS POKING OUT, NEITHER OF WHICH IS NOT ILLUSTRATED YET, AND THE HANDLE DESIGN FOR THE DRAWERS REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION. LIKEWISE, THE UPPER SET OF DRAWERS AND DOORS REMAINS JUST A FRONTAL PLANE AT THE MOMENT WITH NO ALLOWANCE FOR SET BACK, CHAMFERING, ETC.. GETTING THERE! THANKS FOR VISITING THE CARPENTRY WAY. GOT SOME MACHINE'S COMING SOON SO I AM WORKING ON GETTING MY SHOP READY FOR THAT - THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE SUBJECT OF THE NEXT POST.
42	CATERHAM PHOTOGRAPHER 'CHASING THE PERFECT PICTURE' TALKS ABOUT HER CAREER CAPTURING ARTISTS ON TOUR 16:48, 22 SEP 2015 UPDATED 16:49, 22 SEP 2015 BY AMANIHUGHES, CHRISTIE GOODWIN HAS BEEN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS SINCE THE AGE OF 12 AND HAS BUILT UP AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY CAPTURING TOP RECORDING ARTISTS ON TOUR VIEW GALLERY FROM THE LIKES OF KATY PERRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND ONE DIRECTION, THIS PHOTOGRAPHER FROM CATERHAM HAS CAPTURED A HEAP OF FAMOUS NAMES AND IS CONTINUING HER SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT PICTURE. CHRISTIE GOODWIN, A BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHER, WHOSE CAREER SPANS MORE THAN 35 YEARS, STARTED TAKING PICTURES AT THE AGE OF 12 AND WAS BOUGHT HER FIRST CAMERA AT 13. SHE GRADUATED FROM THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS IN ANTWERP AND GOT HER FIRST JOB IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY, EVOLVING TOWARDS EDITORIAL AND WORKING FOR NEWS AGENCIES BEFORE ENDING UP IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND TAKING PICTURES OF ARTISTS ON TOUR. CHRISTIE'S PORTFOLIO IS A WHO'S WHO OF TOP NAMES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, INCLUDING KATY PERRY, ED SHEERAN, USHER, TAYLOR SWIFT, ONE DIRECTION, SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY AND KYLIE MINOGUE, AMONG MANY OTHERS. SHE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME ON TOUR CAPTURING IMAGES OF ARTISTS WHICH APPEAR ON CDS, DVDS, TOUR MERCHANDISE, POSTERS, INTERNATIONAL PUBLICATIONS, BOOKS AND EXHIBITIONS. EVEN THOUGH CHRISTIE HAS BEEN ON TOUR WITH MANY ARTISTS SHE ADMITTED SHE IS STILL ON THE HUNT FOR THE ELUSIVE PERFECT PICTURE. THE THING I HAVE BEEN CHASING IS THE PERFECT PICTURE, IT KEEPS ME GOING, TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT, CHRISTIE SAID. PHOTOGRAPHY IS BASICALLY ONE MOMENT IN TIME AND YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL TO OTHERS, THAT'S WHY YOU CAPTURE IT, TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE WHAT YOU FELT AND WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED. I WANT TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT IN TIME, IF I SHOOT A SHOW I WANT THE VIEWER TO FEEL LIKE THEY WERE THERE, THAT WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT A PICTURE THEY FEEL THE MUSIC AND FEEL THE CROWD. THAT'S WHAT I AIM FOR IN MY PHOTOGRAPHY. @CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE EXPLAINED OUT OF ALL THE TOURS SHE HAS CAPTURED, KATY PERRY'S PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR WAS THE MOST EXCITING. I STARTED DOING THE REHEARSALS SO I ACTUALLY SAW THE SHOW BUILD UP TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE END, I SPEND TWO TO THREE WEEKS ON THE SHOW. IT WAS REALLY EXCITING TO SEE HOW SOMETHING COMES TO LIFE. THROUGHOUT HER ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER CHRISTIE HAS CAPTURED SOME POWERFUL IMAGES, FROM BB KING AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL TO SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY STRUMMING A GUITAR. HOWEVER SHE EXPLAINED HER FAVOURITE MOMENT TAKEN SO FAR WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF KATY PERRY DURING HER PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR. AN IMAGE WHICH IS NOW ICONIC AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD TO PUBLICISE THE TOUR. IN THE SHOW IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE FIREWORKS WERE BEHIND HER, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN, CHRISTIE SAID. THE MOMENT THE FIREWORKS GO, YOU GET TO SHOOT THREE FRAMES, SHE DIDN'T HAVE HER HEAD AROUND, THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE FIREWORKS. THAT FRAME HAS MADE HISTORY AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD, IT WAS A LUCKY SHOT AND I WAS HAPPY THAT WE GOT IT. ALWAYS ON THE MOVE EVEN THOUGH PHOTOGRAPHING FAMOUS ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS SOUNDS EXCITING AND CONSTANTLY DIFFERENT, CHRISTIE ASSURED IT WAS NOT ALWAYS GLAMOROUS, AS YOU ARE ALWAYS ON THE MOVE AND NEVER IN ONE PLACE FOR VERY LONG. WHEN YOU DO NOT TRAVEL, IT'S VERY EXCITING BUT WHEN YOU TRAVEL ALL THE TIME, LITTLE THINGS START TO BOTHER YOU, YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR LAUNDRY AND YOU ARE NOT IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG TIME, IT'S A DRAG. HOWEVER IN CONTRAST TO THIS CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE EASILY GETS BORED AND ITCHY FEET WHEN SHE COMES HOME TO CATERHAM AND IS EAGER TO GET OFF TO HER NEXT DESTINATION AND NEXT TOUR. THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS I DO ENJOY, YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES, SLEEP IN YOUR OWN BED, BUT AFTER THREE DAYS I WANT TO GO AGAIN, I GET BORED. WHEN I AM ON THE ROAD, I WANT TO BE BACK AT HOME AND WHEN I'M HOME I WANT TO BE ON THE ROAD. I CANNOT LIVE AT HOME, I WOULD GET BORED, BUT YOU ALSO CANNOT BE ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME, I NEED A COMBINATION OF THE TWO. WHEN ASKED IF SHE COULD IMAGINE HER LIFE TAKING A DIFFERENT PATH, CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED DOING ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN PHOTOGRAPHY. I COULD NOT BE ANYTHING ELSE, WHEN I PICK UP A CAMERA, IT'S JUST ME AND THE CAMERA, IT'S PART OF ME, IT'S WHO I AM, I CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT THE CAMERA. TAKE PHOTOS LIKE A PRO CHRISTIE HAS TEAMED UP WITH CURRYS PC WORLD TO HELP MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR CAMERA EQUIPMENT AND PROVIDES HER TOP TIPS ON HOW TO CAPTURE PHOTOGRAPHS AT FESTIVALS, FROM TAKING THE PERFECT FESTIVAL SELFIE, LOOKING TO NAVIGATE OBSTRUCTIVE CROWDS OR CAPTURING FAST-MOVING STAGE ACTION. PLAN AHEAD: LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE, KNOW WHICH ARTISTS YOU WANT TO SHOOT, AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT IF YOU WISH TO PHOTOGRAPH BANDS ON DIFFERENT STAGES, YOU NEED TO GET THERE IN TIME. ALSO PREPARE FOR THE FACT THAT THEY MIGHT NOT START EXACTLY WHEN THEYRE SUPPOSED TO. I ALWAYS CARRY MY OWN FESTIVAL SCHEDULE ON MY PHONE. SHOOTING MY FIRST BIG FESTIVAL EARLY ON IN MY CAREER, I NEARLY MISSED AC/DC, BECAUSE I WASNT PREPARED! BE PREPARED: MAKE SURE YOU BRING ENOUGH MEMORY CARDS AND BATTERY POWER TO LAST ALL THE WAY. CHANCES ARE YOU WONT HAVE ANYWHERE TO CHARGE THEM FOR HOURS AND YOU DONT WANT TO RUN OUT JUST BEFORE YOUR FAVOURITE BAND IS ON. KEEP THEM IN A LITTLE POUCH WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES AND MAKE SURE ITS WATERPROOF, SO YOU DONT BECOME VICTIM TO FAILING CAMERA EQUIPMENT. COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS: FESTIVAL STAGES CAN BE QUITE MESSY AND CLUTTERY, SO TAKE THE TIME TO COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS. LOOK FOR ANGLES WHERE YOU CAN AVOID PEOPLE OR OBJECTS THAT WILL MAKE THE PHOTO LOOK A MESS. FESTIVAL STAGES CAN ALSO BE VERY HIGH, ESPECIALLY THE MAIN STAGE, SO IT CAN EVEN BE A CHALLENGE FOR US PROS IN THE PHOTO PIT IN FRONT OF THE STAGE. BUT MAKE SURE YOU WAIT FOR THOSE MOMENTS WHEN YOUR FAVOURITE SINGER IS RIGHT AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE THATS WHERE YOU GET YOUR BEST SHOTS. REMEMBER THE CROWD: SOME OF MY BEST SHOTS ARE NOT OF THE ARTISTS BUT OF PEOPLE IN THE CROWD. THE CROWD OFTEN MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE AND CAN BRING TO LIFE THAT FEELING YOU GET BEING AT A FESTIVAL. THE GO PRO HERO 4 OR EE 4GEE ACTION CAM ARE GREAT FOR THIS KIND OF SHOT DUE TO THEIR ULTRA-WIDE ANGLE LENSES FOR A UNIQUE CROWD VIEW. WHEN YOU DO THIS, TRY TO HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER OR EVEN LOWER, PLAY WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES. MAKE SURE TO ALSO TAKE AT LEAST ONE LONG WALK AROUND THE WHOLE FESTIVAL GROUND TO HELP YOU FIND THE PERFECT SUBJECTS. MIND THE RAIN: FESTIVALS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR EVER-CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS. PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEOPLE IN THE MUD ARE TOKEN FESTIVAL SHOTS. HAVING RAIN VISIBLE IN THE SHOT CAN ADD SOMETHING INTERESTING, SO DONT TAKE IT AS A BAD THING. I NEVER GO TO A FESTIVAL WITHOUT A PLASTIC BAG TO PROTECT MY GEAR, AND HAVING A WATERPROOF CASE OR AN ACTUAL WATERPROOF CAMERA LIKE THE FUJIFILM XP80 CAN HELP TO CATER FOR ANY WEATHER CHANGE. CONSIDER YOUR LENSES: CHANGING LENSES IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD CAN BE A NIGHTMARE. DUST, MUD, THE BOOTS OF A CROWDSURFER AND AN AIRBOURNE CUP OF BEER HAVE A WAY OF FINDING YOU THE TIME YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LENS. PRACTICE CHANGING THE LENS UNDER A PLASTIC BAG OR UNDER YOUR JACKET. BECOME A FESTIVAL SELFIE KING OR QUEEN: IF YOURE GOING TO TAKE A SELFIE, MAKE SURE THE SELFIE TELLS A STORY. YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE OF YOURSELF, OR YOU CAN TAKE A FEW EXTRA SECONDS AND FRAME THAT SELFIE A LITTLE BETTER, GET SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THE SHOT, OR SOMETHING ANNOYING OUT OF IT. TAKE YOUR TIME, LOOK AROUND, AND MAYBE HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER SO THAT YOU HAVE THE WHOLE FESTIVAL IN THE BACKGROUND. IF YOU TAKE A LOT OF SELFIES, THE COMPACT PANASONIC TZ57 HAS A SELFIE SCREEN AND WI-FI SO YOU CAN POST IT ON THE WEB IMMEDIATELY. THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT: WHEN YOU TAKE PHOTOS OF YOUR FRIENDS, OR WHEN YOU TAKE SELFIES, TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT. IF THE SUN IS BEHIND THE PERSON IN THE PHOTO, THEIR FACE WILL BE DARKER. ITS NOT A BAD IDEA TO USE A FLASH IF YOURE SHOOTING AGAINST THE LIGHT, EVEN ON A SUNNY DAY. OR DO THE OPPOSITE, SHOOT AGAINST THE LIGHT AND PLAY WITH DARK SILHOUETTES. YOU DONT NEED A PRO CAMERA TO GET AN AMAZING SHOT LIKE THAT. TAKE IN THE VIEW: IT CAN BE REALLY FUN TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT LENSES. A FISH-EYE OR WIDE-ANGLE LENS CAN REALLY HELP CAPTURE THE SCALE OF THE FESTIVAL. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE FUN. A FISH-EYE IS A PRIME LENS, MEANING THAT YOU CANT ZOOM IN OR OUT WITH IT. THEREFORE, ITS UP TO YOU TO ACT AS THE ZOOM FOR THE LENS. BE SURE TO CHANGE PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES AND LINES. GET DOWN LOW TO THE GROUND, EVEN IF IT MEANS LAYING ON YOUR STOMACH IN WHATS LEFT OF THE FESTIVAL GRASS. LEAN UP AGAINST A WALL AND USE THE DISTORTION OF THE LENS TO WRAP THE WALL AROUND THE FRAME. JUST HAVE FUN! BE AWARE THAT IF YOU FRAME A CLOSE UP OF A PERSON NEAR THE OUTER EDGES OF A WIDE ANGLE OR FISH-EYE SHOT, THEIR FACE CAN BE STRETCHED OUT. KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT: THIS ONE IS CRUCIAL. GETTING A NEW CAMERA WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT FEATURES IS TEMPTING, BUT MAKE SURE YOU LEARN HOW TO USE THEM. WALK THROUGH THE MANUAL GUIDE AND TEST IT ALL OUT. IT MIGHT SEEM A BIT TEDIOUS TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE STEPS BUT EVEN THE PRO PHOTOGRAPHER TAKES HIS TIME TO LEARN TO KNOW THEIR CAMERA. ONCE YOU KNOW ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF YOUR CAMERA AND HOW TO USE THEM THEN THERE IS NOTHING STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND THAT PERFECT SHOT. CHRISTIE ADDED TO TAKE MANY PHOTOS, AS IT IS THE VOLUME THAT MATTERS AND GET TO KNOW YOUR CAMERA. DO NOT SHOOT ON THE AUTOMATIC, PUT YOUR CAMERA ON MANUAL AND TEST IT OUT, YOU CANNOT LET THE CAMERA THINK FOR YOU, YOU HAVE TO THINK FOR THE CAMERA AND SHOOT WHAT YOU WANT.

"WE HAVEN'T STARTED THE GAME WELL, AND OBVIOUSLY THAT NEEDS TO GET FIXED -- AND IT NEEDS TO GET FIXED TOMORROW," TANNEHILL SAID. THE DOLPHINS (1-2) WERE OUTGAINED 200-39 BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT A SMATTERING OF BOOS. THEY BECAME LOUDER AS THE TEAM TROTTED INTO THE LOCKER ROOM AT HALFTIME DOWN BY 27. "OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT TO START A LITTLE FASTER, ELIMINATE BIG PLAYS AND GO FROM THERE," DEFENSIVE TACKLE NDAMUKONG SUH SAID. "THE LAST THREE GAMES, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DICTATING TO US, AND IT'S PUT US IN A TOUGH SPOT." THE DOLPHINS FINALLY MOUNTED A DRIVE IN THEIR FIRST POSSESSON OF THE SECOND HALF, GOING 56 YARDS ON SIX PLAYS AND SCORING ON A 21-YARD PASS FROM TANNEHILL TO RISHARD MATTHEWS. TANNEHILL HIT JARVIS LANDRY FOR A TWO-POINT CONVERSION TO MAKE IT 27-8. BUT ANOTHER FORMER DOLPHIN, EX-PRACTICE SQUAD RECEIVER CHRIS HOGAN, HELPED THE BILLS STRETCH THEIR LEAD AGAIN, PULLING DOWNA 38-YARD TD PASS FROM TAYLOR. MATTHEWS (6 CATCHES, 113 YARDS) HAULED IN ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN PASS ON A 46-YARD HEAVE FROM TANNEHILL WITH 7:56 REMAINING. BUT IT WAS ONLY WINDOW DRESSING, AND ROOKIE KICKER ANDREW FRANKS ADDED A BIT MORE EMBARRASSMENT BY MISSING THE ENSUING EXTRA POINT. ON THE SECOND SNAP AFTER A FAILED ONSIDE KICK, BILLS RUNNING BACK KARLOS WILLIAMS RACED 41 YARDS FOR ANOTHER BUFFALO SCORE. BY THAT POINT, THE BILLS HAD ALREADY PULLED TAYLOR FOR BACKUP EJ MANUEL. THE DOLPHINS WILL TRY ANOTHER CHANGE OF SCENERY NEXT WEEK, WHEN THEY TRAVEL 4,400 MILES TO LONDON TO FACE THE NEW YORK JETS. "I WISH WE WERE PLAYING BETTER, BUT WE ARE WHAT WE ARE RIGHT NOW," COACH JOE PHILBIN SAID. "THERE'S NO MAGIC POTION. IF THERE WAS A MAGIC POTION, I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT IT OUT ALREADY."

44	OVER ON SATURDAY, I EXPRESSED SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW I FELT I WAS GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF MANY PEOPLE IN MY GENERATION ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS. I OBSERVED THAT I SEEMED TO BE GROWING OUT OF GEEK CULTURE AND DID SO LARGELY BEFORE GEEK CULTURE BECAME ALL THE RAGE. I READ COMIC BOOKS AS A KID AND STILL HAVE MY COLLECTION IN MY MOMS ATTIC. I ALSO WAS AN ANIME FANATIC AND DID A FAIR BIT OF GAMING IN TERMS OF VIDEO GAMES, BOARD GAMES, AND TABLE TOP RPGS. BUT THIS ALL DIED OUT. MY INTEREST IN ANIME WANED WHEN I WAS IN MY EARLY 20S. I WILL GO SEE A MIYAZAKI MOVIE BUT HAVE NO REAL DESIRE TO SEE ANY ANIME BEYOND THAT. GAMING MIGHT BE SOMETHING I TRY EVERY NOW AND THEN BUT I OFTEN GET BORED BEFORE COMPLETING GAMES. SOMETIMES I CAN PLAY SOMETHING FROM MY YOUTH FOR NOSTALGIAS SAKE. SOMETIMES I WILL BUY A NEW GAME AND TRY IT FOR ANOTHER GO. COMIC BOOKS DONT INTEREST ME ANYMORE AND I WILL SEE SOME OF THE BIG BLOCKBUSTERS BUT AM CONTENT WITH WAITING TILL THEY COME OUT ON DVD. THE WHOLE MIDNIGHT RELEASE THING IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME. A 24-HOUR MARVEL MOVIE MARATHON IS ESPECIALLY NOT FOR ME AS I LIKE MY SLEEP AND STARRING AT A SCREEN FOR TOO LONG HURTS MY EYES. WHAT BEWILDERS ME IS THAT AS I LEFT GEEK CULTURE, GEEK CULTURE SEEMS TO HAVE EXPLODED. I SEE PEOPLE I KNEW FROM COLLEGE TALK ABOUT THEIR DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS CAMPAIGNS, PAST AND PRESENT. ID BET MONEY THAT IF YOU ASKED THESE PEOPLE WHETHER THEY EVER PLAYED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS IN COLLEGE, THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LOT OF ADAMANT DENIALS. I SEE PEOPLE GEEKING OUT ABOUT ATTENDING COMIC CON WHO I KNOW WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT DISDAIN AND CONTEMPT FOR COMIC CON DURING THEIR YOUNGER YEARS. THIS IS ALL VERY STRANGE TO ME. WHAT MEMO DID THESE PEOPLE GET THAT TOLD THEM NOW IS THE TIME TO ADMIT TO BEING A GEEK? WHERE DID THEY LEARN TO HIDE ALL OF THIS FROM 18-22 BACK IN THE LATE NINETIES AND EARLY AUGHTS? JAYBIRD OFFERED THIS PHILOSOPHICAL OBSERVATION: ONCE YOU ABANDON AESTHETICS IN SERVICE TO A CULTURE-WIDE GUSTIBUS NON EST DISPUTANDUM MOMENT, YOURE SUDDENLY FINDING THAT THERES NO REAL REASON TO EVER LEAVE SAFE/COMFORTABLE ENTERTAINMENT SPACES. WHY WOULD YOU? GUSTIBUS NON EST DISPUTANDUM TRANSLATES AS IN MATTERS OF TASTES, THERE CAN BE NO DISPUTES. I AM NOT SURE I FULLY AGREE WITH THIS. WHEN DID CULTURE DECIDE THAT THIS WAS HOW WE ARE GOING TO PROCEED WITH ISSUES OF CULTURE, AESTHETICS, AND TASTES? I DONT REMEMBER THIS BEING A CONVERSATION. I WOULD ALSO COUNTER THAT THIS CULTURAL MAXIM IS NOT TOTALLY TRUE BECAUSE WE DONT REALLY HAVE A DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS KIND OF ATTITUDE. JAYBIRD OBSERVED OR BELIEVED THAT A BELIEF IN THE LATIN MAXIM WOULD OR SHOULD LEAD EVERYONE STAYING IN THEIR CULTURAL SAFE/COMFORT ZONE. MANY PEOPLE MIGHT USE THIS MAXIM AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR DOING SO. BUT THERE IS STILL A SUSPECT CLASS AND THAT SUSPECT CLASS BECOMES THOSE (WHO IN ANYWAY) CHOOSE TO VENTURE OUT OF THE CULTURALLY WIDESPREAD AND MAINSTREAM INTO AREAS OF NICHE OR MAINLY HIGH CULTURE. THE NEW ATTITUDE BECOMES A BIT OF A PURPOSEFULLY ANTI-INTELLECTUAL ONE. JAMES JOYCE? NO ONE REALLY ENJOYS JAMES JOYCE. PEOPLE ONLY SAY THEY DO TO SEEM INTELLIGENT. JAMES JOYCE IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE. YOU CAN REPLACE JOYCE WITH SHOSTAKOVICH, PLAYS THAT ARE NOT MUSICALS AND/OR THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, ALMOST ANY BOOK TAUGHT TO ENGLISH LITERATURE MAJORS, TRUFFAUT OR OZU MOVIES, ETC. THERE SEEMS TO BE A GOOD CHUNK OF MODERN SOCIETY THAT THINKS ANY AND ALL FORMS OF HIGH CULTURE OR NON POP-CULTURE IS MERELY AN AFFECTION, NOW GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE, AND JUST PUT ON A DAMN BATMAN T-SHIRT AND TALK ABOUT GEEKING OUT LIKE THE REST OF US. SO THE MAXIM FAILS BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO MUCH A STATEMENT OF WELCOMING AND RELATIVE SUBJECTIVITY OR DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS BUT A WEAPON USED IN DEFENSE OF POP CULTURE AND FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF WHATEVER CAN BE PART OF HIGH-CULTURE AND AVANT-GARDE CULTURE. I WOULD AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS TO LIKE EVERY MEDIUM, GENRE, ARTISTS, ETC. I KNOW PEOPLE WHO STRESS OUT ABOUT THE IDEA OF SUBTEXT IN LITERATURE BUT CAN LOOK AT A KANDINSKY PAINTING FOR HOURS AND ANALYZE EVERY BIT, BUT I DONT THINK THAT THIS SHOULD TURN INTO AN ANTI-INTELLECTUAL EXERCISE OF COME ON, YOU DONT REALLY LIKE RAVELS SOLO PIANO WORK, DO YOU? THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY TO EXPLAIN THAT I SINCERELY FIND RAVELS MUSIC TO BE REALLY PRETTY AND WONDERFUL TO LISTEN TO. THE MUSIC IS ENCHANTING BUT ALSO HAS A MELANCHOLY FEEL, A WISTFULNESS AND FLEETING SENSATION THAT ONE DOES NOT FIND IN MANY OTHER PLACES. HOW DOES ONE PROVE SINCERITY HERE AND WHY IS IT SO SEEMINGLY HARD TO DO? EVERY NOW AND THEN SOMEONE WILL GET A REALIZATION AND MAKE AN EXCLAMATION ALONG THE LINES OF WOW! YOU REALLY DO LIKE ALL THIS HIGH CULTURE STUFF AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT NEVER OCCURRED TO THEM THAT PEOPLE MIGHT LIKE HIGH CULTURE SINCERELY. AS FOR JAYBIRDS QUESTION ABOUT WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE YOUR CULTURAL COMFORT/SAFE ZONES BECAUSE THERE IS A WHOLE WORLD AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF CULTURE OUT THERE. I GET THE POINT OF REREADING BOOKS OR WATCHING MOVIES MORE THAN ONCE. YOU PICK UP ON DIFFERENT THINGS. BUT WHY READ TOLKIEN FOR THE ONE HUNDREDTH TIME WHEN YOU CAN FIND A NEW FORM OF NOVEL OR A NEW AUTHOR? I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO READ ALL THAT I WANT IN MY LIFETIME OR SEE EVERY THEATER PRODUCTION THAT I WANT TO SEE. I GET BORED TOO QUICKLY BY THE SAME STUFF. THIS CAN ALSO INCLUDE EATING THE SAME MEAL OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO MAKE SUNDAY A BIG COOKING DAY AND THEY DIVIDE THAT SUNDAY MEAL INTO 5 OR 6 PORTIONS FOR THE WEEK. THIS BORES ME. BY THE SECOND OR THIRD DAY, I AM TIRED OF EATING THE SAME FOOD.
45	THERE ARE MANY TRAINING METHODS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYEE EDUCATION WITHIN A GOVERNMENT AGENCY: ONLINE COURSEWARE; VIRTUAL CLASSROOM; IN-PERSON, TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT; OR A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE. WHATEVER THE CHOICE, AN ORGANIZATIONS FUTURE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES SHOULD BE THE TRAINING MISSION, WITH THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL FRONT AND CENTER. IDEALLY, AN EMPLOYEES INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN WOULD MESH WITH THE AGENCYS VISION AND ITS OPERATIONAL NECESSITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INDIVIDUALS  CAREER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. A ROBUST AND WELL-DESIGNED TRAINING PROGRAM THAT CONSIDERS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND TALENT GAPS IS ALSO AN EFFECTIVE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL. CASE IN POINT AS A COLLEGE GRADUATE, I ENTERED A SOPHISTICATED ARMY CIVILIAN TRAINING PROGRAM IN WHAT HAS NOW EVOLVED INTO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. THAT PROGRAM INCLUDED MANDATORY CLASSES, FUNCTIONAL HUMAN RESOURCES TRAINING, AND A TWO-YEAR ROTATIONAL ASSIGNMENT WITH A MANDATORY GEOGRAPHIC MOVE. FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE, I DID NOT KNOW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF WORKING IN A FEDERAL ORGANIZATION, BUT THE TRAINING PROGRAM GAVE ME THE FOUNDATIONAL EDUCATION I NEEDED TO BOTH PERFORM MY JOB WELL AND ADVANCE MY FUTURE CAREER. INDEED, IT HELPED ME BECOME THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE WHO WAS AN ASSET TO MY ORGANIZATIONS FUTURE. MATCHING METHOD TO GOALS AS FAR AS SPECIFIC LEARNING METHODS GO, NONE STAND OUT AS SUPERIOR. INDIVIDUAL NEEDS, LEARNING STYLES, AND ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN DECIDING WHICH EDUCATIONAL TOOLS WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES. FOR INSTANCE, TOTAL IMMERSION MAY NOT ALWAYS GIVE THE BEST RESULT, AS SOME EMPLOYEES MAY BE MORE APT TO LEARN IN A HANDS-ON ENVIRONMENT OR THROUGH SMALLER BURSTS OF INFORMATION.  CONSEQUENTLY, SPENDING TIME LEARNING WITH PEERS IN AN EMPLOYEES SAME DISCIPLINE OR AREA OF INTEREST CAN RESULT IN LASTING SUPPORT AND SYNERGY THAT ENDURES THROUGHOUT AND BEYOND FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT.  HOW ARE YOU DESIGNING YOUR TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MEET FUTURE AGENCY GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS? CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH AL RESSLER DURING THE SKILL SETUP: CHOOSING THE RIGHT TRAINING FOR THE RIGHT TASK SESSION DURING THE GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE:  LEARNING INNOVATIONS CONFERENCE.
46	LEADING PARAPLANNING FIRM, SVENSONI , WHO HAVE THEIR HEAD OFFICE IN SWINDON HAVE INCREASED THEIR HEADCOUNT AGAIN AND FURTHER DEMONSTRATED THEIR COMMITMENT TO FUTURE FINANCIAL SERVICES TALENT WITH THE HIRING OF THEIR THIRD APPRENTICE. THE COMPANY LAUNCHED IN 2010 AND NOW BOASTS OVER 250 CLIENTS THROUGHOUT THE UK RANGING FROM SINGLE ADVISERS TO LARGE FIRMS AND NETWORKS. AS WELL AS A NOTABLE CLIENT BANK THE COMPANY BOASTS A 97% PASS FIRST TIME RATE AND VAST KNOWLEDGE IN ALL AREAS OF FINANCIAL PLANNING. CEO, TONY STEVENS PUTS THIS INDUSTRY LEADING QUALITY DOWN TO THEIR IN DEPTH AND ONGOING COMMITMENT TO TRAINING AS WELL AS A CULTURE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL. TONY SAID:WE FIRMLY BELIEVE IN OUR PEOPLE AND STRIVE TO DEVELOP THEM AND THEIR FUTURE CAREERS. THE QUALITY OF OUR PEOPLE IS WHAT DRIVES THE QUALITY OF OUR BUSINESS, WITHOUT QUALITY PEOPLE OUR BUSINESS WOULD NOT HAVE GROWN TO WHAT IT IS TODAY. OUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMME HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC SUCCESS FOR US AS WELL AS BEING A UNIQUE, CHALLENGING AND VERY WORTHY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE APPRENTICES. IN A TIME WHEN THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION TO DEVELOP A CAREER THAT WILL ALLOW THEM MANY OPTIONS IN LIFE IT IS VERY SATISFYING TO WATCH THEM DEVELOP AND GROW AS INDIVIDUALS, EACH WITH VARYING SKILL SETS AND ABILITIES. SVENSONIS LATEST HIRING ON THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMME IS 17 YEAR OLD EMILLIE SUTER WHO JOINS THE COMPANY AFTER SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVING HER AAT AT COLLEGE. EMILLIE SAID: THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED TO ME BY SVENSONI IS SOMETHING THAT I AM REALLY GRATEFUL FOR, THE BUSINESS AND THE PEOPLE IN IT HAVE BROADENED MY HORIZONS ON THE ASPECT OF PARAPLANNING AND HOW IT IS ASSOCIATED WITHIN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY; WHICH WAS AN UNTOUCHED SUBJECT WITHIN MY COURSE. I FEEL WELCOMED INTO THE COMPANY AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM TO FURTHER MY SKILLS. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE APPRENTICES IN THE LONG TERM IS CENTRED ON BECOMING PARAPLANNERS.

47	COMMENTS(0) CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION VENUES THAT COMBINE STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITIES WITH STUNNING SURROUNDING SCENERY ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. NEIGHBOURING GLOUCESTERSHIRE THERE IS JUST SUCH A SITE, WHERE THE 21ST CENTURY BLENDS SEAMLESSLY WITH GROUNDS STEEPED IN TRADITION AS A PLACE WHERE EVENTS HAVE BEEN STAGED AND PEOPLE HAVE MET TO DO BUSINESS FOR DECADES. THE THREE COUNTIES SHOWGROUND AT MALVERN HAS COME A LONG WAY OVER THOSE DECADES, DEVELOPING SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS TO MEET CONTEMPORARY DEMAND FOR BUSINESS EVENTS. THE STRIKING THREE COUNTIES CENTRE, PURPOSE BUILT FOR CONFERENCES AND EXHIBITIONS, OPENED ONLY IN 2011, IS A VERSATILE VENUE, THAT CAN HOST EVENTS ATTRACTING FROM 2,000 TO TENS OF PEOPLE, DEPENDING ON WHAT ORGANISERS REQUIRE. THE DESCRIPTION OF ITS SPACE AS "A BLANK CANVAS" IS APT, AS IT CAN BE CUSTOMISED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TO STAGE ANYTHING FROM SMALL CONFERENCES TO FUNDRAISING BALLS, TRADE SHOWS, PHOTO SHOOTS, FASHION SHOWS AND LARGE VEHICLE EXHIBITIONS. THE LARGEST SPACE, ON THE GROUND FLOOR, SEVERN HALL, CAN ACCOMMODATE EXHIBITIONS, BUSINESS EXPOS AND LARGE CONFERENCES.

FREE WI-FI IS AVAILABLE ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE SHOWGROUND TO KEEP PEOPLE IN TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER ON OR OFF SITE. GLOUCESTERSHIRE'S KEY ROLE IN THE ROYAL THREE COUNTIES SHOW IS LONGSTANDING AND THE COUNTY'S CONNECTIONS DO NOT END THERE. THE ROYAL WAS ADDED TO THE SHOW'S TITLE IN 2013, THE YEAR THE GLOUCESTERSHIRE-BASED PRINCESS ROYAL BECAME THE SHOW'S PATRON. SHE HAS BEEN A FREQUENT VISITOR OVER THE YEARS. THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE THREE COUNTIES AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY, KEN NOTTAGE, WAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF GLOUCESTER RUGBY IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TAKING UP HIS CURRENT POST. ALL OF THOSE ASSOCIATIONS POINT TO A CLOSE AFFINITY BETWEEN GLOUCESTERSHIRE AND THE THREE COUNTIES SHOWGROUND, WHICH IS UNDERLINED BY THEIR PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER. THE SHOWGROUND IS ONLY AROUND HALF AN HOUR FROM CHELTENHAM AND IT IS WITHIN EASY REACH OF A VARIETY OF STARTING DESTINATIONS. ITS CENTRAL LOCATION MEANS IT IS 15 MINUTES FROM THE M5'S JUNCTIONS 7 AND 8 AND THE M50'S JUNCTION 1.

A SHUTTLE BUS IS AVAILABLE FROM THE STATION ON REQUEST. BIRMINGHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IS JUST 50 MINUTES AWAY AND BRISTOL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 90 MINUTES. FOR ANYONE DRIVING TO AN EVENT AT THE SHOWGROUND THERE IS THE ADDED BONUS OF FREE PARKING. THAT ALL MAKES THE THREE COUNTIES CENTRE A GOOD CHOICE FOR GLOUCESTERSHIRE BUSINESSES LOOKING FOR A DISTINCTIVE, NEARBY VENUE TO STAGE EVENTS. ONE, STAVERTON-BASED CREED FOODSERVICE, HAS SELECTED IT FOR ITS CREED FOODSERVICE TRADE SHOW. ONE OF THE ATTRACTIONS OF THE SHOWGROUND FOR CREED WAS ITS HISTORY IN AGRICULTURE AND FOOD BUT, IN THE WORDS OF CREED FOODSERVICE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, CHRIS CREED: "IT'S NOT THAT FAR". "THIS IS A REALLY SPECIAL SPACE AND WHILST WE ARE LOCATED IN AN AREA OF OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY, SOME SERIOUS BUSINESS IS DONE HERE. "PERHAPS, HOWEVER, SOME PEOPLE DO NOT REALISE THE EXTENT OF OUR FACILITIES AND THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE FOR HIRE YEAR ROUND. "WE WOULD WELCOME YOU TO GET IN TOUCH AND COME FOR A TOUR." KEN NOTTAGE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, THREE COUNTIES AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY "WE CHOSE THE THREE COUNTIES FOR THE CREED ANNUAL TRADE SHOW 2015 BECAUSE THE FACILITIES WERE JUST WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF EXHIBITION SPACE, AVAILABILITY OF AN INDUSTRIAL KITCHEN AND EASE OF ACCESS. "THE THREE COUNTIES TEAM HAVE BEEN FRIENDLY AND PROFESSIONAL AND ALL IN ALL IT'S A GREAT SETTING". CHRIS CREED, CEO, CREED FOODSERVICE "I'VE BEEN TO A NUMBER OF EVENTS AT THREE COUNTIES AND WAS A SPEAKER AT THE THREE COUNTIES BIG BREAKFAST, WHICH WAS PACKED WITH LOCAL BUSINESS PEOPLE. "IT'S A VERSATILE VENUE THAT IS WITHIN EASY STRIKING DISTANCE OF CHELTENHAM AND, OF COURSE, THE SETTING WITH THE VIEWS OF THE MALVERN HILLS IS UNPARALLELED."

48	BRADLEY A. AREHEART (UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF LAW) HAS POSTED ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY (ALABAMA LAW REVIEW, FORTHCOMING 2016) ON SSRN. HERE IS THE ABSTRACT: COURTS HAVE INTERPRETED THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA) AND THE PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION ACT (PDA) NOT TO AFFIRMATIVELY REQUIRE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PREGNANT WORKERS. THIS HAS GENERATED PROTEST AND LED ALL THREE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PREGNANCY RIGHTS. THE PREGNANT WORKERS FAIRNESS ACT IS PENDING IN CONGRESS AND HAS DRAWN STRONG VOCAL SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT RECENTLY DECIDED YOUNG V. UPS, WHICH FOUND THE PDA DOES NOT AFFIRMATIVELY REQUIRE PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS. FINALLY, MANY COMMENTATORS HAVE ARGUED IN SUPPORT OF CONSIDERING PREGNANCY A DISABILITY UNDER THE ADA.  IN CONTRAST TO THOSE WHO FAVOR A PREGNANCY-SPECIFIC RIGHT TO ACCOMMODATIONS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH PROPOSALS CREATE RISKS TO WOMENS LONG-TERM EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE.  CURRENTLY PROPOSED MEASURES MAY REVITALIZE EXCLUSIONARY AND PATERNALISTIC ATTITUDES TOWARD PREGNANT EMRPLOYEES, SIGNAL INCAPACITY TO WORK, OR ACTUALLY INCREASE SEX DISCRIMINATION.  QUESTION 4: ARE YOU INTERESTED IN HOMEMADE FLOURS AND NUT BUTTERS? WE SHOULD THUS CONSICDER THE POTENTIAL EXPRESSIVE IMPACT OF PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATION SCHEMES IN LIGHT OF CURRENT SOCIAL NORMS IN WHICH PREGNANT WOMEN ARE GENERALLY SEEN AS CAPABLE OF PRODUCTIVE WORK.  ON HIS PART, OTIOTIO SAID HIS DECISION TO JOIN THE RACE WAS TAKEN BECAUSE HE WAS PREPARED FOR THE JOB AND THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE DESERVE A LEADER LIKE HIM WHO WILL BRING TO BEAR INTEGRITY IN RUNNING THE AFFAIRS OF THE STATE. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO SECURING PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS THAT WOULD AVOID EXPRESSIVE HARMS AND EMPLOY A GENDER SYMMETRICAL APPROACH.  FOR THOSE WJHO STUDY CIVIL RIGHTS, ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY ILLUSTRATES THE EXPRESSIVE PERILS OF RIGHTS CLAIMING. FOOR HISTORIANS AND SCHOLARS INTERESTED IN GENDER ISSUES, THIS ARTICFLEZ PROVIDES A CHANCE TO RECONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF GENDER-ASYMMETRICAL LAWS. FOR FAMILY LAW SCHOLARS, ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY HIGHLIGHTS THE CURRENT CAPACITY OF THE LAW TO RESHAPE WORK/FAMILY BALANCE. TO ASSUME THAT IMPLEMENTING GENDER-ASYMMETRICAL RIGHTS IS THE BEST WAY TO HELP WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE OVERLOOKS THE POTENTIAL OF THE LAW TO AMELIORATE BROADER SOCIAL ISSUES. THESE INCLUDE THE WAY IN WHICH EMPLOYMENT IS TYPICALLY STRUCTURED TO ACCOMMODATE THE MOST PRIVILEGED EMPLOYEES AND HOW EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE ACCOMMODATING WORKPLACES.

50	THE CURRENT WAVE OF MIGRANTS FLOODING INTO EUROPE IS THE WORST SINCE WORLD WAR II. THE TRENDS RESEARCH INSTITUTE FORECASTS THAT MIGRANT CRISIS WILL DRAMATICALLY ESCALATE. BOTH THE CAUSE AND EFFECTS ARE TREND LINES LEADING TO A HUMANITARIAN CALAMITY, SOCIAL UNREST AND GEOPOLITICAL CONFLICT THAT WILL DESTABILIZE GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE. FOR SOME TWO YEARS, SHIPLOADS OF DESPERATE REFUGEES ATTEMPTING TO REACH EUROPE HAVE BEEN DROWNING WHILE BRUSSELS BICKERED OVER HOW TO HANDLE THE HUMAN TIDE WASHING UP ON THEIR SHORES. IN VIRTUALLY ALL MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE MIGRANT CRISIS WHICH HAD BEGUN ITS ASCENT IN 2012 AND HAS NOW DRAMATICALLY ESCALATED THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO SPECIFICS EXPLAINING WHY CONDITIONS HAVE DETERIORATED SO BADLY THAT HOPELESS MILLIONS RISK THEIR LIVES TO FLEE THEIR HOMELAND. INDEED, AS EVIDENCED BY MONDAYS FRONT PAGE NEW YORK TIMES HEADLINE (AND SIMILARLY REPEATED IN WESTERN MEDIA), THE OFT-CITED QUESTION IS, AS EUROPE GRASPS FOR ANSWERS, MORE MIGRANTS FLOOD ITS BORDERS. THE ANSWERS SOUGHT ARE HOW DO DEAL WITH THE REFUGEE TIDE. THE QUESTION BARELY BROACHED IS WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE CATASTROPHE? WHAT HAS FINALLY PUT THE MIGRANT CRISIS INTO MAINSTREAM FOCUS WAS THE HEART-WRENCHING PHOTO OF A DEAD SYRIAN BABY BOY LYING FACE DOWN ON A BEACH IN TURKEY. PRIOR TO THE 2011 ARAB SPRING THAT SWEPT MUCH OF THE MIDDLE EAST, SYRIA WAS A RELATIVELY PEACEFUL NATION. HOWEVER, AFTER THE UNITED STATES, ITS WESTERN EUROPEAN ALLIES AND THE ARAB LEAGUE DEMANDED REGIME CHANGE AND SUPPORTED REBEL FACTIONS TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT, A BLOODY CIVIL WAR ENSUED THAT HAS DESTROYED THE ONCE PROSPEROUS NATION, LEAVING SOME 300,000 DEAD, 11 MILLION DISPLACED AND 4 MILLION MIGRANTS SEEKING SAFE HAVEN.BUT SYRIA IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY WAR-TORN NATIONS FROM WHICH COUNTLESS MILLIONS ARE FLEEING. AS WE WROTE SOME TWO MONTHS AGO IN THE SUMMER TRENDS JOURNAL: THE GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS OF MORE WAR ARE NOT ONLY COSTLY REGARDING MASS DESTRUCTION AND LIVES AND MONEY LOST. THE DESTABILIZATION THROUGHOUT AFRICA AND WARS WAGED BY THE US AND ITS COALITION THAT HAVE DESTROYED IRAQ, LIBYA, AFGHANISTAN, YEMEN AND SYRIA HAVE CREATED A MIGRATION SURGE INTO EUROPE THAT WILL PROVE THE GREATEST IN WORLD HISTORY. FROM SOMALIA, SUDAN, NIGERIA, MALI, ERITREA, BURUNDI, IVORY COAST CIVIL WARS, CROSS-BORDER WARS, INSURGENCIES AND UPRISINGS ARE TEARING APART NATIONS AND FORCING MILLIONS TO FLEE FOR THEIR LIVES. AND BEYOND THE HUMAN INSTINCT TO FIGHT TO SURVIVE, ARE THE EVERYDAYECONOMIC REALITIES. AROUND THE WORLD EMERGING MARKETS THAT WERE ONCE BOOMING WHEN COMMODITY PRICES WERE HITTING NEW HIGHS ARE NOW, ALONG WITH THEIR CURRENCIES, CRASHING AS COMMODITY PRICES SINK TO 16-YEAR LOWS. FROM GHANA TO VENEZUELA, FROM INDONESIA TO BRAZIL, MANY MILLIONS MORE WILL BE ESCAPING POVERTY SEARCHING THE GLOBE TO EARN A LIVING. TREND FORECAST: WITH ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED NATIONS BARELY ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN, WHETHER MIGRATION INTO EUROPE OR IMMIGRATION INTO THE US, A NOT WELCOME HERE TREND WILL NOT ONLY BECOME A HOT-BUTTON POLITICAL ISSUE THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE WORLD, IT WILL DETERMINE ELECTION OUTCOMES.

52	UPDATED. EVEN THOUGH FASHION DESIGNERS WILL STILL MOCK ONLY AFTER THEY PUT HER IN THE FIRST ROW AT THEIR SHOWS), EVERYTHING SHE WEARS WILL STILL BECOME A TREND BECAUSE ITS ON HER AND SHE HAS MILLIONS OF ADORING FANS, DYING TO REPLICATE HE TRULY IS THE FASHION GENIUS HE THINKS HE IS KANYE WESTS SECOND COLLECTION FOR ADIDAS, WHICH DEBUTED AT THE NEW YORK FASHION WEEK 2015, WAS MET WIDELY WITH RIDICULE, BUT HE STILL THINKS HES A FASHION GENIUS. UNSURPRISINGLY, HIS WIFE KIM KARDASHIAN WEST IS OF THE SAME OPINION: HE IS A FASHION GENIUS BECAUSE HE IS THE ONE WHO TURNED HER INTO A FASHION ICON. THE LATEST VIDEO FROM CNN STYLE (SEE BELOW) FOCUSES ON KIMS RISE FROM DERIDED REALITY STAR TO THE STATUS OF CELEBRITY ALL DESIGNERS WANT TO PUT IN THE FIRST ROW AT THEIR SHOWS. WHILE THE VIDEO UNDERLINES THAT KIMS INCLUSION IN THE HIGH FASHION WORLD WAS INEVITABLE BECAUSE DESIGNERS HAD STARTED UNDERSTANDING HER POPULARITY (WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH FASHION), SHE LIKES TO BECAUSE OF KANYE. KANYE CHANGED EVERYTHING SHORTLY AFTER KIM AND KANYE WENT PUBLIC WITH THEIR ROMANCE, HIS FIRST KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS AIRED: IT SHOWED HIM GOING THROUGH HER WARDROBE AND TELLING HER THAT HE WOULD BE DRESSING HER FROM THEN ON. SINCE THEN, KANYE HAS BEEN KIMS STYLIST, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER FIRST SHE SAYS SHE HAD 5 DIFFERENT STYLISTS.  TODAY, KIM KARDASHIAN IS WIDELY CONSIDERED A FASHION ICON, EVEN THOUGH MOST OF HER OUTFITS STILL PROVIDE CELEBRITY BLOGGERS WITH THE BEST JOKE MATERIAL POSSIBLE.  I MEAN, BACK IN THE DAY I THOUGHT I HAD THE BEST STYLE. I LOOK BACK AT OUTFITS AND I'M, LIKE, MORTIFIED. KANYE SEES WHATS OUT THERE ON THE STREETS AND JUST KNOWS HOW TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO SOMETHING THAT WOULD LOOK GOOD ON ME. JUST HELPING ME PUSH MY LIMITS A LITTLE BIT AND TRYING NEW THNGS. KANYE DID MANAGE TO TURN KIM INTO AN ICON KANYE IS ALSO THE FIRST TO STATE OUT LOUD THAT KIM WAS AN ICON, THE MARILYN MONROE OF OUR TIMES, THE MOST GORGEOUS, CLASSY AND STYLISH WOMAN IN THE WORLD.  SHE IS SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT: SHE IS POPULAR, AND IN TODAYS WORLD, POPULARITY MEANS EVERYTHING.
53	[CAPTION ID="ATTACHMENT_5828" ALIGN="ALIGNCENTER" WIDTH="660"] THAT'S ME STANDING OVER TO THE RIGHT. IMAGE COURTESY OF ROCKY SUNICO.[/CAPTION] LAST WEEKEND WAS WHEN ME AND A FEW OTHER VOLUNTEER GMS KICKED OFF OUR BIGGEST ATTEMPT AT A LOCAL MINI-CONVENTION FOR TABLETOP ROLEPLAYING GAMES IN MANILA. WE TRY TO RUN AN EVENT EVERY MONTH, AND LAST MONTH WAS OUR MOST AMBITIOUS EVENT IN THE FORM OF THE AUGUST D&D MINI-CONVENTION. WHILE THE STORY BEHIND THE CONVENTIONS AND HOW IT TURNED OUT IS PRETTY COOL, I'LL SEE IF I CAN DEDICATE ANOTHER BLOG POST TO TALK ABOUT THAT. TODAY I WANTED TO SHARE A LITTLE ABOUT THE GAME I RAN FOR THE CONVENTION, WHICH I CALLED "DUNGEON DELVERZ EXTREME!" UM, WHAT? EXACTLY. HERE'S THE PITCH I GAVE: IN THE NEAR FUTURE, THE MOST POPULAR SPECTATOR SPORT TO GRACE THE HOLO-SCREENS OF EVERY HOUSEHOLD IS NONE OTHER THAN DUNGEON DELVERS EXTREME! CYBER ATHLETES FROM AROUND THE WORLD COMPETE IN VIRTUAL REALITY DUNGEON CRAWLS AGAINST OTHER TEAMS, ENGAGING IN BLOODY SPECTACLES OF MIGHT AND SORCERY. YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE MADE IT AS FAR AS THE QUALIFIERS, AND THIS MATCH COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MOVING ON TO THE FINALS OR GOING HOME AS LOSERS. WHICH WILL YOU BE TONIGHT? AS YOU CAN TELL, THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF RECURSION HERE, WITH PLAYERS TAKING THE ROLE OF ATHLETES, WHO BASICALLY TAKE ON THE ROLE OF THEIR VIRTUAL REALITY AVATARS. I HAD INITIALLY OPENED THE GAME UP FOR 4 PLAYERS, BUT BY THE TIME THE CONVENTION ROLLED AROUND, I HAD 7. GIVEN THAT IT WAS MEANT TO SIMULATE A HOLO-VID REALITY SHOW, THE EXPERIENCE WOULDN'T BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A BIT OF AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. SO I FIGURED IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A LIVE AUDIENCE. AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION TO GET THE AUDIENCE MORE INVOLVED, I ALSO ADDED A SMALL RULE TO THE GAME. ONCE PER ENCOUNTER, A MEMBER OF THE AUDIENCE MAY REQUEST FOR A SPECIFIC ACTION TO BE TAKEN BY THE PARTY. IF A PLAYER CHARACTER IS ABLE TO EXECUTE THE ACTION SUCCESSFULLY DURING THE ENCOUNTER, THEY GAIN A FAVOR TOKEN. ON THEIR TURN, A PLAYER MAY SPEND A FAVOR TOKEN TO GAIN ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: REROLL A FAILED CHECK OR SAVE STABILIZE AND RESTORE TO 1 HP HEAL 1 HIT DIE WORTH OF DAMAGE THIS LET THE AUDIENCE THROW IN SOME INTERESTING CURVEBALLS TOWARDS THE PLAYERS IN EACH ENCOUNTER. THIS RANGED FROM RANDOM PRODUCT PLUGS "QUICK DO AN IN-CHARACTER TESTIMONIAL OF HOW AWESOME THIS HAND SANTIZIER IS!" TO SPECIFIC ACTIONS, "TAKE THE LIZARDMAN'S HEAD OFF!" AND EVEN A FEW OF THE MORE BIZARRE ONES LIKE, "SEDUCE THE DRAGON!" THAT SAID, DESPITE LOSING MY VOICE TOWARDS THE LAST ENCOUNTER, THE TEAM HAD A GREAT TIME, AND THE AUDIENCE WAS GETTING WAY INTO IT, THINKING OF MORE CRAZY IDEAS OF WHAT TO GET THE PLAYERS TO DO TO EARN THOSE FAVOR TOKENS.
54	THE ONAMIA PANTHERS VOLLEYBALL TEAM TURNED IN A SOLID 12-DAY RUN DURING MID-SEPTEMBER, WINNING THE CROSBY-IRONTON TOURNAMENT WITH A 3-1 RECORD, BEATING GREAT RIVER CONFERENCE TEAMS ISLE AND HINCKLEY/FINLAYSON AND LOSING TO PINE CITY. COUNTING TOURNAMENT PLAY, THE PANTHERS ENTER OCTOBER WITH AN OVERALL RECORD OF 10-7 AND 3-3 IN THE CONFERENCE WORTH FOUR POINTS. CROSBY-IRONTON TOURNAMENT AFTER DROPPING THE FIRST MATCH 2-1 TO PINE RIVER/BACKUS, THE ONAMIA PANTHERS WON THREE IN A ROW BEATING EVELETH-GILBERT 2-0, CASS LAKE-BENA 2-1 AND MARANATHA CHRISTIAN 2-0, EARNING THEM THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE ANNUAL CROSBY-IRONTON VOLLEYBALL TOURNAMENT ON SATURDAY, SEPT. 19.

DESPITE THREE STRAIGHT ACES OFF THE SERVICE OF HANNAH TOWNE THAT BROUGHT THE HUSKIES TO WITHIN FIVE POINTS OF THE LEAD DURING THE FIRST GAME, THE PANTHERS WENT ON TO OUTSCORE THEIR GUESTS 9-3 DOWN THE STRETCH TO WIN, 25-14. BOTH SENIOR KAYLAS NYSTEDT FROM ONAMIA AND LARSON FROM ISLE TRADED POWER KILLS DURING THE EARLY GOING OF GAME TWO, AND ISLE TOOK THEIR FIRST LEAD OF THE NIGHT AT 12-11, BEFORE THREE SERVES INTO THE NET BY THE HUSKIES GAVE THE PANTHERS THE SIDE OUTS NEEDED TO POLISH OFF THE 25-19 WIN. DOWN 3-1 IN GAME THREE, ONAMIA WENT ON TO SCORE 15 UNANSWERED POINTS OFF THE SERVE OF SAM, WHOSE LOW-TRAJECTORY BULLETS PRODUCED EIGHT ACES DURING THAT STRETCH. ONAMIA WON THAT SET, 25-10. NYSTEDT FINISHED THE MATCH WITH 17 KILLS, AND SAM HAD SEVEN. FROM THE SERVICE LINE, SAM HAD EIGHT ACES WHILE MAKING GOOD ON 22 OF 25 ATTEMPTS. KAYLA LARSON HAD NINE KILLS TO LEAD THE HUSKIES ON OFFENSE.

THE PANTHERS SPOTTED THE JAGS A 4-1 LEAD IN GAME ONE, BEFORE RUNNING OFF EIGHT STRAIGHT POINTS OFF THE SERVE OF MADISON HUSOM. FIVE ACES, ALONG WITH POWER KILLS FROM KAYLA NYSTEDT, ARIANNA SAM AND SYDNEY FORBORD, HELPED THE CAUSE ON OFFENSE FOR THE PANTHERS IN WINNING GAME ONE, 25-17. NYSTEDT AND SAM CONTINUED THEIR ONSLAUGHT AT THE NET FOR ONAMIA IN GAME TWO, COMBINING FOR NINE KILLS. THE PANTHERS GOT 12 KILLS IN GAME THREES WIN, INCLUDING FOUR FROM NYSTEDT, THREE EACH FROM MORGAN BALDER AND SAM, AND ONE APIECE FROM FORBORD AND ANGEL POTTER ON THE WAY TO A 25-10 ROMP. ONAMIA SERVERS HAILEY TIHLARIK AND HUSOM COMBINED FOR EIGHT ACES FOR THE MATCH. NYSTEDT, SAM AND ANGEL POTTER HAD 19 KILLS BETWEEN THEM. HINCKLEY/FIN 17 18 10 ONAMIA 25 25 25 PINE CITY THE PINE CITY DRAGONS ARE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE TOP FOUR TEAMS IN THE GREAT RIVER CONFERENCE THIS FALL, AND THEY PROVED THEIR STATUS BY BEATING A GOOD ONAMIA TEAM IN THREE STRAIGHT SETS ON SEPT. 24. COMMENTING ON HER TEAMS LOSS, ONAMIA COACH LINDA CARON SAID, THEIR BACKCOURT WAS AMAZING. I CANT RECALL THEM MISSING A SERVICE ALL NIGHT. AS FOR THE PANTHERS. THEY SPOTTED THE DRAGONS A 5-0 LEAD IN GAME ONE AND HANDED THEIR HOSTS FIVE FREE POINTS WITH NET SERVES, BUT STILL WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE GAME INTO SUDDEN DEATH BEFORE LOSING, 30-28. GAME TWO WAS ALSO CLOSE, BUT WON BY THE DRAGONS. ONAMIAS TOP HITTER, KAYLA NYSTEDT, FINISHED THE MATCH WITH 19 KILLS, FOLLOWED BY EIGHT FROM ARIANNA SAM.

55	RUSSIA WILL DELIVER ITS CUTTING-EDGE LONG-RANGE ANTI-TANK GUIDED MISSILE SYSTEMS TO FOREIGN ARMS CUSTOMERS. THE KREMLIN HAS REACHED A NUMBER OF CONTRACTS TO SELL THE KORNET-EM LONG-RANGE ANTI-TANK GUIDED MISSILE SYSTEMS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES, ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER OF THE MISSILE SYSTEM. IMAGE SOURCE: VITALY V. KUZMIN THE AGREEMENTS ON DELIVERY OF KORNET-EM [MISSILE] COMPLEX TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN ALREADY CONCLUDED, AN OFFICIAL FROM THE INSTRUMENT DESIGN BUREAU (KBP) TOLD RIA NOVOSTI DURING THE RAE-2015 MILITARY EXHIBITION ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER, THE OFFICIAL DID NOT SHED ANY LIGHT AS TO WHICH COUNTRIES RUSSIA REACHED AGREEMENTS WITH. THE KORNET-EM MISSILES WITH SHAPED-CHARGE WARHEADS HAVE A RANGE OF ABOUT 5 MILES, AND MISSILES WITH HIGH-EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF A RANGE OF ABOUT 6.2 MILES, AS DESCRIBED BY THE OFFICIAL. THE KORNET SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF FIRING TWO MISSILES SIMULTANEOUSLY AT ONE TARGET FOR HIGH ELIMINATION PROBABILITY. MEANWHILE, THE MISSILE WITH A HIGH-EXPLOSIVE WARHEAD CAN ELIMINATE AIRCRAFT TARGETS SUCH AS HELICOPTER AND DRONES. THE MUCH DESIRED BY FOREIGN CUSTOMERS MISSILE SYSTEM WAS SHOWCASED AT THE MAKS AIRSHOW IN AUGUST 2011. THE MAKS 2015 AIRSHOW INCLUDED SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, DRONES, HELICOPTERS AND OTHER BRAND NEW AIRCRAFT, WHICH KEPT RUSSIAN MILITARY MINDS OCCUPIED FOR SEVERAL YEARS IF NOT DECADES. THE COMPANY (KBP) IS A KEY RUSSIAN MANUFACTURER OF HIGH-PRECISION WEAPONS, GRENADE LAUNCHERS AS WELL AS MODERN AIRCRAFT GUNS. U.S. SANCTIONS DID NOTHING TO RUSSIAS ARMS EXPORTS ROSOBORONEXPORT, AN INTERMEDIARY AGENCY FOR RUSSIAS EXPORTS/IMPORTS OF ARMS, HAS STATED THAT U.S. SANCTIONS HAVE NOT AFFECTED ARMS EXPORT OF RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTINS COUNTRY. WE HAVE NO DOUBTS OF FULFILLING THE PLAN FOR THIS YEAR, DEPUTY CEO OF ROSOBORONEXPORT SERGEI GORESLAVSKIY TOLD RUSSIAN STATE-OWNED ITAR-TASS . HE ADDED THAT WESTERN SANCTIONS HAVE NOT AFFECTED RUSSIAS ARMS EXPORT. IT WAS EARLIER REPORTED THAT THE COMPANY IS PLANNING TO DELIVER ABROAD MILITARY WEAPONRY AND HARDWARE FOR THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF AT LEAST $13 BILLION. OVER THE PAST YEAR, BACK WHEN WESTERN SANCTIONS DID NOT TARGET RUSSIAS ARMS MANUFACTURING AND EXPORTING FIRMS, ROSOBORONEXPORT EXPORTED ARMS FOR THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF $13.2 BILLION. RUSSIA IS ALSO RECEIVING MORE OFFERS FROM FOREIGN PARTNERS IN LEASING RUSSIAN MILITARY HARDWARE, ACCORDING TO GORESLAVSKIY. IN COLLABORATION WITH NEW DELHI, MOSCOW IS DEVELOPING RUSSIAN HELICOPTER KA-226T IN INDIA. THIS MODEL OF THE HELICOPTER CAN BE USED DURING RESCUE OPERATIONS IN INACCESSIBLE HIGH-MOUNTAIN AREAS OF INDIA. RUSSIA IS PUSHING ITS HARDWARE TO INTERNATIONAL MARKET OVER 15 YEARS SINCE ROSOBORONEXPORT WAS FOUNDED, THE VOLUME OF EXPORTS OF ARMS FOR GROUND FORCES HAS INCREASED BY TEN TIMES. WE CONFIDENTLY COMPETE WITH LEADING DEVELOPERS AND CAN OFFER THE MARKET OUR COMPLEX, ALL-INCLUSIVE SOLUTIONS IN THE FIELD OF NATIONAL SECURITY, GORESLAVSKIY NOTED. ACCORDING TO HIM, THE COMPANY IS PUSHING OVER 700 UNITS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. THE MAJOR CONTRACTS FOR ARMS DEVELOPED BY RUSSIA INCLUDE: THE DELIVERY OF T-90C TANKS TO INDIA AND AZERBAIJAN, THE BMP-3 FIGHTING VEHICLE TO AZERBAIJAN AND INDONESIA, SELF-PROPELLED ARTILLERY AND HEAVY FLAME-THROWING SYSTEMS TO IRAQ AND AZERBAIJAN, WEAPON SUPPLIES TO INDIA AND UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, ENGINEER EQUIPMENT TO IRAQ AS WELL AS ANTI-TANK COMPLEXES TO BAHREIN AND NAMIBIA. ALSO, RUSSIA IS WORKING ON MODERNIZING A NUMBER OF PREVIOUSLY DELIVERED HARDWARE, INCLUDING THE ONES IT DELIVERED TO ALGERIA. THE 10TH RUSSIA ARMS EXPO RAE-2015 INTERNATIONAL ARMS SHOW OPENED IN THE URAL CITY OF NIZHNY TAGIL ON SEPTEMBER 9 AND WILL RUN THROUGH SEPTEMBER 12. THE MOST PROMINENT SHOWCASES TOOK PLACE ON AN OPEN TRAINING RANGE OF OVER 400,000 SQUARE METERS, WHICH ALLOWED RUSSIAN MILITARIES TO SHOW OFF COMBAT AND OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MILITARY HARDWARE IN REAL TIME. RUSSIA ARMS EXPO RAE-2015 ORGANIZERS EARLIER SAID THAT THE SHOW WOULD BE ATTENDED BY AT LEAST 65 FOREIGN DELEGATIONS. THE SHOW ALSO INCLUDES BRAND NEW RUSSIAN ARMORED VEHICLE MODELS SUCH AS THE T-14 ARMATA MAIN BATTLE TANK AND HEAVY BMP T-15 ON THE ARMATA PLATFORM. LEAKED DETAILS OF RUSSIAS MILITARY DELIVERIES TO SYRIA DETAILS OF THE DELIVERIES OF RUSSIAN ARMS TO THE BASHAR AL-ASSAD REGIME IN SYRIA HAVE SURFACED IN THE RUSSIAN MEDIA. RUSSIA HAS CONFIRMED PROVIDING MILITARY AID TO SYRIA AND THE PRESENCE OF ITS MILITARY EXPERTS IN THE COUNTRY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN KOMMERSANT NEWSPAPER . AS OF TODAY, RUSSIA IS HOLDING TALKS WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO REACH AGREEMENTS ON THE DELIVERY OF A FEW BATCHES OF SMALL ARMS, GRENADE LAUNCHERS, THE BTR-82A ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS, THE URAL MILITARY VEHICLES AS WELL AS OTHER WEAPONRY NEEDED FOR LOCAL MILITARY ACTIONS AND DEPLOYING THE SYRIAN ARMY TO DIFFERENT SPOTS OF THE COUNTRY, ACCORDING TO SOURCES CITED BY KOMMERSANT. FOR MONTHS, THE KREMLIN HAS BEEN PUSHING FORWARD THE IDEA TO INCLUDE THE SYRIAN ARMY INTO THE U.S.-LED ANTI-TERRORIST COALITION. WASHINGTON CONSIDERS ANY MILITARY AID FROM RUSSIA TO THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT UNACCEPTABLE, ACCORDING TO THE SPOKESMAN FOR U.S. EMBASSY TO RUSSIA, WILLIAM STEVENS. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE TO PROVIDE THE ASSAD REGIME WITH ANY SUPPORT, AS IT ALLOWS ASSAD TO AVOID FINDING THE SOLUTION TO END THE CONFLICT, STEVENS SAID. HE ADDED THAT INSTEAD OF HELPING SYRIAN PEOPLE TO JOIN THE FIGHT AGAINST EXTREMISM AND ISIS, RUSSIA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE REGIME THAT GIVES THE GROWTH TO EXTREMISM IN THE REGION. WHEN ASKED BY KOMMERSANT NEWSPAPER WHY THE WEST DOES NOT WANT TO JOIN ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT, STEVENS SAID THAT WE ARE ALREADY WAGING A WAR AGAINST ISIS WITH 60 FOREIGN COALITION PARTNERS. HE ADDED THAT THE ASSAD REGIME CANT BE A U.S. ALLY IN THIS WAR. BIPOLAR WORLD WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA ON ONE SIDE VALUEWALK EARLIER REPORTED THAT MOSCOW HAS PLANS TO TAKE OVER THE MIDDLE EAST WITH ITS ARMS. THE KREMLIN IS CURRENTLY INTERESTED IN REACHING MILITARY CONTRACTS WITH EGYPT, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN AND PAKISTAN. SAUDI ARABIA IS REPORTEDLY PLANNING TO PURCHASE RUSSIAN WEAPONS TO REPLACE U.S. WEAPONS IN THE COUNTRY, WHILE IRAN IS WAITING FOR RUSSIAS DELIVERY OF THE S-300 ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEMS BY THE END OF 2015. PAKISTAN, A TRADITIONAL RIVAL OF RUSSIA, IS PURCHASING RUSSIAS MI-35 COMBAT HELICOPTERS ALONG WITH THE KLIMOV RD-93 ENGINES FOR ITS JF-17 MULTI-ROLE FIGHTERS. ITS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PAKISTAN REQUIRES CHINAS ENGINEERS AND HELP IN CO-PRODUCTION AND CO-DEVELOPMENT OF JF-17 FIGHTER JETS. GIVEN THE WARMING RELATIONS BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND RUSSIA, THERE ARE INDICATIONS OF THE EMERGENCE OF THE WORLDS NEW SUPERPOWER AXIS BETWEEN RUSSIA, PAKISTAN AND CHINA , WHICH WORRIES WASHINGTON. IF SUCH A TRIANGLE IS CREATED, IT WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO A BIPOLAR WORLD WITH CHINA, RUSSIA, PAKISTAN AND A NUMBER OF OTHER AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL ASIA ON ONE SIDE, AND THE U.S., EU, JAPAN AND THEIR ASIAN ALLIES ON THE OTHER SIDE.

58	THREE CLIENTS FROM THE DAN SMITH HOME IN MONROE HAVE A NEW VEGETABLE GARDEN, COURTESY OF A VOLUNTEER TEAM FROM BIGELOW TEA. THIS CHARITABLE PROJECT IS PART OF THE KENNEDY CENTERS ADOPT-A-HOME PROGRAM. VOLUNTEERING CAN BE FUN. BUT ITS EVEN BETTER IF YOU CAN ENJOY THE GREAT OUTDOORS AND CREATE SOMETHING NEW. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SIX MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM FROM BIGELOW TEA IN FAIRFIELD DID TO HELP OUT KENNEDY CENTER CLIENTS. THEY SPENT HALF THE DAY BUILDING AND PLANTING A RAISED VEGETABLE GARDEN AT THE DAN SMITH GROUP HOME IN MONROE. THIS CHARITABLE PROJECT IS PART OF THE KENNEDY CENTERS ADOPT-A-HOME PROGRAM, WHICH UNITES A GROUP HOME WITH BUSINESSES, CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN NEW HAVEN AND FAIRFIELD COUNTIES. BIGELOW TEA WAS THE FIRST COMPANY TO VOLUNTEER WITH THE KENNEDY CENTER ON THIS INITIATIVE AND HAS PREVIOUSLY WORKED ON OTHER AREA GROUPS HOMES. IN ADDITION TO SUPPLYING THE MANPOWER, BIGELOW TEA PURCHASED ALL THE SUPPLIES, INCLUDING THE PLANTS, SOIL, WOOD BOXES AND FENCING. THE KENNEDY CENTER CLIENTS SAY THEY ARE ENJOYING THE FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR AND HAVE FRESH HERBS, CABBAGE, SQUASH AND TOMATOES TO USE IN THEIR SALADS. ACCORDING TO MARTIN D. SCHWARTZ, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE KENNEDY CENTER, BIGELOW TEA HAS BEEN SUCH A WONDERFUL PARTNER TO THE KENNEDY CENTER OVER THE YEARS. THEY HAVE TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE TO OUR AGENCY AND THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. THE KENNEDY CENTER, FOUNDED IN 1951, IS AN INTERNATIONALLY ACCREDITED, NON-PROFIT, COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION ORGANIZATION THAT CURRENTLY SERVES 2,400 INDIVIDUALS ANNUALLY. THE AGENCY ACTIVELY RESPONDS TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY BY OFFERING INNOVATIVE, COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE OPTIONS TO PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND SPECIAL NEEDS, FROM BIRTH TO SENIOR YEARS. THE KENNEDY CENTER OPERATES 29 COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE PROGRAMS, 16 GROUP HOMES, AN INDUSTRIES PROGRAM COMPOSED OF SIX BUSINESSES, SUPPORTED AND COMPETITIVE EMPLOYMENT AND JOB PLACEMENT SERVICES, A FAMILY SUPPORT AND RESPITE SERVICE, TRAVEL TRAINING AND A VARIETY OF CHILDRENS PROGRAMS.

59	U.S. SPACE AGENCY NASA ANNOUNCED ON MONDAY IT HAS FOUND "STRONG" EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS LIQUID WATER INTERMITTENTLY FLOWING ON PRESENT-DAY MARS. IMAGES TAKEN FROM THE MARS ORBIT SHOWED DARK, FINGER-LIKE MARKINGS THAT, TYPICALLY LESS THAN FIVE METERS IN WIDTH, APPEAR ON SLOPES DURING WARM SEASONS, LENGTHEN AND THEN FADE DURING COOLER SEASONS ON THE RED PLANET. THESE SURFACE FEATURES, KNOWN AS RECURRING SLOPE LINEAE (RSL), HAVE BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO FORM BY THE ACTIVITY OF BRINES, BUT DIRECT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN LACKING. NOW, USING AN IMAGING SPECTROMETER FROM NASA'S MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO), RESEARCHERS DETECTED SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED MINERALS ON SLOPES WHERE THE MYSTERIOUS STREAKS ARE SEEN ON MARS. "OUR QUEST ON MARS HAS BEEN TO 'FOLLOW THE WATER,' IN OUR SEARCH FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, AND NOW WE HAVE CONVINCING SCIENCE THAT VALIDATES WHAT WE'VE LONG SUSPECTED," SAID JOHN GRUNSFELD, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR OF NASA'S SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE IN WASHINGTON. "THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT, AS IT APPEARS TO CONFIRM THAT WATER -- ALBEIT BRINY -- IS FLOWING TODAY ON THE SURFACE OF MARS." THESE PUZZLING SURFACE FEATURES WERE FIRST NOTICED IN 2010 BY LUJENDRA OJHA, THEN A UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT, USING IMAGES FROM THE MRO'S HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING SCIENCE EXPERIMENT. IN THE NEW STUDY, OJHA, NOW A GRADUATE STUDENT AT GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, AND HIS COLLEAGUES ANALYZED SPECTRA DATA FROM THE COMPACT RECONNAISSANCE IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM) ABOARD THE MRO FROM FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHERE THE RSL FEATURES WERE PRESENT. THEY REPORTED IN THE BRITISH JOURNAL NATURE GEOSCIENCE THAT SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED SALTS AT THESE RSL LOCATIONS EXISTED ONLY WHEN THE DARK FEATURES WERE RELATIVELY WIDE. "WE FOUND THE HYDRATED SALTS ONLY WHEN THE SEASONAL FEATURES WERE WIDEST, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT EITHER THE DARK STREAKS THEMSELVES OR A PROCESS THAT FORMS THEM IS THE SOURCE OF THE HYDRATION," OJHA SAID. "IN EITHER CASE, THE DETECTION OF HYDRATED SALTS ON THESE SLOPES MEANS THAT WATER PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THESE STREAKS." THE RESEARCHERS INTERPRETED THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES AS CAUSED BY HYDRATED MINERALS CALLED PERCHLORATES, WHICH ARE LIKELY A MIXTURE OF MAGNESIUM PERCHLORATE, MAGNESIUM CHLORATE AND SODIUM PERCHLORATE. SOME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO KEEP LIQUIDS FROM FREEZING EVEN WHEN CONDITIONS ARE AS COLD AS MINUS 94 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT (MINUS 70 CELSIUS), NASA SAID. ON EARTH, NATURALLY PRODUCED PERCHLORATES ARE CONCENTRATED IN DESERTS, AND SOME TYPES OF PERCHLORATES CAN BE USED AS ROCKET PROPELLANT. PERCHLORATES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN ON MARS. FOR EXAMPLE, NASA'S PHOENIX LANDER AND CURIOSITY ROVER BOTH FOUND THEM IN THE PLANET'S SOIL, AND SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THAT THE VIKING MISSIONS IN THE 1970S MEASURED SIGNATURES OF THESE SALTS. "HOWEVER, THIS STUDY OF RSL DETECTED PERCHLORATES, NOW IN HYDRATED FORM, IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAN THOSE EXPLORED BY THE LANDERS," NASA SAID. "THIS ALSO IS THE FIRST TIME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM ORBIT." FOR OJHA, THE NEW FINDINGS ARE MORE PROOF THAT THE MYSTERIOUS LINES HE FIRST SAW DARKENING MARTIAN SLOPES FIVE YEARS AGO ARE, INDEED, PRESENT-DAY WATER. "WHEN MOST PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WATER ON MARS, THEY'RE USUALLY TALKING ABOUT ANCIENT WATER OR FROZEN WATER," HE SAID. "NOW WE KNOW THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY. THIS IS THE FIRST SPECTRAL DETECTION THAT UNAMBIGUOUSLY SUPPORTS OUR LIQUID WATER-FORMATION HYPOTHESES FOR RSL."
60	JAMES MADISON U START-UP GETS SEED FUNDING FOR OBSERVATION PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY BY DAVID SCHWARTZ PUBLISHED: SEPTEMBER 9TH, 2015 A HARRISONBURG, VA-BASED COMPANY SPUN OUT OF JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY (JMU) HAS CLOSED A $250,000 SEED ROUND TO COMMERCIALIZE A TETHERED, HOVERING OBSERVATION PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY. BLUE VIGILS INNOVATION IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A LOW ALTITUDE VANTAGE POINT WHILE CARRYING A WIDE VARIETY OF CAMERAS, SENSORS OR RADIO EQUIPMENT. THE TECHNOLOGY IS MOBILE, LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO USE, REMOVING THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MANPOWER OR TRAINING. BLUE VIGIL WILL OFFER A POWERFUL OBSERVATION AND COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, FIRST RESPONDERS, EVENT ORGANIZERS AND OTHERS, SAYS THE START-UPS CEO TODD STAVE. THE SUPPORT FROM THE HARRISONBURG INVESTMENT COMMUNITY AND JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY IS ALLOWING US TO RAPIDLY BRING THIS VALUABLE TECHNOLOGY TO THE MARKETS. INNOVATETECH VENTURES, A HERNDON, VA-BASED FIRM SPECIALIZING IN DEVELOPING EARLY-STAGE TECH COMPANIES, AND A SMALL GROUP OF REGIONAL INVESTORS WORKED WITH JMUS OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO IDENTIFY THE TECHNOLOGY, RECRUITING STAVE, AN EXPERIENCED ENTREPRENEUR, TO SERVE AS CEO. BRINGING TOGETHER PEOPLE TO CREATE LOCALLY BASED TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW JMU IS ENGAGED WITH THE COMMUNITY, SAYS UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT JONATHAN ALGER. THE UNIVERSITY HAS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH BLUE VIGIL TO PROVIDE THE START-UP WITH OFFICE SPACE AS WELL AS ACCESS TO INTERNS AND RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED TO KEEPING AT LEAST HALF OF ITS JOBS IN HARRISONBURG FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THE LAUNCH OF BLUE VIGIL THROUGH THE COLLABORATION OF JMU, INNOVATETECH AND HARRISONBURG PRIVATE INVESTORS IS A PRIVATE-PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP ENABLING THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF A DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY IN A MANNER WHICH SUPPORTS REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOALS, SAYS DR. YVONNE HARRIS, JMU VICE PROVOST FOR RESEARCH AND SCHOLARSHIP. JMU PLANS TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THESE PARTNERS TO DEVELOP MORE START-UPS USING THIS MODEL.

62	RIGHT NOW MORE THAN 3,000 REFUGEES ARE GATHERING IN CALAIS HOPING TO JUMP ON A FERRY, TRUCK OR TRAIN TO ENTER THE UNITED KINGDOM UNDETECTED BY POLICE OR BORDER PATROL. AND THE NUMBERS ARE GROWING EVERY SINGLE DAY. AN UNBEARABLE SITUATION FOR THE MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE FLED SYRIA DUE TO THE CIVIL WAR CAUSED BY THE RUTHLESS ASSAD REGIME, OR WHO HAVE LEFT COUNTRIES LIKE ERITREA, SOMALIA OR CHAD IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE POVERTY AND SEEK A SAFE AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE. MAGNETIC UK GREAT BRITAIN IS LIKE A MAGNET FOR MANY BECAUSE OF THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK OR THAT FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO LIVE THERE ALREADY CAN PROVIDE SHELTER FOR THE NEW ARRIVALS. ONE CAN CLEARLY SEE HOW EXPLOSIVE THE SITUATION HAS BECOME IN CALAIS, WHERE A GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE SO DESPERATE TO CROSS THE CHANNEL THAT SEPARATES FRANCE AND THE UK, BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE. TRUCKS ARE THE PREFERRED HIDING PLACES WHILE TRUCKS ARE QUEUING UP, WAITING TO BOARD THE FERRY AT CALAIS, REFUGEES OFTEN JUMP ON THE TRAILERS OR TRY TO HIDE IN THE SPACE BETWEEN BRIDGES AND TRAILERS TO GET ACROSS THE CHANNEL WITHOUT ANYONE FINDING OUT, ACCORDING TO SIMON BITTER, COO WALLENBORN GROUP, DESCRIBING THE DAILY SITUATION HIS DRIVERS ARE EXPOSED TO. THOSE DESPERATE AND OFTEN PERILOUS ATTEMPTS BY THE CLANDESTINE ENTRANTS TO THE UK HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN FATAL ACCIDENTS. TRUCKS ARE EQUIPPED WITH DETECTION EQUIPMENT WALLENBORN HAS TAKEN SOME PRECAUTIONS TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF STOWAWAYS JUMPING ON BOARD THEIR AIR FREIGHT TRUCKS, HIGHLY ENDANGERING THEIR LIVES; ASSERTS SIMON, WITHOUT REVEALING SENSITIVE DETAILS. ALL OF OUR TRAILERS ARE LOCKED UP AND EQUIPPED WITH INTERNAL SENSORS. SHOULD SOMEONE STILL MANAGE TO GET INSIDE, THE DETECTOR TRIGGERS AN ALERT SIGNAL THAT IS SENT TO OUR TWO DRIVERS AND OUR LUXEMBOURG HEAD OFFICE SIMULTANEOUSLY, HE SAYS. IN THAT CASE DRIVERS HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO STOP THEIR TRUCK AT THE NEAREST POLICE CHECKPOINT. ACCORDING TO MR. BITTER, THE ENTIRE SECURITY SET-UP WAS PRESENTED TO THE UK BORDER FORCE AND CERTIFIED BY THEIR EXPERTS AFTER THOROUGH TECHNICAL INSPECTIONS. "WITH THIS CERTIFICATION WE ARE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES BY OFFERING A VERY ROBUST AND SECURE TRANSPORTATION SET-UP FOR SHIPMENTS TO THE UK", EMPHASIZES FRANTZ WALLENBORN, CEO OF WALLENBORN TRANSPORTS. HE GOES ON TO SAY: "WE ARE ALREADY TAPA TSR 1 CERTIFIED AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CERTIFICATION WILL FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR FOCUS ON SECURITY AND INTEGRITY TO PROTECT OUR CLIENTS ASSETS." COSTLY FINES UNDER UK CIVIL PENALTY LEGISLATION, TRUCKING COMPANIES MAY HAVE TO PAY FINES IF THEY CARRY CLANDESTINE ENTRANTS TO GREAT BRITAIN IN THEIR VEHICLES. ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE THE CAMERON ADMINISTRATION HAS SET UP A CIVIL PENALTY ACCREDITATION SCHEME TO REDUCE THE RISK OF RECEIVING FINES BY ENSURING THAT COMPANIES HAVE EFFECTIVE SYSTEMS TO REDUCE CLANDESTINE ENTRANTS. THE TERM REFERS TO PERSONS WHO HIDE IN A VEHICLE, WITH THE AIM OF AVOIDING IMMIGRATION CONTROLS, AS THE VEHICLE ENTERS THE UNITED KINGDOM. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, VEHICLE OWNERS, HIRERS AND DRIVERS CAN BE FINED UP TO 2,000 FOR EACH CLANDESTINE ENTRANT THEY CARRY. THIS COULD BECOME A COSTLY MATTER FOR UNCERTIFIED COMPANIES, CONSIDERING THE LARGE AMOUNT OF REFUGEES TYING TO GET INTO THE UK UNDETECTED, REGARDLESS OF THE ENORMOUS RISK TO LIFE AND LIMB. OVER 200 RUNS PER WEEK BOTH WAYS CARGO TRAFFIC ACROSS THE CHANNEL IS A BUSINESS MAINSTAY FOR WALLENBORN. ON AVERAGE WE OPERATE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TRUCKS BETWEEN MAINLAND EUROPE AND THE UK PER WEEK, IN EACH DIRECTION, STATES COO BITTER. AIR FREIGHT CONSIGNMENTS ACCOUNT FOR 85 PERCENT OF THE LOADS, HE SAYS. THE GOODS ARE MOSTLY BROUGHT TO OR PICKED UP AT LONDON HEATHROW, BECAUSE SOME OF WALLENBORNS MAIN CLIENTS DONT SERVE LONDON BY FREIGHTER. SO WE FEED THEIR GOODS IN AND OUT HEATHROW, BUT ALSO SERVE MANCHESTER IN CASE THERE IS SUFFICIENT TONNAGE. HEINER SIEGMUND / MICHAEL TAWEEL

66	LONDON TODAY BECOMES THE FIRST UK CITY TO BAN LORRIES WHICH DO NOT HAVE EQUIPMENT TO PROTECT CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS. HEAVY GOODS VEHICLES (HGVS) IN THE CAPITAL MUST NOW BE FITTED WITH GUARDS AT THE SIDE TO HELP PREVENT CYCLISTS BEING DRAGGED UNDER WHEELS IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT. THEY MUST ALSO HAVE A SPECIAL TYPE OF MIRROR THAT HELPS THE DRIVER SEE THOSE RIDING BICYCLES OR ON FOOT. ANY THAT DO NOT HAVE THE EQUIPMENT FITTED WILL RECEIVE A FINE OF UP TO 1,000. DRIVERS OR HAULIERS WHO OFFEND SEVERAL TIMES RISK LOSING THEIR OPERATING LICENCE. EIGHT CYCLISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN ROAD ACCIDENTS THIS YEAR, SEVEN OF WHICH INVOLVED HGVS. LONDON MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON HAILED BRITAIN'S FIRST SAFER LORRY SCHEME AS A LIFE-SAVER. THE MAYOR SAID: "WE ARE AHEAD OF ANY OTHER PART OF THE UK IN CLOSING THE LEGAL LOOPHOLES THAT ALLOWED MANY HGVS TO OPERATE WITHOUT BASIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT, AND I AM DELIGHTED THAT, OVER THE 18 MONTHS SINCE WE ANNOUNCED THE SAFER LORRY SCHEME, THE VAST MAJORITY OF OPERATORS HAVE GOT THE MESSAGE AND FITTED SAFETY EQUIPMENT TO THEIR VEHICLES IN ANTICIPATION OF THE BAN. "WE HAVE, FROM THIS MORNING, BEGUN VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST THE LAGGARDS. "A VERY DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF CYCLIST DEATHS AND SERIOUS INJURIES ARE CAUSED BY LORRIES, AND TODAY'S SCHEME WILL UNDOUBTEDLY SAVE LIVES." MR JOHNSON ALSO SAID HE WANTED ALL LORRIES TO BE RETROFITTED WITH BIGGER SIDE WINDOWS TO CUT BLIND SPOTS FOR DRIVERS. THE NEW RULES WILL OPERATE 24 HOURS A DAY AND COVER EVERY ROAD IN THE CAPITAL EXCEPT MOTORWAYS. BUT REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE HAULAGE INDUSTRY SAID THE AMOUNT BEING SPENT ON LAUNCHING THE SCHEME COULD BE BETTER SPENT ON ENFORCING PREVIOUS GUIDELINES. NATALIE CHAPMAN, HEAD OF POLICY FOR LONDON AT THE FREIGHT TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION (FTA), SAID: "FTA IS PLEASED THAT THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS AND CONCESSIONS FOR VEHICLES WHERE THIS EQUIPMENT IS EITHER NOT POSSIBLE OR NOT LEGAL. "HOWEVER, IN PRINCIPLE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS KIND OF BLUNT REGULATORY TOOL IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE CYCLIST SAFETY. "WE STILL THINK THAT THE MONEY AND EFFORT INVESTED IN THIS SCHEME WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SPENT ON INCREASED ENFORCEMENT AGAINST THE SMALL PROPORTION OF LORRIES THAT DON'T COMPLY WITH EXISTING REGULATIONS. THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO ACHIEVE SAFER ROADS FOR ALL USERS."

71	THE ROYSAMBU ROUNDABOUT ON THIKA ROAD HAS TWO FUNCTIONS. IT ALLOWS VEHICLES TO JOIN OR LEAVE THE SUPERHIGHWAY ABOVE IT TO CONNECT WITH THE ADJACENT KAMITI AND KASARANI ROADS WITHOUT SLOWING DOWN TRAFFIC ON THE EXPRESSWAY. AND, ON SUNDAYS, IT DOUBLES UP AS A PARK. BEING ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING OPEN SPACES IN THE SURROUNDING ESTATES OF ROYSAMBU, ZIMMERMAN, KAHAWA WEST, GITHURAI 44, KASARANI AND MWIKI ESTATES, CHILDREN FLOCK TO THE AREA, ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR PARENTS OR HOUSEHELPS. AS THE CHILDREN PLAY, THE GUARDIANS CATCH UP WITH LOCAL NEWS, ALL THE WHILE KEEPING AN EYE ON POSSIBLE DANGER FROM THE SURROUNDING ROADS WHERE TRAFFIC FLOWS CONSTANTLY. FOOD VENDORS, PHOTOGRAPHERS AND FACE PAINTERS ARE ALSO AT HAND TO CASH IN ON THE RUSH. THE SITUATION IS REPEATED EVERY SUNDAY. MS HELLEN MWIKALI, A HOUSEHELP IN ZIMMERMAN, HAS BEEN BRINGING HER EMPLOYER'S TWO CHILDREN TO THE ROYSAMBU ROUNDABOUT FOR THE PAST FIVE MONTHS. SHE SAYS IT IS THE ONLY SPACE LEFT WHERE CHILDREN CAN PLAY SAFELY. "THEIR MOTHER CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO PLAY OUTSIDE THEIR HOME FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS. THERE IS A RISK OF STEPPING ON RAW SEWAGE, BEING HIT BY BODABODAS OR GETTING LOST AS TOO MANY FLATS ARE COMING UP," SHE SAYS. SHE ADMITS THAT THE ROUNDABOUT IS NOT ANY SAFER, OWING TO THE DANGER OF BEING HIT BY A VEHICLE, BUT SAYS IT IS IS CLEAN. ALSO, SHE CAN EASILY KEEP AN EYE ON THE TWO GIRLS, AGED FOUR AND SIX YEARS. "PLUS, IT OFFERS ME AN OPEN SPACE TO RELAX AS I'M CONFINED TO A TWO-BEDROOM APARTMENT MOST OF THE WEEK, THE ONLY OPEN SPACE BEING A BALCONY" SHE SAYS. MS MWIKALI'S SITUATION IS NOT UNIQUE. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF NAIROBI, IN UTHIRU, THE ROUNDABOUT NEXT TO THE INTERNATIONAL LIVESTOCK RESEARCH INSTITUTE ALSO FUNCTIONS AS A PARK ON WEEKENDS. AS KENYA'S REAL ESTATE BOOM CONTINUES, ESPECIALLY IN URBAN CENTRES, A CAPITALIST STREAK IS LEAVING NO ROOM FOR LEISURE AND RELAXATION, TAKING UP ALL THE OPEN SPACES. STATE INEPTITUDE, TOO, HAS ALLOWED LAND GRABBERS TO TAKE ALL THE AVAILABLE OPEN SPACES THAT ARE IDEALLY SUPPOSED TO OPERATE AS PUBLIC SPACES. HAPHAZARD CONSTRUCTION, BLATANT DISREGARD OF THE LAW, AND LACK OF LEGAL ENFORCEMENT ARE FAST TURNING URBAN CENTRES INTO LAWLESS CONCRETE JUNGLES. THE BUILDING CODE, FOR INSTANCE, STATES THAT A RESIDENTIAL BUILDING SHOULD HAVE SPACE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF IT WHICH EXTENDS THE WHOLE WIDTH OF THE BUILDING AND NOT LESS THAN 20FT WIDE FROM THE NEXT BUILDING. IT SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A STREET OR ROAD. ADDITIONALLY, "A BUILDING DESIGNED FOR RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES SHALL HAVE AN OPEN SPACE ON ONE SIDE WITH A WIDTH OF 8FT OR MORE MEASURED FROM THE BOUNDARY OF THE NEAREST PLOT. THE WIDTH SHOULD EXTEND THE ENTIRE LENGTH AND HEIGHT OF THE BUILDING," IT SAYS. "IF A RESIDENTIAL HOUSE CONTAINS MORE THAN ONE DWELLING, IT SHOULD HAVE A COURTYARD OR OPEN SPACE FREE FROM OBSTRUCTION OF NOT LESS THAN 350SQ FEET AND HAVE DIMENSIONS OF NOT LESS THAN 15FT, WHILE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED SPACE BETWEEN ANY TWO BUILDINGS IS FOUR FEET," IT SAYS. SUCH SPACING REQUIREMENTS ARE NECESSARY NOT ONLY FOR SAFETY BUT FOR DOMESTIC USES AS THEY ACT AS OPEN SPACES FOR RESIDENTS. BUT IN HIGH DENSITY AREAS LIKE UMOJA, DOONHOLM, KASARANI, KAYOLE, ROYSAMBU, PIPELINE AND KASARANI, HIGHRISE APARTMENTS SIT BACK TO BACK, WITH NO SPACE BETWEEN THEM EVEN FOR SUNLIGHT TO COME THROUGH. THIS HAS LEFT CHILDREN AND PARENTS WITH LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO INNOVATE. IN NAIROBI, GAMING ZONES ARE INCREASINGLY SPROUTING UP IN MANY LOW INCOME URBAN CENTRES. CHILDREN PAY ABOUT SH10 FOR A 10-MINUTE SESSION AT A GAMING CONSOLE CONNECTED TO A TV SCREEN. A NEW PLAYSTATION 4 VIDEO GAME CONSOLE -- THE LATEST MODEL IN THE MARKET -- COSTS SH45,000, WHICH IS TOO COSTLY FOR LOW INCOME PARENTS. MANY OF THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THEIR OWN CONSOLES, OR TO PAY TO PLAY, USE INCOMPLETE CONSTRUCTION SITES FOR RECREATION, OR SHARE SPACES WITH VEHICLES ON NEARBY ROADS. BUT DANGER IS ALWAYS LURKING. LAST MONTH, TWO BOYS WERE RUN OVER BY A BUS AS THEY RODE A BICYCLE IN UMOJA ESTATE, NAIROBI. IN JANUARY, A MATATU USING KALOLENI ESTATE TO ESCAPE A TRAFFIC GRIDLOCK ON THE BUSY JOGOO ROAD HIT A BOY PLAYING FOOTBALL ON AN ESTATE ROAD. MR EZRA OLACK, THE ESTATE'S CHAIRMAN, SAYS: "ALL THE PLAYING FIELDS HERE HAVE BEEN GRABBED. WE HAVE WRITTEN MANY LETTERS TO THE NATIONAL LAND COMMISSION (NLC) AND THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT OF NAIROBI BUT THE GOVERNMENT ACTS ONLY WHEN SOMETHING CATASTROPHIC HAPPENS," HE SAYS. LAST DECEMBER, A NUMBER OF NAIROBI COUNTY OFFICIALS WERE SUSPENDED AFTER IT EMERGED THAT A BUILDING THAT COLLAPSED IN THE AREA KILLING SEVEN PEOPLE HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED ON GRABBED WETLAND. THE NAIROBI COUNTY GOVERNMENT MARKED SOME BUILDINGS NEAR THE AREA FOR DEMOLITION, SAYING THEY WERE CONSTRUCTED ON GRABBED LAND, BUT NO DEMOLITION HAS TAKEN PLACE YET. MR OLACK, WHO GREW UP IN THE AREA, SAYS THE CURRENT GENERATION OF CHILDREN IS BEING DENIED REAL RECREATION. "WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, KIDS USED TO GROUP TOGETHER AND LEAVE THEIR HOMES TO PLAY VARIOUS GAMES. THESE MADE GOOD CHILDHOOD MEMORIES. BUT IT IS ALL DISAPPEARING, NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY BUT FOR LACK OF SPACE." SO BAD IS THE SITUATION, ESPECIALLY IN NAIROBI, THAT A MOTION WAS MOVED IN THE COUNTY ASSEMBLY THREE WEEKS AGO ASKING HEADTEACHERS TO ALLOW CHILDREN TO USE SCHOOL PLAYGROUNDS DURING HOLIDAYS. "THE SOCIETY IS RAISING CHILDREN WHO BECOME SELF-CENTRED OR INTROVERTS, AS THEY ARE ALWAYS INDOORS PLAYING WITH PLAYSTATIONS OR WATCHING TV," SAYS LAINI SABA WARD REPRESENTATIVE DAVID KITAVI WHO IS BEHIND THE MOTION. THE KENYA PAEDIATRIC ASSOCIATION SAYS CHILDREN GROWING UP IN URBAN AREAS FACE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR. "CHILDREN HAVE HIGH ENERGY LEVELS AND CANNOT STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG. THEY NEED TO PLAY". MOST PARENTS TRY TO KEEP THEM BUSY WITH TELEVISION, COMPUTERS OR MOBILE PHONES BUT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH," SAYS THE ASSOCIATION'S CHAIRMAN, MR DAVID GITHANGA. "WHEN THEY GROW OLDER, THESE CHILDREN COULD TURN TO ALCOHOL, NARCOTICS AND ILLICIT SEX OWING TO THESE ANTI-SOCIAL SETTINGS," SAYS DR GITHANGA. THE COUNTRY WAS SHOCKED LAST MONTH WHEN POLICE IN MURANG'A INTERCEPTED A MATATU FERRYING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM NYERI WHO WERE SMOKING BHANG AND HAVING SEX. THE STUDENTS FROM VARIOUS SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTY HAD HIRED THE MATATU TO FERRY THEM TO NAIROBI. NLC SAYS A DELAY IN PASSING THREE CRUCIAL BILLS IS STANDING IN THE WAY OF LAND REFORMS THAT WOULD RETURN THESE PUBLIC UTILITIES TO THE PEOPLE. "THE COMMUNITY LAND BILL, HISTORICAL LAND INJUSTICES BILL, PHYSICAL AND URBAN PLANNING BILL, AMONG OTHERS, ARE STILL PENDING, DELAYING LAND REFORMS," NLC CHAIR MUHAMAD SWAZURI SAYS. "HOWEVER, IN CONJUNCTION WITH COUNTY LAND MANAGEMENT OFFICES, WE ARE PERFORMING AN AUDIT OF ALL PUBLIC UTILITIES IN KENYA THAT HAVE BEEN GRABBED," HE SAYS.

73	KP, CABRAAL AND ARJUNA MAHENDRAN CASES: BY THERE IS A DISCERNIBLE SHIFT IN THE LEGAL POSITION RELATING TO CERTAIN CONTROVERSIAL CHARACTERS WHO HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF SERIOUS CRIMES. PEOPLE ARE BEWILDERED AS TO HOW THIS VOLTE-FACE TOOK PLACE. THE SUNDAY OBSERVER SOUGHT THE VIEWS OF JUSTICE MINISTER DR. WIJEYADASA RAJAPAKSHE ON THIS MATTER. Q: HOW IS IT THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (AG) IS NOW TAKING UP THE POSITION THAT KUMARAN PATHMANATHAN ALIAS KP DIDNT CARRY OUT ANY TERRORIST ACTIVITY? A: THE AGS STAND IS THAT THERE WAS NO ADEQUATE EVIDENCE TO ARREST THE HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL DIVISION AND THE CHIEF PROCURER OF THE LTTE, KP AND INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT SO FAR DID NOT REVEAL ANY CRIME HE HAD COMMITTED. ACCORDING TO MY UNDERSTANDING, THE AG HAS NOT ARRIVED AT THAT CONCLUSION. WHAT HE SAYS IS THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND THE EXACT MATERIALS SO FAR TO PROVE AS TO HOW HE WAS ENGAGED WITH THE LTTE. IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT KP WAS SERVING THE LTTE. BUT WHEN THE AG HAS TO TAKE DECISIONS TO PROSECUTE SOMEONE, HE SHOULD HAVE PROOF. HE CANNOT SIMPLY GO TO COURTS AND FILE ACTION. Q: KP WAS PUBLICLY ACCUSED OF FUNDING THE LTTE. MALAYSIA COOPERATED IN THE ARREST OF KP AND DEPORTING HIM TO SRI LANKA AS HE WAS SUSPECTED TO HAVE HAD LINKS WITH TERRORISTS. YOUR COMMENTS? A: STILL INVESTIGATIONS ARE ON-GOING AND IT IS NOT A MATTER FOR THE AG TO CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION. THE POLICE WILL CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION. THEREAFTER, IF ANY MATERIAL COMES OUT OF IT, THE AG WILL TAKE ACTIONS. THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. I DONT HAVE MUCH DETAILS, BUT THE POLICE IS LOOKING INTO THE MATTER. Q:INVESTIGATIONS OF LTTE ACTIVITIES IN SOUTH INDIA BY THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT KP WAS LINKED TO LTTE TERRORISM IN A MAJOR WAY. HAS NOT INDIA ASKED FOR KPS EXTRADITION TO FRAME CHARGES RELATED TO TERRORISM. WHAT IS THE EXPLANATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE TO INDIA? A: THE FOREIGN MINISTRY IS DISCUSSING THAT AND WE ARE ALSO HAVING OUR DIPLOMATIC UNDERSTANDING. ACTUALLY, IT IS A MATTER OF TIME AND THERE WILL BE A DECISION SOON. Q: WHAT ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS KP IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HANDLED IN FUNDING THE LTTE. IS THIS TRUE? A: WE WILL HAVE TO ASK THE FORMER REGIME UNLESS THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN THESE DETAILS TO US. BECAUSE THE FORMER REGIME HAD ALL THE DEALINGS WITH KP AND THEY KNOW ALL THE DETAILS. BUT OFFICIALLY THAT HAS NOT BEEN TRANSPIRED SO FAR. ONCE IT TRANSPIRES, THEN WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE ACTION. Q: IN THE CLOSING PHASE OF THE WAR IN 2009, THERE WERE ACCUSATIONS THAT MANY LTTE LEADERS INCLUDING VELUPILLAI PRABHAKARAN AND SOME OF HIS FAMILY MEMBERS WERE KILLED AFTER THEY HAD BEEN CAPTURED. NOW VINAYAGAMOORTHY MURALITHARAN ALIAS KARUNA CLAIMS THAT PRABHAKARAN HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE BY SHOOTING HIMSELF. AS JUSTICE MINISTER, DO YOU REGARD KARUNAS CLAIM AS AN END TO THIS WHOLE MYSTERY ABOUT THE DEATH OF PRABHAKARAN? CAN A POLITICIAN AND EX-TERRORIST SUCH AS KARUNA WHO FACES TERRORISM ACCUSATIONS BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY FOR FORENSIC EVIDENCE? WHAT ABOUT THE OFFICIAL CONCLUSIONS OF PRABHAKARANS DEATH? A: I DONT BELIEVE IN WHAT KARUNA SAYS. HE WAS AN LTTE CADRE AND AN LTTE LEADER AS WELL. WE WILL ONLY BELIEVE WHAT OUR SECURITY FORCES CONFIRM. IF IT IS SO, KARUNA WOULD HAVE MADE THAT STATEMENT DURING THE TENURE OF PREVIOUS REGIME WHILE HE WAS HOLDING AN IMPORTANT MINISTERIAL PORTFOLIO OF THAT GOVERNMENT. HE WOULD HAVE DISCLOSED THAT INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT. WHY DID HE WAIT UNTIL THAT GOVERNMENT CHANGED. THAT SHOWS HIS DUAL ROLE. HE WAS ALSO A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SLFP DURING THE REGIME OF FORMER PRESIDENT MAHINDA RAJAPAKSA. WHAT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE SECURITY FORCES IS ACCEPTED BY THE WHOLE WORLD. Q: AS JUSTICE MINISTER, DO YOU SEE THE NEED FOR FORENSIC EXPERT ANALYSIS OF PRABHAKARANS DEATH, NOW THAT THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RAISED? A: I DONT THINK WE NEED TO WASTE TIME ON THIS ISSUE SINCE PRABHAKARAN AND THE LTTE IS NO MORE . WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES. NOBODY IS RAISING THEIR VOICE TO FIND OUT AS TO HOW PRABHAKARAN DIED. Q: IF LONG SUSPECT TERRORISTS SUCH AS KP AND KARUNA HAVE SUDDENLY TURNED OUT TO BE GOOD GUYS, DO YOU THINK THAT THE EKNALIGODA DISAPPEARANCE COULD ALSO TAKE A SUDDEN TURN AWAY FROM ANY CRIMINAL IMPLICATION? A: I CANNOT TALK ON ASSUMPTIONS. IT IS A MATTER FOR THE POLICE TO INVESTIGATE AND GIVE US THE RESULTS. Q: IF STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO SEEMINGLY CLEAR KP OF TERRORISM CHARGES, SHOULDNT THERE BE SIMILAR LEGAL AND OFFICIAL CLARIFICATIONS ABOUT THE SUSPECTED TERRORIST RECORDS OF KARUNA AND SIVANESATHURAI CHANDRAKANTHAN ALIAS PILLAIYAN? A: THOSE ARE MATTERS FOR THE ARMY INTELLIGENCE AND WE CANNOT COMMENT ON IT. AS FAR AS THE SECURITY ASPECTS OF THE COUNTRY IS CONCERNED, THERE IS INFORMATION THAT WE CANNOT DIVULGE TO THE MEDIA.THIS IS NOT WITHIN MY MINISTRYS PURVIEW AND IT COMES UNDER THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE. Q: WILL THE INVESTIGATION OF EKNALIGODA AND HIS POSSIBLE MURDER GO BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE PERPETRATORS AND IDENTIFY WHO WAS REALLY GUILTY OF ORDERING SUCH A CRIME? A: I CANNOT COMMENT ON THIS. BECAUSE I DONT KNOW ANY OF THOSE MATTERS EXCEPT FOR WHAT THE POLICE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE DISCLOSED. BEING A MINISTER, I THINK IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR US TO MAKE COMMENTS OR EXPRESS VIEWS WHILE THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE ON-GOING. LET THE POLICE AND THE COURT DECIDE. AT PRESENT, THE POLICE IS GOING AHEAD WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS. BUT IF THERE ARES ANY FURTHER QUERIES TO BE MADE, WE WILL APPOINT A COMMITTEE OR A COMMISSION TO INQUIRE. Q: EVEN IN THE CASE OF WASIM THAJUDEEN WILL INVESTIGATIONS GO BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE PERPETRATORS TO IDENTIFY THOSE GUILTY OF THIS CRIME? A: I DONT THINK WE CAN DISCUSS THOSE MATTERS BECAUSE THOSE MATTERS ARE SUB JUDICE. WE CANNOT DISCUSS CASES WHICH ARE PENDING BECAUSE THAT WILL HAMPER THE INVESTIGATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS AN INTERFERENCE IN THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. Q: COURT CASES PERTAINING TO ACTIONS BY THE PREVIOUS CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR AJITH NIVARD CABRAAL AND INCUMBENT ARJUNA MAHENDRAN SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BRUSHED UNDER THE CARPET. DOES THIS MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE NO FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS ON THESE TWO OFFICIALS? A: WITH REGARD TO THE SUSPICION, THE COURT WILL LOOK INTO THE LEGAL ASPECTS. IF THERE IS ANY VIOLATION OF THE LAW, IT IS A MATTER FOR THE COURT. NOW THE SUPREME COURT HAS DISMISSED ONE OF THE APPLICATION SAYING THAT THERE WAS NO IRREGULARITY OR FRAUD. THAT IS THE LEGAL ASPECT. WE WILL LOOK INTO THE MORAL AND ETHICAL ASPECTS THROUGH A PARLIAMENTARY SELECT COMMITTEE, THE COPE. IF IT IS NECESSARY, WE WILL GO AHEAD WITH THAT INQUIRY WHEN THE COPE IS SET UP.
74	HA NOI (VNS) THE USE OF ASBESTOS IN ROOFING SHEET PLANTS IN VIET NAM HAS LED TO SEVERE CONSEQUENCES FOR WORKERS' HEALTH, A WORKSHOP IN HA NOI WAS TOLD ON TUESDAY. THE EVENT WAS CO-ORGANISED BY THE VIET NAM UNION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATIONS (VUSTA), THE ENVIRONMENT HEALTH MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT UNDER THE HEALTH MINISTRY AND VIET NAM BAN ASBESTOS NETWORK (VN-BAN). "WHITE ASBESTOS IS HARMFUL TO HUMAN HEALTH. IT CAN CAUSE PNEUMOCONIOSIS, PLEURAL EFFUSION AND OTHER FATAL DISEASES SUCH AS LUNG CANCER, MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA, ESOPHAGEAL CANCER AND OVARIAN CANCER," SAID VICE CHAIRMAN OF VUSTA, PHAN TUNG MAU. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION (WHO) HAS LISTED ASBESTOS AMONG THE MOST DEADLY OCCUPATIONAL CARCINOGENS. IT SAYS IT CAUSES ABOUT HALF THE CANCER DEATHS IN THE WORKPLACE. THERE ARE MORE THAN 40 FACTORIES MAKING ASBESTOS ROOFING ACROSS 23 PROVINCES AND CITIES NATIONWIDE. OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN AMONG THE WORLD'S 10 LARGEST USERS OF ASBESTOS. IT CONSUMES ABOUT 65,000TONNES EVERY YEAR. HOSPITAL SURVEILLANCE 2012 SHOWED A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF ASBESTOS-RELATED DISEASES. VIET NAM HAS ALREADY TAKEN MEASURES TO REDUCE THE HARM OF ASBESTOS TO HEALTH. THE USE OF AMOSITE (BROWN ASBESTOS) AND CROCIDOLITE (BLUE ASBESTOS) WERE PROHIBITED IN 2004. HOWEVER, CHRYSOTILE (WHITE ASBESTOS) HAS YET TO BE BANNED. "ASBESTOS IS A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL THAT AFFECTS NOT ONLY WORKERS BUT ALSO CONSUMERS OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING IT," SAID TRAN TUAN, DIRECTOR OF THE RESEARCH AND TRAINING CENTRE FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT (RTCCD). "IN VIET NAM, MOST ASBESTOS ROOFING SHEETS ARE USED BY PEOPLE WITH LOW INCOMES AND IN HOUSING PROGRAMME FOR THE POOR ," TUAN SAID. "IN THE LONG TERM, THOSE PEOPLE'S HEALTH WILL BE SEVERELY IMPACTED, LEADING TO POVERTY AND ILLNESS," HE ADDED. THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO REPLACE ASBESTOS. THE MINISTRY OF CONSTRUCTION WAS INSTRUCTED TO DEVELOP A SPECIFIC ROADMAP FOR THE ELIMINATION PROCEDURE OF WHITE ASBESTOS IN ROOFING PRODUCTION IN 2020. THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH WAS ASKED TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A NATIONAL ACTION PLAN ON ERADICATING ASBESTOS-RELATED DISEASES. VNS
75	ONTARIO DOCTORS WARN THAT PATIENTS WILL HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CUTTING THEIR FEES. THE GOVERNMENT IS CHOPPING FEES BY 1.3 PER CENT STARTING NEXT WEEK TO KEEP THE PROFESSION WITHIN AN ALLOTTED $11.6-BILLION BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. DR.  THE COMPANY HAS A MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF $1.01 BILLION AND A P/E RATIO OF 48.51.  PROVENZANO SAID COUNTY JAIL OFFICIALS ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE AGREEMENT WITH HUNTERDON COUNTY CAN BE HANDLED WITHOUT HIRING ADDITIONAL STAFF. MICHAEL TOTH, PRESIDENT OF THE ONTARIO MEDICAL ASSOCIATION , SAYS THE PROFESSION IS FRUSTRATED AND SOME MEMBERS ARE TALKING ABOUT LEAVING THE PROVINCE OR RETIRING EARLY. "IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PATIENTS ULTIMATELY," HE WARNED, NOTING THAT SOME PHYSICIANS WILL BE FORCED TO LAY OFF STAFF AND CUT OFFICE BUDGETS. PHYSICIANS ARE VENTING THEIR ANGER ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ON TWITTER , HARDLINERS ARE THREATENING JOB ACTION SUCH AS A WORK-TO-RULE CAMPAIGN, HOUR CUTBACKS AND CANCELLATION OF FLU-SHOT CLINICS. TOTH SAID THE OMA, WHICH REPRESENTS 28,000 MEMBERS, WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH GOVERNMENT AND IS CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION. HEALTH MINISTER ERIC HOSKINS SAID HE WANTS TO REASSURE ONTARIANS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERVICE CUTS.  BUT THEIR ACTIONS SINCE ASSUMING OFFICE HAVE LEFT NO DOUBT IN MANY MINDS THAT THEIR SELECTION WAS A GRAVE MISTAKE.  PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY THE XI'AN ZONE IS NOW EXPECTED TO FURTHER SPEED UP ITS DEVELOPMENT AND INCREASINGLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE REGION AND THE COUNTRY. "MY CONCERN IS THAT A PERCEPTION IS BEING PROPAGATED THAT THIS WILL RESUULT IN MORE CHALLENGING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE FACTS SIMBPLY DON'T BEAR THIS OUT," HE SAID. ONTARIO DOCTORS ARE AMONG THE BEST PAID IN CANADA WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF ABOUT $350,000, AN AMOUNT THAT HAS GROWN BY 60 PER CENT OVER THAT LAST DECADE, HOSKINS SAID. FROM THAT, PHYSICIANS PAY OVERHEAD COSTS, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE WAGES AND OFFICE RENT, AN AMOUNT WIDELY QUOTED AS ABOUT 30 PER CENT. HOSKINS SAID PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED OVER WHAT IS A DISPUTE OVER REMUNERATION: "I HAVE RECEIVED ASSURANCE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE OMA THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE ACTION THAT WILL IMPACT THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY PROVIDE OR PATIENT SAFETY. I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD." THE RIFT DATES BACK TO A PAYMENT SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT UNILATERALLY IMPOSED LAST JANUARY AFTER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OMA ENDED IN AN IMPASSE. IT INCLUDED A 2.65 PER CENT FEE CUT AND A CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IF DOCTORS' OHIP BILLINGS WERE TAKING DOCTORS OVER THEIR $11.6-ALLOTMENT. THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENT MODEL ALLOWS DOCTORS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPENSATION. IF THEY SEE MORE PATIENTS AND PERFORM MORE PROCEDURES, THEY CAN BILL THE PUBLIC INSURANCE PLAN FOR MORE MONEY. THE PAYMENT SCHEME ALSO INCLUDES INCREASES OF 1.25 PER CENT IN THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES BUDGET FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  COMPLETELY FREE ACCESS TO OUR ANALYST RATINGS DATABASE FOR 6000+ STOCKS. THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE ANNUAL INCREASES ARE INTENDED TO MEET A RISE IN DEMAND FROM A GROWING AND AGING POPULATION AND THE ADDITION OF 700 NEW DOCTORS. BUT THE OMA CONTENDS INCREASES OF 2.7 PER CENT ARE NEEDED IN EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND GROWTH. THE OMA IS LOBBYING MPPS, HOLDING TOWN HALL MEETINGS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE PROVINCE AND STAGING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH MEMBERS NEXT WEEK. TOTH ARGUED THERE IS A "POWER IMBALANCE" WITH GOVERNMENT AND CALLED FOR A NEUTRAL THIRD-PARTY TO WEIGH IN WITH A BINDING DECISION: "WE ARE LOOKING TO RESOLVE THIS ... WE THINK THE WAY TO DO THIS IS MEDIATION-ARBITRATION."

78	IT JUST WASNT A MATTER OF NOT BEING PRETTY, IT WAS JUST PLAIN UGLY BY OHIO STATE STANDARDSA WIN OVER NORTHERN ILLINOIS THAT MIGHT WELL SIGNAL THE SHAKEOUT OF THINGS TO COME. COLUMBUS IF YOURE A FAN OF CARDALE JONES, OR IF YOURE ENAMORED WITH THE CARDALE JONES STORY, THE LEGACY SUCH AS IT IS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET A FILM OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF SATURDAYS 20-13 WIN OVER NORTHERN ILLINOIS. WHY? WELL, BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE THE LAST YOU SEE OF CARDALE JONES PLAYING QUARTERBACK FOR AWHILE. NEVER SAY NEVER IN SPORTS, BUT 4 OF 9 PASSING AND A PAIR OF INTERCEPTIONS AGAINST A MAC TEAM (EVEN A GOOD MAC TEAM) IS NO WAY TO BUILD UPON A LEGACY. IN FACT, ITS A PRETTY GOOD WAY TO GET YOURSELF BENCHED, WHICH IS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED TO JONES. ENTER J.T. BARRETT AT THE START OF THE SECOND QUARTER, WHO PLAYED THE REMAINING THREE, AND FRANKLYHAD SOME ISSUES OF HIS OWN. IF JONES WAS BAD (4 OF 9 FOR 36 YARDS AND 2 PICKS), BARRETT WAS MERELY SLUGGISH, UNINSPIRING, COMPLETING 11 OF 19 PASSES FOR 97 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN, ALONG WITH AN INTERCEPTION OF HIS OWN. IT WAS, IN THE VERNACULAR OF FOOTBALL, A BAD WIN. OHIO STATE DIDNT PLAY WELL FOR THE SECOND WEEK IN A ROWDIDNT EXECUTE, AND DIDNT APPEAR TO PLAY TO ITS STRENGTHS. TRANSLATION: URBAN MEYERS GAME PLAN SEEMED TO FIT RIGHT INTO THE PLANS OF AN ATHLETIC NORTHERN ILLINOIS DEFENSE THAT WAS QUICK ENOUGH TO CHASE DOWN RUNNING BACKS TRYING TO RUN SIDELINE TO SIDELINE. AND MORE THAN ONE OF THE 104,095 THAT WATCHED HAD TO HAVE ASKED THE QUESTION. WHY NOT GIVE THE BALL TO EZEKIEL ELLIOTT AND RUN RIGHT AT EM BEHIND THAT MASSIVE OFFENSIVE LINE? BUT TO THE ISSUE OF QUARTERBACK, MEYER WAS ASKED AFTERWARDS BY ABC ABOUT HOW TO FIX IT. HIS REPLY? WELL, WE HAD A GREAT WEEK OF PRACTICE AND PRACTICE IS THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO GO ON (WHEN YOU PICK A QUARTERBACK). BUT WE HAVE TO GET THAT FIXED. IN HIS POST-GAME PRESS CONFERENCE MEYER CONTINUALLY USED THE WORD DISCOMBOBULATED. SO I KNOW THERES GOING TO BE A MILLION QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFENSE. AND THERE SHOULD BE. THERES A LITTLE DISCOMBOBULATION THATS GOT TO GET WORKED OUT, AND WEVE GOT GOOD PLAYERS, GOOD COACHES, GOOD SCHEME. LINEBACKER DARRON LEE EYES THE GOAL LINE AFTER HIS INTERCEPTION IN THE THIRD QUARTER. HIS TOUCHDOWN RUN OF 43 YARDS WAS THE WINNING MARGIN IN THE GAME. IM OKAY WITH WINNING GAMES. IM NOT OKAY WITH THE FIVE TURNOVERS AND LACKING EXECUTION AND NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, BECAUSE THATS A RECIPE FOR FAILURE, AT SOME POINT (IF YOU DO THAT) YOULL FAIL MISERABLY. TURNOVERS, IF YOU CANT CONTROL THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, YOURE NOT GOING TO WIN A BIG GAME. AND THOSE TWO THINGS HAVE TO GET FIXED FAST. THE REALITY OF SATURDAYS LACKLUSTER WIN IS THIS. IF DARRON LEE DOESNT PICK OFF A PASS FROM NIU QUARTERBACK DREW HARE WITH 1:44 LEFT IN THE THIRD QUARTER, AND RUN IT BACK 43 YARDS FOR A TOUCHDOWN, THERE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A WIN AT ALL. LEES PLAY WAS THE MARGIN OF DIFFERENCE. MORE MEYER: SINCE THE END OF LAST SEASON OUR DEFENSE HAS PLAYED EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. THEY HELD THEM (NIU) TO FAR BELOW THEIR OFFENSIVE AVERAGE TODAY, AND WITH THE FIVE TURNOVERSWELL, THATS EXCEPTIONAL PLAY BY OUR DEFENSE. THE DEFENSE WAS BRILLIANT, THE EVIDENT STRENGTH OF A TEAM THAT OFFENSIVELY PLAYED SATURDAY LIKE A DUCK THAT HAD BEEN STRUCK ON THE HEAD WITH A HAMMER. ITS VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I KNOW WERE CAPABLE OF EXECUTING MUCH BETTER, SAID OFFENSIVE TACKLE TAYLOR DECKER. OUR OFFENSE IS BEING HELD BACK BY US (THE OFFENSIVE LINE), BUT AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR WE WERENT PLAYING AT THAT LEVEL. YEAR-TO-YEAR WE KEEP GETTING BETTER AND I HAVE ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD IN OUR LINE. SAFETY VONN BELL ALREADY HAS ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD ABOUT THE DEFENSE. I THINK WERE PLAYING PHENOMENAL. WERE PLAYING AT A HIGH LEVEL SO HATS OFF TO THOSE GUYS. WERE NOT GIVING UP ANYTHING DEEP AND WERE BEING DISCIPLINED WHICH ALLOWS US TO MAKE PLAYS DOWN THE FIELD. WHICH IS GOOD, BECAUSE EXCEPT FOR AN EARLY TOUCHDOWN RUN BY TAILBACK AREGERO TURNER THE HUSKIES NEVER REALLY THREATENED AGAIN. JOEY BOSA AND ADOLPHUS WASHINGTON WERE BRILLIANT FROM THE DEFENSIVE LINE. BELL AND HIS SECONDARY MATES WERE SIMPLY TO ATHLETIC FOR THE HUSKY OFFENSE TO THREATEN. THERE WERE NO OPEN RECEIVERS FOR MOST OF THE DAY. STILL, THE PINK ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS THE QUARTERBACK POSITION AND LACK OF PRODUCTION FROM IT. MEYER REFUSES TO THROW ANYONE UNDER THE BUS AND WAS DIPLOMATIC WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHO STARTS NEXT WEEK AGAINST WESTERN MICHIGAN. I DONT KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW. I HAVENT HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT, HE ANSWERED. BUT IT WOULD BE HARD AT THIS POINT TO MAKE THE CASE FOR CARDALE JONES, WHO DIDNT PLAY WITH INSTINCT SATURDAY AND LOOKED ROBOTIC. AND, IT WOULD HARD TO ANOINT J.T. BARRETT, WHO AFTER COMING IN THREW A BEAUTIFUL FADE ROUTE FOR A TOUCHDOWN TO MICHAEL THOMAS ON HIS SECOND POSSESSION, LOOKED TENTATIVE AND UNSURE THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE SECOND HALF. THE BEAUTY OF ALL THIS IS, OF COURSE, ITS OHIO STATE FOOTBALL. AND AS MEYER ALLUDED TO BEFORE HE LEFT THE PRESS MEETING ROOM SATURDAY, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ARMCHAIR QUARTERBACKS WILL HAVE IT ALL FIGUREDAND A LOT OF IT FIXEDBY MONDAY. NOT THAT IM GOING TO CALL THE ARMCHAIR PEOPLE AND ASK THEM WHAT THEY THINK, HE SAID WITH A SMILE. BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT NEED FIXIN. FAST! THE SPOT IS PROUD TO SPONSOR COVERAGE OF THE OHIO STATE BUCKEYES ON PRESS PROS MAGAZINE.COM.
79	ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?). I KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME; I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THAT. BUT I JUST CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.  WHEN JUDGE CRAIG AGREED, THE ITALIAN SPARKED LAUGHTER FROM THE AUDIENCE BY PLAYFULLY FALLING OFF HIS CHAIR. PART OF ME WONDERS IF IM BEING TOO CLINGY ABOUT THIS? ITS THEIR LIVES AND I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO GET IT IN PRACTICE.  WE WANT THEM TO LEARN HOW TO REGULATE THEIR THOUGHTS, FEELINGS AND INTENSITY SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE HEALTHY DECISIONS AND HAVE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS IN ORDER TO LEAD A MEANINGFUL AND FULFILLING LIFE. ANOTHER PART WONDERS IF IM BEING UNFAIR TO RAOUL? MAYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR THEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE.  WHILE CURRENT SURGICAL OPTIONS, SUCH TURP CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN RELIEVING SYMPTOMS, IT CAN ALSO LEAVE PATIENTS WITH PERMANENT SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS URINARY INCONTINENCE, ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION AND RETROGRADE EJACULATION (DRY ORGASM). IVE THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW IM NOT AS BOTHERED AS I WAS INITIALLY. UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH.  TO 7 P.M. I STILL CANT FULLY COME TO TERMS WITH IT AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS BETTER THAN THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY I CANT JUST LIVE AND LET LIVE? WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO? SIGNED, OVERLY ANXIOUS FOR NO GOOD REASON DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, LATELY IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER.  YOUR NEEDS WILL BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN ENSURING THAT YOU WILL CHOOSE OPTIONS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO MEET ALL THE OPERATIONAL NEEDS OF YOUR FIRM. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS (LETS CALL THEM RAOUL AND CHRISTINE, FOR CONVENIENCES SAKE) THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND RECENTLY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP. IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT CLOSE TO TEN YEARS AND I CONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP. RAOUL, IVE KNOWN FOR ALMOST AS LONG, BUT WE LIVE IN THE SAME CITY AND HANG OUT OCCASIONALLY. THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES.  DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST. ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN THOUGH RAOUL IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, I HAVE GOTTEN TO SEE A LOT OF HIS BAD SIDE (PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, SINCE I DONT TRUST MYSELF TO NOT BE BIASED), INCLUDING HIS (SEEMING) UNWILLINGNESS TO BE AFFECTIONATE EVEN IN A RELATIONSHIP HE INITIATES. IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL IN ONE OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER, THIS WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND RAOUL HAS SINCE CHANGED.
80	JAY MEACHAM (RIGHT) WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER, EVANGELINE NANCY MEACHAM, IN THIS UNDATED FAMILY PHOTO. JAY MEACHAM SAID HE WAS ABOUT 18 MONTHS OLD IN THE PHOTO. EVANGELINE MEACHAM, WHO JAY CALLED HIS "NANNY," DIED IN 1985. HE SAID HIS GRANDMOTHER SPOKE TO HIM IN ONONDAGA. ONONDAGA WAS HER FIRST LANGUAGE.PROVIDED PHOTO ONONDAGA NATION -- JAY MEACHAM CAN STILL HEAR HIS GRANDMOTHER SPEAK TO HIM IN THE ONONDAGA LANGUAGE. BUT EVANGELINE NANCY MEACHAM WAS RELUCTANT TO TEACH HER GRANDSON THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE SHE WAS TOLD NOT TO USE IT. EVANGELINE MEACHAM ATTENDED A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THE LATE 1930S AND WAS PUNISHED WHEN SHE FAILED TO USE ENGLISH. SHE WAS YELLED AT AND HIT WHEN SHE SPOKE IN ONONDAGA. ONE DAY IN CLASS SHE HAD TO USE THE BATHROOM, BUT HER FEAR TO ASK IN ONONDAGA AND HER INABILITY TO ASK IN ENGLISH CAUSED HER TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT. "HER PARENTS DECIDED THAT DAY THAT SHE WOULD LEARN ENGLISH AND ONLY SPEAK ENGLISH," JAY MEACHAM SAID. HIS GRANDMOTHER, WHO DIED IN 1985, RARELY SPOKE ONONDAGA AGAIN, BUT MANAGED TO RETAIN IT THE REST OF HER LIFE. EVANGELINE MEACHAM'S STORY IS FAMILIAR TO MANY ONONDAGAS WHO HAVE RELATIVES WHO WERE FORCED TO USE ENGLISH AT LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR AT BOARDING SCHOOLS DURING THE LATE 1800S AND EARLY 1900S. SOME ONONDAGA CHILDREN WERE SENT TO THE CARLISLE INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL IN PENNSYLVANIA IN THE LATE 1800S WHERE THE SCHOOL'S MOTTO WAS "KILL THE INDIAN, SAVE THE MAN." WHEN THE FIRST SCHOOL HOUSE OPENED ON THE BORDER OF THE ONONDAGA NATION IN 1850, CHILDREN SPEAKING ONONDAGA WERE DISCOURAGED AND EVEN PUNISHED AT SCHOOL. SOON MORE AND MORE YOUNG PEOPLE'S FIRST LANGUAGE TURNED TO ENGLISH. THE ONONDAGA NATION SIGN ON ROUTE 11.MICHAEL GREENLAR | MGREENLAR@SYRACUSE.COM THE RESULT WAS A GENERATION OF ONONDAGAS WHO STOPPED SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE AND SOME WHO REFUSED TO TEACH THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN THE LANGUAGE. THE EFFECTS ARE STILL FELT TODAY, SAID TADODAHO SIDNEY HILL, THE SPIRITUAL LEADER OF THE ONONDAGA NATION. "THERE IS A SHAME FELT BY THOSE WHO NEVER LEARNED THE LANGUAGE," HILL SAID. "IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT. WE WANT TO REMOVE THAT SHAME." ONONDAGA LEADERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE WORKING TO HELP REVITALIZE THE ONONDAGA LANGUAGE AND PRESERVE IT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. FOR THE ONONDAGA NATION, LANGUAGE IS THE KEY TO THE CULTURE'S SURVIVAL BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE IS USED IN ALL CEREMONIES, INCLUDING WEDDINGS AND FUNERALS. FLUENT SPEAKERS AND THOSE WHO KNOW THE CEREMONIES ARE CONSTANTLY IN DEMAND. THIS FALL, THE ONONDAGAS WILL START A TWO-YEAR LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAM. FIFTEEN ADULT ONONDAGAS WILL BE PAID BY THE NATION TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE FULL TIME. IN TURN, THEY MUST TEACH ANOTHER ONONDAGA THE LANGUAGE. THE IMMERSION PROGRAM IS AN EXPANSION OF OTHER LANGUAGE PROGRAMS OFFERED ON THE SOVEREIGN NATION LOCATED ON ABOUT 7,300 ACRES SOUTH OF SYRACUSE. CHILDREN START TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE AT THE ONONDAGA NATION SCHOOL. SOME TEENS ARE EXPOSED TO IT THROUGH THE NATION'S YOUTH GROUP, AND SOME ADULTS LEARN THE LANGUAGE THROUGH DISCUSSION GROUPS AND OTHER CLASSES. "WE WANT TO TEACH THE LANGUAGE TO EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO LEARN," SAID MEACHAM, WHO IS NOW A SUPERVISOR AT THE ONONDAGA NATION LANGUAGE CENTER. "WE WANT EVERYONE TO WANT TO LEARN." MEACHAM SAID HE WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE PEOPLE, LIKE HIS GRANDMOTHER, WHOSE FIRST LANGUAGE IS ONONDAGA. HE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ONONDAGA SPOKEN THROUGHOUT THE NATION. MEACHAM HAS TAUGHT DOZENS OF ONONDAGAS AND TRAINED SEVERAL TEACHERS AT THE LANGUAGE CENTER, WHICH IS NAMED NE' EHADIWENAYEDE'NHA' AND MEANS "THEY WILL GET TO KNOW THE LANGUAGE." THE CENTER OPENED IN 2010. BEFORE THE CENTER OPENED, MEACHAM SAID, HE AND OTHERS WERE TEACHING LANGUAGE CLASSES OUT OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS' HOMES. HILL SAID THE OPENING OF THE CENTER SHOWED THE COMMUNITY HOW IMPORTANT THE LANGUAGE IS TO THE NATION. IMMERSION PROGRAM THE CENTER HOLDS SEVERAL CLASSES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, BUT BEGINNING THIS MONTH THE CENTER WILL FOCUS ON THE NEW TWO-YEAR LANGUAGE IMMERSION. ONONDAGA NATION LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAM TEACHERS (FROM LEFT TO RIGHT) JAY MEACHAM, CHEECH HONYOUST, BROOKE VANDEWALKER, ANNIE SHENANDOAH AND KALLI THOMAS. MICHAEL GREENLAR | MGREENLAR@SYRACUSE.COM "OUR LANGUAGE SHOULD BE A BIG PART OF OUR EVERYDAY LIFE IF WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT," MEACHAM SAID. "WE NEED TO HEAR IT IN OUR STREETS, BUSINESSES, HOMES AND CARS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY." LANGUAGE CENTER TEACHERS WILL TEACH THE IMMERSION PROGRAM; MEACHEM HOPES MORE TEACHERS WILL COME OUT OF THE PROGRAM. CURRENTLY, THE CENTER HAS FIVE FULL-TIME TEACHERS AND ONE PART-TIME TEACHER: CHEECH HONYOUST, ZENJA HYDE, SHERRI WATERMAN-HOPPER, BROOKE VANDEWALKER, LORRIE ANNIE SHENANDOAH AND KALLI THOMAS. YOUTH PROGRAMS IN THE MID-1970S, THE ONONDAGA COUNCIL OF CHIEFS AND NATION MEMBERS DEMANDED CHANGE IN THE SCHOOL ON THE ONONDAGA NATION. THE CHANGE CAME. ONONDAGA LANGUAGE CLASSES AND CULTURE CLASSES BEGAN FOR ALL OF THE STUDENTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN-THROUGH-EIGHTH-GRADE SCHOOL. ONONDAGA NATION SCHOOL PRINCIPAL DIANE ELLSWORTH SAID THE LANGUAGE IS NOW EMBEDDED IN THE SCHOOL DAY, AND STUDENTS RECEIVE A LANGUAGE CLASS EVERY DAY. TWO YEARS AGO, IT WAS LENGTHENED FROM A HALF-HOUR TO A FULL-HOUR CLASS. THE SCHOOL WEEK INCLUDES AN OPENING CEREMONY EACH MONDAY AND A CLOSING CEREMONY EACH FRIDAY, BOTH SPOKEN IN ONONDAGA. AT EIGHTH-GRADE GRADUATION, THE STUDENTS MAKE THEIR OWN REGALIA IN HOME AND CAREERS CLASS AND GIVE THE OPENING AND CLOSING ADDRESSES IN ONONDAGA. "IT'S A TRADITION," ELLSWORTH SAID. "AND THE KIDS REALLY LOVE TO DO IT. IT SHOWS THE COMMUNITY THE RESPECT THE KIDS HAVE FOR THEIR LANGUAGE." ELLSWORTH SAID THE ONONDAGA LANGUAGE IS SEEN ON SIGNS AROUND THE SCHOOL AND FEATURED IN ART PROJECTS DISPLAYED ON THE WALLS. SOME TEACHERS ARE ALSO ONONDAGAS WHO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. THE SCHOOL POSTS AN ONONDAGA "WORD OF THE DAY" ON ITS ELECTRONIC SIGN IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL. CAROLINE TOUSE AND HER GRANDSON DREDIN THOMAS, 6, COUNT TO 10 IN THE ONONDAGA LANGUAGE. CAROLINE HAS BEEN LEARNING THE LANGUAGE FROM DREDIN WHO LEARNS ONONDAGA AT THE ONONDAGA NATION SCHOOL. MICHAEL GREENLAR | MGREENLAR@SYRACUSE.COM DREDIN THOMAS, 6, STARTED FIRST GRADE AT THE SCHOOL THIS MONTH. HE LEARNED MANY ONONDAGA WORDS IN KINDERGARTEN, ACCORDING TO HIS GRANDMOTHER, CAROLINE TOUSE. INSTEAD OF DREDIN LEARNING THE LANGUAGE FROM HIS GRANDMOTHER, HIS GRANDMOTHER IS LEARNING IT FROM HIM. IT'S A REVERSAL OF ROLES IN A CULTURE WHERE LANGUAGE AND CUSTOMS ARE TRADITIONALLY PASSED DOWN FROM GRANDPARENTS TO THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS. TOUSE, WHO GREW UP ON THE ONONDAGA NATION AND ATTENDS CEREMONIES AT THE LONGHOUSE, SAID SHE SPEAKS ONONDAGA AS MUCH AS SHE CAN, BUT IS EAGERLY LEARNING MORE FROM HER GRANDSON. TOUSE SAID SHE PRACTICES THE WORDS AND SAYINGS WITH DREDIN WHEN HE COMES HOME FROM SCHOOL. "WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE OUR LANGUAGE," SHE SAID. "I TELL HIM EVERY DAY THAT WE ARE SPECIAL PEOPLE AND THAT OUR LANGUAGE IS IMPORTANT." HUGH BURNAM, WHO SUPERVISES TEENAGERS IN THE ONONDAGA NATION YOUTH GROUP, WORKS TO SPREAD THE LANGUAGE TO THE YOUTH. BURNAM, WHO IS STUDYING THE LANGUAGE HIMSELF, SAYS HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE HE'S A TEACHER BUT RATHER A FACILITATOR OF THE LANGUAGE. "WE TALK ABOUT THE LANGUAGE," HE SAID. "THEY ARE ALL MY TEACHERS. WE LEARN TOGETHER." BURNAM SAID HE WORKS WITH THE TEENS ON GREETINGS, AND THE TEENS PRACTICE AND USE THE WORDS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. BURNAM SAID IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THE TEENS SPEAK TO EACH OTHER IN ONONDAGA AND HOPES THAT THEY CONTINUE TO LEARN. DANGERS OF EXTINCTION THE URGENCY TO PRESERVE THE ONONDAGA LANGUAGE IS A FAMILIAR SITUATION FOR MANY NATIVE AMERICAN NATIONS. OF ABOUT 165 INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES IN NORTH AMERICA, ABOUT HALF ARE SPOKEN BY A HANDFUL OF OLDER PEOPLE, ACCORDING TO STEPHEN R. ANDERSON OF THE LINGUISTIC SOCIETY OF AMERICA. ANDERSON SAID IT CAN BE ASSUMED THAT THOSE LANGUAGES ARE ON THEIR WAY TO EXTINCTION. ONLY EIGHT INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES IN NORTH AMERICAN ARE SPOKEN BY MORE THAN 10,000 PEOPLE, ANDERSON SAID IN HIS ARTICLE, "HOW MANY LANGUAGES ARE THERE IN THE WORLD?" THERE IS A PUSH IN CONGRESS TO PASS THE ESTHER MARTINEZ NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGES PRESERVATION ACT, A BILL RENEWING AND EXPANDING A FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAM. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HAS SPOKEN PUBLICLY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGES AND CULTURES. NOW IS THE TIME "THIS YEAR, THERE IS A REALLY BIG PUSH FOR LANGUAGE ON THE NATION," BURNAM SAID. BURNAM SAID THE PUSH COMES FROM A COMBINATION OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE RECENT DEATH OF SOME FLUENT SPEAKERS. "THERE IS A SENSE OF URGENCY, BUT IT'S A POSITIVE URGENCY," HE SAID. SUE PARSONS IS BURNAM'S LANGUAGE INSTRUCTOR. SHE SUPERVISES A SEPARATE ADULT LANGUAGE PROGRAM ON THE NATION AND SAID SHE FEELS NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME FOR ONONDAGAS TO EMBRACE THE LANGUAGE. SHE SAID MORE ONONDAGAS ARE IN A BETTER STATE OF MIND, GETTING BACK TO THEIR CULTURAL ROOTS. PARSONS SAID SHE GREW UP HEARING THE LANGUAGE AND SPEAKING WITH HER GREAT AUNTS WHO SPOKE THE LANGUAGE. SHE PREVIOUSLY TAUGHT PRESCHOOL ON THE NATION AND NOW LEADS DISCUSSION GROUPS WHERE ONONDAGAS CAN LEARN THE LANGUAGE AND DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CULTURE. "THE LANGUAGE IS THE CULTURE," SHE SAID. "THE CULTURE IS THE LANGUAGE." MEACHAM AGREES THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO SPREAD THE LANGUAGE AND TEACH IT TO EVERYONE ON THE NATION. "BABIES SHOULD HEAR OUR LANGUAGE FIRST," HE SAID. "WE SHOULD BE COMMUNICATING TO EACH OTHER IN ONONDAGA." MEACHAM SAID HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE IS DYING BECAUSE HE SEES SO MANY PEOPLE LEARNING. BUT HE DOES THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT IF MORE PEOPLE DON'T LEARN THE LANGUAGE IT COULD BE IN TROUBLE. WHEN A LANGUAGE IS ABOUT TO DIE, IT TURNS INTO A CEREMONIAL LANGUAGE, MEACHAM SAID. THIS MEANS IT GOES TO THE CHURCH OR TEMPLE OR LONGHOUSE TO DIE AND THE LANGUAGE IS NO LONGER SPOKEN OUTSIDE OF THE PLACE OF WORSHIP. THIS IS BECAUSE CEREMONIES ARE PREDICTABLE AND REPETITIOUS, HE SAID. "WE DON'T NEED SPEAKERS WHO CAN MEMORIZE CEREMONIES," MEACHAM SAID. "WE NEED SPEAKERS WHO CAN UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORDS MEAN." MEACHAM SAID NATIVE LANGUAGES ARE IN DIRE NEED FOR PEOPLE TO KEEP LEARNING AND TEACHING THEIR CHILDREN. "OUR NATIVE LANGUAGES ARE GOING EXTINCT BECAUSE THE INVADING LANGUAGE IS READILY AVAILABLE," HE SAID. "IT HAS BECOME EASIER TO JUST SPEAK ENGLISH THAN LEARN OUR OWN LANGUAGE. THIS PROCESS WAS SET INTO MOTION A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS AGO AND IT'S SUCCEEDING. WE NEED TO REVERSE IT." ONONDAGA CHILDREN WERE IMMERSED IN ENGLISH-ONLY CLASSROOMS TO LEARN ENGLISH. NOW ONONDAGAS ARE RETURNING TO THE CLASSROOM TO BE IMMERSED IN ONONDAGA. "WE'RE USING THEIR METHODS FOR OUR LANGUAGE," SAID HILL, THE ONONDAGA CHIEF. "THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO SAVE OUR LANGUAGE." SARAH MOSES COVERS THE NORTHERN SUBURBS OF ONONDAGA COUNTY AND OSWEGO COUNTY. CONTACT SARAH AT SMOSES@SYRACUSE.COM OR 470-2298.

82	FOOD AND DRINK ENTERTAINMENT ART & DESIGN PHOTO & VIDEO FOOD AND DRINK WASSHOI BEER SAKE AND SUMIBI POSTED BY TAM KENDI 15. SEP, 2015 /A ITS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT JAPANESE FOOD AND BEER ARE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN.ONE MAY EVEN SAY, WASSHOI!, AN EXCLAMATION OF EXCITEMENT OR CELEBRATION IN JAPANESE. A SAYING SIMILAR TO THE SPANISH HOLA. LUCKILY, THATS EXACTLY WHY JAPANESE RESTAURANT/BAR, WASSHOI BEER SAKE AND SUMIBI, HAS OPENED IN PRAHRAN MARKET PROVIDING A TANTALISING SELECTION OF GRILLED MEATS, SAKE AND BEER. RENOWNED CHEF IKUEI ARAKANE IS AT THE REIGNS OF THE 29 SEAT SUMIBIYAKI BAR. WELL KNOWN FOR HIS SPECTACULAR JAPANESE CUISINE AT KOKO RESTAURANT IN CROWN AND TAXI IN FEDERATION SQUARE. WHETHER GOING FOR A QUICK BITE TO EAT WITH FRIENDS, OR A FEW BEERS AND SNACKS AS THE WEATHER WARMS UP, WASSHOI IS CONVENIENTLY SITUATED IN PRAHRAN MARKET. THE PERFECT PLACE TO FEAST ON SOME TERIYAKI CHICKEN, OR PORK BELLY AFTER DOING THE SHOPPING. SUMIBIYAKI IS RELATIVELY RARE IN MELBOURNE, IN COMPARISON TO THE ABUNDANCE OF JAPANESE FOOD ON OFFER. DIFFERING TO YAKITORI, JAPANESE GRILLED MEAT ON SKEWERS, SUMIBIYAKI LITERALLY MEANS CHARCOAL GRILL IN JAPANESE. WHILE BOTH OFFER GRILLED MEAT, IT WOULD BE MORTALLY INSULTING TO CONFUSE THE TWO. SUMIBIYAKI BARS ARE A CURRENT TREND IN JAPAN AND FREQUENT FOR OFFICE WORKERS AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, WHERE CHUGGING DOWN A COLD GLASS OF BEER IS RUDIMENTARY. WASSHOI OFFERS ONE OF JAPANS MOST POPULAR BEERS, KIRIN, WHICH IS AVAILABLE CHILLED AND ON TAP.

83	CANADIAN OIL PRODUCERS HAVE REALLY TAKEN THE OIL DOWNTURN ON THE CHIN. DUE TO A COMBINATION OF RISING U.S. OIL PRODUCTION, PIPELINE CONSTRAINTS, AND REFINERY OUTAGES IN THE U.S., THE PRICE FOR CANADIAN CRUDE IS SELLING FOR A HUGE DISCOUNT TO OIL PRODUCED ELSEWHERE. THATS HAVING AN EVEN DEEPER IMPACT ON THE CASH FLOW OF CANADIAN PRODUCERS, WHICH IS WHY CENOVUS ENERGY INC. (TSX:CVE) (NYSE:CVE) IS LOOKING FOR MORE LUCRATIVE MARKETS FOR ITS OIL OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA. REALLY CHEAP OIL THE PRICE OF THE GLOBAL CRUDE OIL BENCHMARK, BRENT, HAS BEEN CUT IN HALF OVER THE PAST YEAR, DOWN FROM AROUND $100 PER BARREL TO LESS THAN $50 IN RECENT WEEKS. HOWEVER, THE PRICE OF CANADIAN CRUDE WAS SELLING FOR AS LITTLE AS $20 PER BARREL LAST MONTH. FEW OIL COMPANIES IN CANADA CAN ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY SELLING OIL AT THAT PRICE. THE REASON CANADIAN CRUDE IS SO CHEAP IS BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS GETTING IT SHIPPED AND REFINED BY ITS PRIMARY CUSTOMERS, WHICH ARE U.S. REFINERS. THERE SIMPLY ISNT ENOUGH PIPELINE CAPACITY TO GET CANADIAN OIL INTO THE U.S., ESPECIALLY WITH MAJOR EXPORT PIPELINES LIKE THE KEYSTONE XL FROM TRANSCANADA STILL DELAYED. MAKING MATTERS WORSE, NOT ALL U.S. REFINERIES CAN HANDLE THE HEAVY OIL PRODUCED OUT OF THE OIL SANDS, SO WHEN ONE GOES OFFLINE IT LEADS TO A GLUT OF OIL AND REALLY WEAK PRICES. SEEKING A BETTER PRICE BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WITH PRICE REALIZATIONS, CENOVUS ENERGY HAS FOCUSED A LOT OF ATTENTION THIS YEAR ON IMPROVING ITS MARKET FLEXIBILITY. THE COMPANY HAS DONE A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT THINGS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ITS PRICE REALIZATIONS. THE FIRST THING THAT CENOVUS DID WAS TO ACQUIRE A CRUDE-BY-RAIL TERMINAL. THE COMPANY SPENT $75 MILLION TO ACQUIRE A TERMINAL THAT CAN MOVE 70,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE PER DAY. THIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO BYPASS THE PIPELINE CONGESTION TO GET ITS OIL TO REFINERIES IN THE U.S. MUCH QUICKER. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE COMPANY HAS ALSO RECEIVED AN EXPORT LICENSE TO EXPORT ITS OIL FROM THE UNITED STATES. THIS WILL ENABLE THE COMPANY TO GET A HIGHER PRICE FOR ITS OIL AS IT CAN SELL IT AT THE GLOBAL CRUDE BENCHMARK PRICE INSTEAD OF THE DISCOUNTED NORTH AMERICAN BENCHMARK PRICES. OF COURSE, CENOVUS ENERGY IS NO STRANGER TO EXPORTING OIL OVERSEAS AS IT ALREADY DOES EXPORT OIL VIA KINDER MORGANS TRANS MOUNTAIN PIPELINE. HOWEVER,IT NOW HAS THE OPTION OF EXPORTING OIL FROM THE U.S. GULF COAST AS WELL, WHICH INCREASES ITS FLEXIBILITY, SO IT CAN GET THE BEST POSSIBLE MARKET PRICE FOR ITS OIL. INVESTOR TAKEAWAY BY INCREASING ITS MARKET FLEXIBILITY, CENOVUS ENERGY IS ABLE TO GET A MUCH BETTER PRICE FOR ITS OIL. GIVEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPOT PRICE OF OIL IN CANADA AND THE PRICE OF THE GLOBAL OIL BENCHMARK, THIS IS A REALLY SMART MOVE FOR THE COMPANY. WHILE OIL EXPORTS WONT CURE ALL OF CENOVUSS AILS, IT WILL CERTAINLY HELP THE COMPANY MAKE MORE MONEY THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE, AND MORE THAN WHAT ITS LANDLOCKED CANADIAN PEERS ARE EARNINGS. OUR TOP TURNAROUND STOCK FOR 2015 CENOVUS ENERGY IS HOPING OIL EXPORTS WILL TURN AROUND ITS SAGGING PROFITS. HOWEVER, TURNAROUNDS ARE TOUGH TO ENGINEER. IN FACT, WHEN TECH COMPANIES FALL FROM GRACE LIKE THIS CANADIAN ICON DID, IT'S TYPICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REGAIN RELEVANCE. HERE AT MOTLEY FOOL CANADA, WE THINK THIS COMPANY AND ITS CEO ARE PREPARED TO PROVE ALL OF THE DOUBTERS WRONG. WE HAVE EVEN NAMED IT ONE TOP TURNAROUND STOCK FOR 2015.

84	CARLY FIORINA SHOT INTO SECOND PLACE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL FIELD ON THE HEELS OF ANOTHER STRONG DEBATE PERFORMANCE, AND DONALD TRUMP HAS LOST SOME SUPPORT, A NEW NATIONAL CNN/ORC POLL SHOWS. THE SURVEY, CONDUCTED IN THE THREE DAYS AFTER 23 MILLION PEOPLE TUNED IN TO WEDNESDAY NIGHT'S GOP DEBATE ON CNN, SHOWS THAT TRUMP IS STILL THE PARTY'S FRONT-RUNNER WITH 24% SUPPORT. THAT, THOUGH, IS AN 8 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE FROM EARLIER IN THE MONTH WHEN A SIMILAR POLL HAD HIM AT 32%. FIORINA RANKS SECOND WITH 15% SUPPORT -- UP FROM 3% IN EARLY SEPTEMBER. SHE'S JUST AHEAD OF BEN CARSON'S 14%, THOUGH CARSON'S SUPPORT HAS ALSO DECLINED FROM 19% IN THE PREVIOUS POLL. DRIVING TRUMP'S DROP AND FIORINA'S RISE: A DEBATE IN WHICH 31% OF REPUBLICANS WHO WATCHED SAID TRUMP WAS THE LOSER, AND 52% IDENTIFIED FIORINA AS THE WINNER. DURING THE CNN DEBATE, FIORINA CLASHED WITH TRUMP OVER HIS PERSONAL ATTACKS AND THEIR BUSINESS RECORDS AND SCORED POINTS FOR HER CONDEMNATION OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THE TOP THREE CONTENDERS UNDERSCORE A KEY THEME IN THE 2016 RACE: IN A JAMPACKED GOP PRESIDENTIAL FIELD, THE LEADING CANDIDATES ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE NEVER HELD POLITICAL OFFICE. BUT ONE ESTABLISHED POLITICIAN HAS SEEN HIS STANDING RISE AFTER FLASHING FOREIGN POLICY CHOPS ON THE DEBATE STAGE. SEN. MARCO RUBIO OF FLORIDA -- IDENTIFIED AS WEDNESDAY'S WINNER BY 14% OF REPUBLICANS, PUTTING HIM SECOND BEHIND FIORINA -- IS NOW IN FOURTH PLACE WITH 11% SUPPORT, UP FROM 3% IN A PREVIOUS POLL. IN FIFTH PLACE IS FORMER FLORIDA GOV. JEB BUSH, AT 9%. HE'S FOLLOWED BY SEN. TED CRUZ OF TEXAS AND FORMER ARKANSAS GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE AT 6% EACH, SEN. RAND PAUL OF KENTUCKY AT 4%, NEW JERSEY GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE AT 3%, OHIO GOV. JOHN KASICH AT 2% AND FORMER SEN. RICK SANTORUM OF PENNSYLVANIA AT 1%. FIVE OTHER CANDIDATES RECEIVED LESS THAN ONE-HALF OF 1 PERCENTAGE POINT SUPPORT: FORMER VIRGINIA GOV. JIM GILMORE, SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA, LOUISIANA GOV. BOBBY JINDAL, FORMER NEW YORK GOV. GEORGE PATAKI AND WISCONSIN GOV. SCOTT WALKER. WALKER'S COLLAPSE IS ESPECIALLY STARK. CELEBRATED BY CONSERVATIVES -- IN THE PARTY'S BASE AND ITS DONOR CLASS ALIKE -- FOR HIS UNION-BUSTING EFFORTS IN WISCONSIN, WALKER AT ONE POINT LED THE FIELD IN THE KEY EARLY VOTING STATE OF IOWA. HIS SUPPORT HAD ALREADY DROPPED TO 5% IN A CNN/ORC POLL IN EARLY SEPTEMBER, BUT THE BOTTOM APPEARS TO HAVE FALLEN OUT COMPLETELY SINCE THEN -- WITH A SECOND FLAT DEBATE PERFORMANCE COMING AFTER CRITICISM OF HIS DISPARATE ANSWERS ON ISSUES LIKE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP. CARSON WAS A QUIET PRESENCE IN WEDNESDAY'S DEBATE, BUT HE REMAINS THE MOST POPULAR CANDIDATE IN THE GOP FIELD, WITH 65% OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS SAYING THEY VIEW HIM FAVORABLY, COMPARED WITH JUST 10% SAYING THEY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE OPINION OF THE RETIRED NEUROSURGEON. RUBIO RANKS SECOND IN THE POPULARITY CONTEST, WITH 57% VIEWING HIM FAVORABLY AND 16% UNFAVORABLY. HE'S FOLLOWED BY FIORINA (54% FAVORABLE TO 17% UNFAVORABLE), HUCKABEE (53% TO 28% UNFAVORABLE), CRUZ (52% TO 22%) AND TRUMP (52% TO 40%). THE BIGGEST POSITIVE MOVEMENT WAS IN FAVOR OF FIORINA, WHOSE FAVORABILITY RATING HAS CLIMBED BY 9 PERCENTAGE POINTS SINCE AUGUST. AND THE BIGGEST DROP HIT TRUMP, WHO SHED 6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THAT SAME PERIOD. BUT TRUMP STILL STANDS OUT ON THE ISSUES. ABOUT 44% OF LIKELY GOP VOTERS SAY THEY SEE TRUMP AS THE CANDIDATE WHO COULD BEST HANDLE THE ECONOMY -- WELL AHEAD OF HIS NEAREST COMPETITORS: FIORINA AT 11%, RUBIO AT 10% AND BUSH AT 8%. TRUMP ALSO WINS ON IMMIGRATION, WITH 47% SAYING HE COULD BEST ADDRESS THE ISSUE, AHEAD OF SECOND-PLACE RUBIO'S 15% AND BUSH'S 9%. HE EVEN EDGES RUBIO, 22% TO 17%, ON WHO COULD BEST HANDLE FOREIGN POLICY. THE POLL OFFERED SOME GOOD OVERALL NEWS FOR REPUBLICANS: 65% OF GOP VOTERS SAID THEY ARE EITHER "EXTREMELY" OR "VERY" ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT VOTING IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RACE, COMPARED WITH 51% OF DEMOCRATS. THE CNN/ORC POLL WAS CONDUCTED SEPTEMBER 17-19 AND SURVEYED 1,006 ADULT AMERICANS, INCLUDING 924 REGISTERED VOTERS -- 444 OF WHOM ARE REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO LEAN TOWARD THE GOP. THE MARGIN OF ERROR WITH THE REPUBLICAN RESULTS IS PLUS OR MINUS 4.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS.
85	CREDIT: THINKSTOCK ( THIS ARTICLE APPEARED PREVIOUSLY ON MARKETWATCH. ) JUST WHEN I THINK IVE HEARD EVERY BAD REASON FOR TAKING SOCIAL SECURITY EARLY, ANOTHER ONE POPS UP. UNDERSTAND THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO TAKE SOCIAL SECURITY EARLY. BUT BAD REASONS ARENT SUPPORTED BY THE FACTS. HERE ARE THE TOP FIVE BAD REASONS: 1. ILL GET MORE MONEY BY TAKING IT EARLY. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO BET ON DYING YOUNG? DO THE MATH. TAKE SOCIAL SECURITY AT 66 INSTEAD OF 62, AND YOURE MONEY AHEAD BY AGE 78. TAKE IT AT 70 AND YOURE AHEAD BY 82 1/2 BEFORE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY. MARRIED? DELAYING SOCIAL SECURITY CAN MEAN MORE MONEY FOR THE LONGER-LIVING SPOUSE TOO. FACT-BASED APPROACH: SEE IF FILING EARLY PAYS. ESTIMATE YOUR LIFE EXPECTANCY AT SITES LIKE LIVING TO 100AND BLUE ZONES, OR VIEW AVERAGES ON A TABLE. ESTIMATE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENT FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (SSA) AT SSAS WEBSITE. MOREFOR RETIREMENT PLANNING, GET THE SPIRIT OF 76 COMPUTE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF YOUR FIRST FEW YEARS OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND CONSIDER SETTING ASIDE THAT CASH TO REPLACE THOSE EARLY PAYMENTS. 2. MY FRIEND DIED BEFORE HE GOT SOCIAL SECURITY. AFTER PAYING FOR DECADES, THE IDEA OF GETTING NOTHING IS GALLING. BUT THINK ABOUT THIS PAINFUL FACT: AN EARLY DEATH MEANS YOU NO LONGER NEED LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLANNING. ACTUARY AND AUTHOR STEVE VERNON SUGGESTS YOUR BIGGER PROBLEM IS A LATE DEATH, WITH THE NEED TO FUND A LONG LIFE. FACT-BASED APPROACH: REMEMBER THAT, ON AVERAGE, YOU AND YOUR SPOUSE GET MORE SOCIAL SECURITY BY DELAYING (SEE BAD REASON #1). SOCIAL SECURITY IS EXCELLENT LONGEVITY PROTECTION, SO DONT SETTLE FOR A SMALLER EARLY PAYMENT. 3. I CANT STAND MY JOB. UNDERSTOOD. SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO LEAVE, EVEN IF IT COSTS. BUT IT DOESNT FOLLOW THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE SOCIAL SECURITY NOW UNLESS YOU REALLY NEED THE MONEY. FACT-BASED APPROACH: PLAN YOUR LANDING BEFORE YOU BAIL OUT. THINK ABOUT ALTERNATIVES TO TAKING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY EARLY. A FUN PART-TIME JOB WILL PAY BETTER. DRAWING DOWN YOUR SAVINGS MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE. TALK TO A FEE-BASED FINANCIAL PLANNER. THE SOCIAL SECURITY IS THERE IF YOU NEED IT, BUT ITS NOT THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO YOUR YUCKY JOB. 4. I DONT WANT TO SPEND DOWN MY SAVINGS. YES, ITS REALLY HARD TO START SPENDING YOUR NEST EGG. BUT IN SOME CASES, IT MAKES GOOD SENSE. COMPUTE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF YOUR FIRST FEW YEARS OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND CONSIDER SETTING ASIDE CASH TO REPLACE THOSE EARLY PAYMENTS. YOU COULD COME OUT AHEAD IN THE LONG RUN. MOREHOW TO GENERATE RETIREMENT INCOME FROM SAVINGS CONSIDER TAXES, TOO: IF YOURE BLESSED WITH A LARGE TRADITIONAL INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA), THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE WILL FORCE REQUIRED MINIMUM WITHDRAWALS (RMDS) AT 70 1/2, AS YOU CAN SEE HERE. THE LARGER YOUR IRA, THE BIGGER THE WITHDRAWALS AND THE TAX BITE. BY CONTRAST, IF YOU PARTIALLY DRAW DOWN YOUR IRA EARLY AND DELAY SOCIAL SECURITY UNTIL 70, YOUR FORCED WITHDRAWALS WILL BE LOWER, AND YOUR RELATIVELY HIGHER SOCIAL SECURITY IS TAX ADVANTAGED. FACT-BASED APPROACH: LOOK AT YOUR SAVINGS VS. YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENT AND CONSIDER CREATING A REPLACEMENT FUND. TALK TO A FINANCIAL PLANNER OR TAX PROFESSIONAL ABOUT EARLY VS. LATE IRA WITHDRAWALS. 5. SOCIAL SECURITY IS GOING BROKE. YOURE THINKING SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT ANY DAY NOW, AND YOU WANT TO GET YOURS BEFORE THE MONEYS GONE. THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS WITH THIS. FIRST, SOCIAL SECURITY ISNT BROKE. THE LATEST ACCOUNTING SHOWS ITS 100PERCENTSOLVENT UNTIL 2034. NOT EXACTLY AN IMMINENT TRAIN WRECK. AND AFTER 2034, IT COULD CONTINUE TO PAY 79PERCENTOF BENEFITS, NOT A BANKRUPT ZERO. THAT ASSUMES NO FIX BEFORE THEN. SECOND, EVERY PROPOSED FIX GIVES OLDER PEOPLE A BREAK, BY FOCUSING TAX INCREASES OR BENEFIT CUTS ON YOUNGER GENERATIONS. IF YOURE ALREADY SOCIAL SECURITY AGE, THERES NO BIG RUSH. FACT-BASED APPROACH: LEARN ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITYS SOLVENCY. AND CONSIDER: WOULD CONGRESS LET THE MOST POPULAR PROGRAM IN HISTORY DIE? NATURALLY THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO TAKE SOCIAL SECURITY EARLY: SHORT LIFE EXPECTANCY, NEEDING THE MONEY TO MAKE ENDS MEET, EXERCISING A ZOMBIE STRATEGY, AND MORE. JUST DONT TAKE IT FOR A BAD REASON. AND AS ALWAYS, KEEP ON PLANNING. THIS ARTICLE IS REPRINTED WITH PERMISSION FROM MARKETWATCH.COM. 2015 DOW, JONES & CO., INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

86	ON AUG 31, WE ISSUED AN UPDATED RESEARCH REPORT ON PAINTS AND COATINGS MAKER VALSPAR ( VAL - ANALYST REPORT ). VALSPAR SAW HIGHER PROFITS IN THIRD-QUARTER FISCAL 2015 (ENDED JUL 31, 2015) ON THE BACK OF SOLID COMMERCIAL EXECUTION AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER SURPASSED THE ZACKS CONSENSUS ESTIMATE WHILE REVENUES LAGGED THE SAME. THE COMPANY RAISED THE LOWER END OF ITS EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2015. VALSPAR HAS A BROAD PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHARE GAINS IN BOTH ITS PAINTS AND COATINGS SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY SHOULD CONTINUE TO GAIN FROM NEW BUSINESS WINS, INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH INITIATIVES AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS. WINNING NEW BUSINESSES REMAIN A COMPANY-WIDE FOCUS THAT WILL POSITION VALSPAR WELL FOR THE FUTURE. THE ACQUISITION OF PAINT MANUFACTURING ASSETS OF ACE HARDWARE HAS REINFORCED VALSPAR RETAIL FOOTHOLD IN THE U.S. MOREOVER, VALSPAR HAS STRENGTHENED ITS POSITION IN THE $6 BILLION EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MARKET WITH THE TAKEOVER OF ITALY-BASED INDUSTRIAL COATINGS MAKER INVER HOLDING S.R.L. THE PURCHASE OF QUEST SPECIALTY CHEMICALS PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESSES HAS ALSO STRENGTHENS VALSPAR'S FOOTHOLD IN THE ATTRACTIVE AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH MARKET. THE COMPANY IS LOOKING TO BOOST SALES WITH THE INTEGRATION OF QUEST CHEMICALS. THE ACQUISITION ADDED 6% TO PAINTS SEGMENTS SALES IN THE THIRD QUARTER. IN ADDITION, VALSPARS PAINT BUSINESS IS ALSO BENEFITING FROM CONTINUED ROLLOUT OF VALSPAR BRANDED PRODUCTS AT ACE HARDWARE. MOREOVER, VALSPAR RESERVE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR PAINTS ARE ALSO DRIVING SALES IN THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CHANNEL. VALSPAR IS AGGRESSIVELY INVESTING IN PROMOTING THIS PRODUCT. VALSPAR IS ALSO MANAGING ITS COST WELL AND MAINTAINING A COST STRUCTURE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CURRENT EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. IT ALSO REMAINS COMMITTED TO BOOST SHAREHOLDER RETURN LEVERAGING HEALTHY CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, VALSPAR FACES CURRENCY HEADWINDS, STEMMING FROM A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR. UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY SWINGS REDUCED ITS SALES BY 5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER. CURRENCY HEADWIND IS EXPECTED WEIGH ON ITS SALES FOR FISCAL 2015. THE COMPANY NOW SEES ITS REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2015 TO FALL IN THE MID SINGLE-DIGITS YEAR OVER YEAR VERSUS A LOW SINGLE-DIGITS DECLINE EXPECTED EARLIER. WE ALSO ACCOUNT FOR VOLATILITY IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS. VALSPAR HAS EXPERIENCED DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLIES OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS AT VARIOUS TIMES, IMPACTING ITS ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS. THE OVERALL DEMAND ENVIRONMENT ALSO REMAINS UNEVEN. VALSPAR CURRENTLY SPORTS A ZACKS RANK #3 (HOLD). OTHER STOCKS TO CONSIDER OTHER COMPANIES IN THE BASIC MATERIALS SPACE WORTH CONSIDERING INCLUDE INNOSPEC INC. ( IOSP - SNAPSHOT REPORT ), AIR PRODUCTS & CHEMICALS INC. ( APD - ANALYST REPORT ) AND LYONDELLBASELL INDUSTRIES N.V. ( LYB - ANALYST REPORT ). WHILE INNOSPEC RETAINS A ZACKS RANK #1 (STRONG BUY), BOTH AIR PRODUCTS AND LYONDELLBASELL HOLD A ZACKS RANK #2 (BUY). WANT THE LATEST RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ZACKS INVESTMENT RESEARCH?

THE GRANDPARENTS WHOSE SHOULDERS WERE A SAFE HAVEN TO CRY ON WITH NO JUDGEMENT LIVING AMONGST THIS RELATIONSHIP. ON AND ON, ONE BY ONE, YOU COULD PINPOINT THE SIGNIFICANCE EVERY HEART IN THE ROOM HAD ON THIS NEWLY FORMED FAMILY. I WATCHED AS THE NEWEST BRIDE AND GROOM DANCED THEIR FIRST DANCE. ONCE THE SONG CONCLUDED AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT ALL MARRIED COUPLES MUST REPORT TO THE DANCE FLOOR FOR A VERY SPECIAL TRIBUTE. AFTER A LITTLE COAXING, EVERYONE FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE DANCE FLOOR. MUSIC BEGAN AND THE DANCING STARTED. A FEW MOMENTS PASSED AND A REQUEST WAS MADE THAT EVERYONE MARRIED FOR LESS THAN A YEAR TO PLEASE EXIT THE FLOOR AND FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO THEIR TABLES. THE MUSIC CONTINUED TO PLAY AND SLOWLY WITH EACH NEW REQUEST FEWER COUPLES REMAINED. FINALLY ONE COUPLE WAS LEFT STANDING, HOLDING ON TO EACH OTHER AND GAZING INTO EACH OTHERS EYES. THEY NO LONGER RESEMBLED THE TWO YOUNG KIDS WHO WERE MARRIED AT EIGHTEEN. TIME HAD MARCHED ON AND AGING CREPT ITS WAY ACROSS THEIR YOUNG FACES. BODIES WERE WAR TORN FROM LONG AGO BATTLES AND CHILDREN BLESSED THEIR LIVES BUT TOOK A TOLL ON THEIR AGING HEARTS. THE FLUIDITY OF THE BOXTROT COULD NOT BE FOUND AND A GENTLE SWAY WAS WITNESSED AS THEY EACH SECRETLY HELD THE OTHER UP. EVEN AFTER ALL THE YEARS HAD PASSED THE FACES THEY GAZED UPON WERE THE MOST FAMILIAR OF ALL. EVERY WRINKLE THAT FOUND ITS HOME FOUND A PLACE IN THE OTHERS HEART. EVERY PART OF THEM HAD BEEN DETAILED IN A FINE MAP TUCKED IN THE RECESS OF THEIR MEMORIES.. HERE IS WHERE THEY WERE AND HERE IS WHERE THEY WOULD ALWAYS BE. THEY LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE AGE DOES NOT TOUCH THEIR LOVE. IT IS CEMENTED INTO THEIR HISTORY AND HAS BEEN THE FOUNDATION FOR THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES. RECENTLY MARRIED I AM INFANT IN THE MARRIAGE WORLD. WE CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THE NEWLYWED BLISS OF EVERYDAY LIFE. FIGHTS ERUPT BUT THE COMFORT OF KNOWING THE OTHER WILL ALWAYS BE THERE HAS GIVEN WAY TO NEW FORMS OF COMMUNICATION. EVERYDAY IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND ALSO CONTAINS SOME OF THE MOST REWARDING OF MOMENTS. IT IS A COMRADERY OF THE TWO OF US AGAINST THE WORLD WHICH RESULTS IN A FEELING OF BEING LARGER THAN LIFE ITSELF. IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYDAY LIFE WE SEARCHED AND FOUND A LIFE LONG COMPANION THAT NEVER LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF LOVE GIVEN IN A SINGLE MOMENT. LUPUS AND INFERTILITY DOES NOT HOLD BACK THIS LOVE BUT NURTURES IT AND TEACHES US PERSONAL HUMILITY, GRACE AND WONDER IN THE SIMPLE MOMENTS OF LIFE. I HAVE TAKEN AWAY IN THE BRIEF TIME I HAVE BEEN MARRIED A KNOWLEDGE THAT I ALWAYS KNEW BUT NEVER EXPERIENCED. LOVE IS AN EVER CHANGING HORIZON WE EACH LOOK OUT UPON IN OUR LIVES. CLOUDS ROLL IN, STORMS DROP RAIN AND AS THE SUN PEAKS BACK OUT ANOTHER LAYER HAS BEEN WASHED AWAY AND EXPOSED LEAVING A NEW LAYER OF LOVE TO BE NOURISHED. THIS NEW LAYER IS ENRICHED BY ITS SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT AND GROWS WILD UNDER THE SUN. TIME PASSES AND LAYER AFTER LAYER IS ADDED AND A TRUE LOVE STORY IS CREATED. ONE THAT IS CARRIED ON FOR GENERATIONS TO COME AND SETS AN EXAMPLE FOR ALL OF US TO DANCE TO. HTTP://WWW.FAIRHAVENHEALTH.COM/
91	BALLACHULISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL SECRETARY DAVE KITSON OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE'S RBS BRANCH. PICTURE: IAIN FERGUSON, THE WRITE IMAGE A LOCHABER COMMUNITY IS FIGHTING TO SAVE ITS LOCAL BANKING SERVICE AFTER LEARNING THAT ITS BRANCH IS TO CLOSE AND BE REPLACED WITH A MOBILE BANK. PEOPLE LIVING IN THE BALLACHULISH AREA WERE SHOCKED AND DISAPPOINTED TO DISCOVER THAT RBS WAS PLANNING TO CLOSE ITS BRANCH IN THE VILLAGE. THE MOVE FOLLOWS THE CLOSURE OF THE RBS BRANCH IN KINLOCHLEVEN IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, WHICH WAS ALSO OPPOSED BY LOCALS. BOTH CLOSURES HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO FALLING CUSTOMER NUMBERS DUE TO MORE PEOPLE USING ONLINE AND MOBILE BANKING. THE BANK SAID THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AT THE BALLACHULISH BRANCH HAD DROPPED BY 26 PER CENT SINCE 2011, WITH ONLY 19 CUSTOMERS USING THE BRANCH ON A REGULAR WEEKLY BASIS. A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE BANK SAID: WE HAVE TAKEN THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO CLOSE THE RBS BALLACHULISH BRANCH ON DECEMBER 7, 2015. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO ENSURE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE WAYS FOR PEOPLE IN THE AREA TO CONTINUE TO BANK WITH US. SHE ADDED THAT THEY WOULD BE INTRODUCING A MOBILE BRANCH SERVICE AND CUSTOMERS WOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT TRANSACTIONS AT THE LOCAL POST OFFICE. THE SPOKESWOMAN ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE FORT WILLIAM BRANCH AND EIGHT FREE TO USE ATMS WERE WITHIN 15 MILES OF BALLACHULISH. BALLACHULISH COMMUNITY COUNCIL CHAIRMAN KEVIN SMITH SAID LOCALS WERE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE PROPOSED CLOSURE. AND HE HAS WRITTEN TO THE BANK POINTING OUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THE KINLOCHLEVEN COMMUNITY HAS EXPERIENCED SINCE ITS BRANCH CLOSED, INCLUDING DELAYS IN CREDIT AND DEBIT PAYMENTS AND THE RESULTING CHARGES. HE ADDED THAT THE FIGURES GIVEN FOR CUSTOMER USAGE AT THE BALLACHULISH BRANCH WERE SO LOW THAT THEY WERE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE. MR SMITH WROTE: YOU ARE SAYING THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH FOOTFALL IN THE BANK, BUT AT ANYTIME I AM IN THERE IS A QUEUE. AND HE HAS ASKED THE BANK TO RESPOND TO A SERIES OF QUESTIONS INCLUDING HOW MANY CUSTOMERS RBS HAS IN THE BALLACHULISH AREA INCLUDING THOSE IN KINLOCHLEVEN, DUROR AND NETHER LOCHABER. MR SMITH ALSO WANTS TO KNOW WHETHER THE MOBILE SERVICE WOULD CONTINUE THE CURRENT HOURS ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY MORNINGS, WHAT ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE MADE FOR QUEUING, ESPECIALLY IN BAD WEATHER, AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A PRIVATE ROOM FOR CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH TELLERS. FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES REGIONAL CHAIRWOMAN FOR THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS AMANDA FRAZER SAID: WHILE AROUND 75 PER CENT OF HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS MEMBERS DO NOW BANK ONLINE, BRANCHES REMAIN VITAL, WITH 64 PER CENT OF MEMBERS USING THEM FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY USE THEM FOR DEPOSITING CASH, BUT FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS AND CASH WITHDRAWALS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT.
92	ITS EASY TO BE FEARLESS WHEN YOU HAVE A GOOD SHELL BY ELIZABETH PRESTON | SEPTEMBER 4, 2015 10:57 AM AESOP NEVER PENNED A FABLEABOUT A SNAIL. IF HE HAD WRITTEN ABOUT A CERTAIN FRESHWATER MOLLUSK, THE MORAL MIGHTHAVE BEEN BOLDNESS COMES FROM A STRONG SHELLOR MAYBECARELESS SNAILS GET CHOMPED.BUT BECAUSE THE SNAIL AND ITS VARIABLESHELL ARE REAL, THEIR LESSON HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE THE WEIRD WORKINGS OF EVOLUTION. INDIVIDUAL RADIX BALTHICASNAILS CAN HAVE DIFFERENTLY SHAPED SHELLS. THEY ALSO HAVE VARYING PERSONALITIES, AT LEAST AS FAR AS YOU CAN MEASURE SUCH A THING IN A MOLLUSK. TO SEE WHETHERTHEIR SHELLS AND PERSONALITIES WERE LINKED, JOHAN AHLGREN, A RESEARCHERAT LUND UNIVERSITY IN SWEDEN, GATHERED SNAIL EGGS FROM FOUR NEARBY PONDS. BACK IN THE LAB, ALBERG WAITED FOR THE EGGS TO HATCH. HEFED THE YOUNG SNAILS ALGAE AND LETTUCE UNTIL THEY WERE GROWN. THEN HESUBJECTED THE ANIMALSTO A PERSONALITY TEST. THE TRAIT THAT INTERESTED AHLBERG AND HIS COLLEAGUES WAS BOLDNESS. MEASURINGAN ANIMALS BOLDNESS OR SHYNESS IS A COMMON WAY TOSTUDY PERSONALITY IN SPECIES ALL ACROSS THE ANIMAL KINGDOM: DOES ITREADILY EXPLORE A NEW SPACE? DOES IT STAND FROZEN IN A CORNER? IN SNAILS, SHYNESS MEANS STAYING INSIDE YOUR SHELL. SO AHLBERG GENTLY PRODDED THE SNAILS SHELLS WITH TWEEZERS TO FRIGHTEN THEM (THE SNAILS RETRACTED AFTER ONE POKE, THE SCIENTISTSWRITE). THEN HECOUNTED THE SECONDS UNTIL THE ANIMALSSTUCK THEIR HEADS BACK OUT. AFTER REPEATING THE EXPERIMENT A WEEK LATER, AHLBERG COULD SORT THE SNAILS INTO TWO GROUPS. BOLD SNAILS CONSISTENTLY EMERGED FROMTHEIR SHELLS IN UNDER 10 SECONDS. SHY SNAILS TOOK 15 SECONDS OR LONGER. SOME ESPECIALLY TIMID INDIVIDUALS WAITED THREE OR FOUR MINUTES BEFORE DARING TO POKE THEIR ANTENNAE OUT. NEXT,AHLBERG SCANNED THE SHELLS OF ALL THE SNAILS AND ANALYZED THEIR SHAPES. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES, HE DISCOVERED, BETWEEN THE SHELLS OF BOLD AND SHY SNAILS. BOLD INDIVIDUALSHAD ROUNDER SHELLS WITH WIDER OPENINGS. SHY ONESHAD MORE ELONGATED SHELLS WITH NARROWEROPENINGS. BOLD R. BALTHICA SNAILS HAVE ROUNDER SHELLS, LIKE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT. SHELLS THAT ARE ROUND WITHWIDE OPENINGS ARE HARDER FOR FISH TO CRUSH AND EAT, THE AUTHORS WRITE. SO BOLDER SNAILS HAVE SAFER SHELLS. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY CAN AFFORD TO BE BOLD, BECAUSE THEY HAVE BETTER PROTECTION FROM PREDATORS. LINKS BETWEEN PERSONALITY AND BODY TYPE HAVE SHOWN UP IN OTHER ANIMALS. BOLDER ANOLE LIZARDS HAVE TAILS THAT BREAK OFF MORE EASILY, FOR EXAMPLE. AS IN THE SNAILS, ANIMALS WITH AMORE FEARLESS PERSONALITY SEEM TO BALANCE THAT TRAIT WITH A BODY THATS SAFER FROM PREDATORS. DO THE SNAILS LEARN TO BE BOLD BECAUSE THEY GROW UP WITH STURDIER SHELLS? ALTHOUGH THIS IS POSSIBLE, THE AUTHORS WRITE, IN THIS EXPERIMENT ALL THE SNAILS GREW UP IN THE LAB, SAFE FROM PREDATORS. THEIR PERSONALITIES EMERGED WITHOUT ANY EXPERIENCE OFFISH TRYING TO EAT THEM. SO IT SEEMS THAT THE TWO TRAITSBOLDNESS AND WELL-DEFENDED SHELLSARE GENETIC, ANDHAVE EVOLVED ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER. THE SCIENTISTS CALL THIS THE GHOST OF PREDATION PAST. THE HUNGRY FISH THAT PURSUED R. BALTHICA IN ITS HISTORY HAVE LEFT THEIR MARK ON ITS DNA. TODAY, EVEN IF THEY GROW UP IN A SAFE SPACE, SNAILS ONLY ACT FEARLESS IF THEIR BODIES CAN BACK THEM UP. OR MAYBE THEY LEARNED FROM AESOP:PREPAREDNESS FOR WAR IS THE BEST GUARANTEE OF PEACE.

93	POPE TO CELEBRATE SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS FOR 20,000 AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN BY BETH GRIFFIN CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE NEW YORK (CNS) A SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS IS IN THE WORKS WHEN POPE FRANCIS CELEBRATES THE LITURGY WITH 20,000 PEOPLE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN DURING HIS U.S. VISIT. SIMPLE TAKES ON A NEW DIMENSION WHEN THE POPE IS THE CELEBRANT AND THE CONGREGATION CLEARS SECURITY CHECKPOINTS HOURS BEFORE THE OPENING NOTES OF THE ENTRANCE HYMN AT THE SEPT. 25 CELEBRATION. IN SUBSTANCE, EVERY MASS IS THE SAME. THIS ONE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE ELABORATE, NEW YORK CARDINAL TIMOTHY M. DOLAN SAID OF THE ARCHDIOCESES PLANNING EFFORT SEPT. 2. THE LITURGICAL OPTION FOR THE DAY IS THE MASS FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID, EXPLAINING THAT THE CHOICE REFLECTS THE HIGH EMPHASIS POPE FRANCIS PUTS ON THIS, AND BECAUSE THAT DAY HE WILL BE AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND ALSO VISIT TWO SITES IN THE ARCHDIOCESE DEVOTED TO THAT. THE READINGS AND PRAYERS ARE A GIVEN, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID. BUT THE MUSIC, THE GIFTS, THE INTERCESSIONS, THE READERS AND OTHER ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY SELECTED TO REPRESENT THE DIVERSE LANGUAGES, FAMILIES, APOSTOLATES, PARISHES AND MINISTRIES OF THIS VAST REGION, HE SAID. FATHER MATTHEW ERNEST, DIRECTOR OF THE ARCHDIOCESAN OFFICE OF LITURGY, TOLD CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE, THAT SOME OF THE LITURGICAL OPTIONS SELECTED WILL MAKE IT MORE LIKE A SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS, INCLUDING ELIMINATING THE GLORIA AND THE CREED AND USING ONLY ONE READING BEFORE THE GOSPEL. FATHER ERNEST SAID THE FIRST READING WILL BE IN SPANISH, THE GOSPEL WILL BE SUNG IN ENGLISH, AND POPE FRANCIS WILL OFFER THE SECOND EUCHARISTIC PRAYER IN LATIN. HE IS EXPECTED TO PREACH THE HOMILY IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. INTERCESSIONS WILL BE MADE IN ENGLISH, SPANISH, POLISH, GAELIC, GERMAN TIGRINYA AND ITALIAN. THE LITURGIST SAID THE POPE WILL CONCELEBRATE THE MASS WITH CARDINALS, BISHOPS FROM THE NEW YORK PROVINCE AND AN AS-YET-UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF LOCAL PRIESTS. OTHER PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE FAITHFUL PARISHIONERS WHO REPRESENT COMMUNITIES OR MINISTRIES AND SEMINARIANS STUDYING AT ST. JOSEPHS SEMINARY IN YONKERS, NEW YORK. THE SEMINARIANS WILL BE THE SERVERS AND, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THEYRE THRILLED, FATHER ERNEST SAID. WERE PUTTING ALL THE SEMINARIANS TO WORK. THEYRE NOT SIMPLY ATTENDING THE EVENT. SOME ARE SINGING, SOME ARE SERVING, SOME WILL DIRECT TRAFFIC IN THE HALLS. JENNIFER DONELSON, DIRECTOR OF SACRED MUSIC AT THE SEMINARY, SAID 10 SEMINARIANS FROM THE SCHOOLS SCHOLA CHOIR WILL SING THE COMMUNION ANTIPHON. FATHER ERNEST SAID THE VATICAN MADE FEW REQUESTS BEYOND KEEPING THE LITURGY SIMPLE. THE VATICAN ASKED THAT THE GIFTS BE PRESENTED BY A MULTIGENERATIONAL FAMILY, HE SAID. INITIAL PLANNING FOR THE PAPAL MASS BEGAN IN APRIL, FATHER ERNEST SAID. HE CONSULTED WITH THE PRIEST WHO PLANNED POPE BENEDICT XVIS MASS IN WASHINGTON IN 2008. VOLUNTEERS WERE RECRUITED AND COMMITTEES FORMED. FATHER ERNEST PRAISED THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO REVIEW THE EVENTS DETAILS. THIS IS MASS ON A STAGE. IT REQUIRES FORETHOUGHT WITH REGARD TO THE MOVEMENT AND PLACEMENT OF PEOPLE, HE SAID. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS PROVIDING FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF HOLY COMMUNION TO 20,000 PEOPLE, FATHER ERNEST SAID. MORE THAN 200 PERMANENT DEACONS FROM THE ARCHDIOCESE AND THE DIOCESES OF BROOKLYN AND ROCKVILLE CENTRE WILL BE DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AS EUCHARISTIC MINISTERS. THEY WILL BE ASSISTED BY 150 VOLUNTEERS FROM GROUPS INCLUDING THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS, KNIGHTS OF MALTA, KNIGHTS OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE AND ANCIENT ORDER OF HIBERNIANS. FATHER ERNEST SAID IMMIGRANT WOMEN FROM THE OBREROS UNIDOS MISSION IN YONKERS ARE EMBROIDERING THE ALTAR LINENS AND PURIFICATORS. MANY OF THE ITEMS USED AT THE MASS MAY LOOK FAMILIAR. THE SIMPLE CIBORIA WILL BE THE SAME DESIGN AS THOSE USED FOR POPE BENEDICT XVIS MASS AT YANKEE STADIUM. THEIR LIDS HAVE A COMMEMORATIVE INSCRIPTION AND THE SIDES BEAR THE PAPAL COAT OF ARMS AND THE SEAL OF THE ARCHDIOCESE. AS IN 2008, THEY WILL BE GIVEN TO NEW YORK PARISHES AFTER THE VISIT. POPE FRANCIS WILL USE THE SAME CHALICE POPE BLESSED PAUL VI USED WHEN HE CELEBRATED MASS IN YANKEE STADIUM OCT. 4, 1965. IT IS CURRENTLY ON DISPLAY AT ST. JOSEPHS SEMINARY. CARDINAL DOLAN SAID THE HOLY FATHER WILL CARRY A PASTORAL STAFF THAT IS A REPLICA OF ONE USED IN NEW YORK BY PAUL VI, JOHN PAUL II AND BENEDICT XVI. SPEAKING COURTSIDE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, THE CARDINAL UNVEILED THE OAK PRESIDERS CHAIR POPE FRANCIS WILL USE AT THE MASS. IT WAS BUILT BY IMMIGRANT DAY LABORERS FROM THE DON BOSCO WORKERS, INC. IN PORT CHESTER, NEW YORK. THE CHAIR IS VERY IMPORTANT IN CATHOLIC IMAGINATION, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID. IT IS A GREAT SYMBOL OF UNITY AND THE TEACHING AUTHORITY THE POPE HAS. HE DESCRIBED THE WOODEN CHAIR AS VERY SIMPLE, WITH NO DESIGNS, ACCORDING WITH THE WISHES OF THE POPE. JENNIFER PASCUAL, DIRECTOR OF MUSIC AT ST. PATRICKS CATHEDRAL, TOLD CNS THAT THE MUSIC FOR THE MASS WILL BE PROVIDED UNDER HER DIRECTION BY 115 MEMBERS OF TWO CHOIRS NEW YORK ARCHDIOCESAN FESTIVAL CHORALE AND THE CATHEDRAL CHOIR OF ST. PATRICKS AND A 40-PERSON ORCHESTRA. THE ORCHESTRA IS BEING ASSEMBLED WITH THE HELP OF A CONTRACTOR, SHE SAID, AND IS COMPRISED OF A LOT OF FAITH-FILLED PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCITED TO BE HERE. PASCUAL COMMISSIONED SOME MUSIC, BUT GENERALLY CHOSE PIECES THAT WILL BE FAMILIAR TO THE WORSHIPPERS AND ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION. SOME OF THE SELECTIONS ARE MULTILINGUAL. IM TRYING TO MAKE IT AS CONGREGATIONAL-FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE, SHE SAID. SEPTEMBER 3, 2015 ADMIN COMMENTS OFF ON POPE TO CELEBRATE SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS FOR 20,000 AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
94	LORD BYRON GEORGE GORDON BYRON (LATER NOEL), 6TH BARON BYRON, FRS (22 JANUARY 1788 19 APRIL 1824), COMMONLY KNOWN SIMPLY AS LORD BYRON, WAS AN ENGLISH POET AND A LEADING FIGURE IN THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT. AMONG BYRON'S BEST-KNOWN WORKS ARE THE LENGTHY NARRATIVE POEMS DON JUAN AND CHILDE HAROLD'S PILGRIMAGE AND THE SHORT LYRIC SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY.

IS NOT THE PAST ALL SHADOW?WHAT ARE THEY? CREATIONS OF THE MIND?THE MIND CAN MAKE SUBSTANCE, AND PEOPLE PLANETS OF ITS OWN WITH BEINGS BRIGHTER THAN HAVE BEEN, AND GIVE A BREATH TO FORMS WHICH CAN OUTLIVE ALL FLESH. I WOULD RECALL A VISION WHICH I DREAMED PERCHANCE IN SLEEPFOR IN ITSELF A THOUGHT, A SLUMBERING THOUGHT, IS CAPABLE OF YEARS, AND CURDLES A LONG LIFE INTO ONE HOUR. II I SAW TWO BEINGS IN THE HUES OF YOUTH STANDING UPON A HILL, A GENTLE HILL, GREEN AND OF MILD DECLIVITY, THE LAST AS 'TWERE THE CAPE OF A LONG RIDGE OF SUCH, SAVE THAT THERE WAS NO SEA TO LAVE ITS BASE, BUT A MOST LIVING LANDSCAPE, AND THE WAVE OF WOODS AND CORNFIELDS, AND THE ABODES OF MEN SCATTERED AT INTERVALS, AND WREATHING SMOKE ARISING FROM SUCH RUSTIC ROOFS;THE HILL WAS CROWNED WITH A PECULIAR DIADEM OF TREES, IN CIRCULAR ARRAY, SO FIXED, NOT BY THE SPORT OF NATURE, BUT OF MAN: THESE TWO, A MAIDEN AND A YOUTH, WERE THERE GAZINGTHE ONE ON ALL THAT WAS BENEATH FAIR AS HERSELFBUT THE BOY GAZED ON HER; AND BOTH WERE YOUNG, AND ONE WAS BEAUTIFUL: AND BOTH WERE YOUNGYET NOT ALIKE IN YOUTH. AS THE SWEET MOON ON THE HORIZON'S VERGE, THE MAID WAS ON THE EVE OF WOMANHOOD; THE BOY HAD FEWER SUMMERS, BUT HIS HEART HAD FAR OUTGROWN HIS YEARS, AND TO HIS EYE THERE WAS BUT ONE BELOVD FACE ON EARTH, AND THAT WAS SHINING ON HIM: HE HAD LOOKED UPON IT TILL IT COULD NOT PASS AWAY; HE HAD NO BREATH, NO BEING, BUT IN HERS; SHE WAS HIS VOICE; HE DID NOT SPEAK TO HER, BUT TREMBLED ON HER WORDS; SHE WAS HIS SIGHT,I FOR HIS EYE FOLLOWED HERS, AND SAW WITH HERS, WHICH COLOURED ALL HIS OBJECTS:HE HAD CEASED TO LIVE WITHIN HIMSELF; SHE WAS HIS LIFE, THE OCEAN TO THE RIVER OF HIS THOUGHTS, WHICH TERMINATED ALL: UPON A TONE, A TOUCH OF HERS, HIS BLOOD WOULD EBB AND FLOW, AND HIS CHEEK CHANGE TEMPESTUOUSLYHIS HEART UNKNOWING OF ITS CAUSE OF AGONY. BUT SHE IN THESE FOND FEELINGS HAD NO SHARE: HER SIGHS WERE NOT FOR HIM; TO HER HE WAS EVEN AS A BROTHERBUT NO MORE; 'TWAS MUCH, FOR BROTHERLESS SHE WAS, SAVE IN THE NAME HER INFANT FRIENDSHIP HAD BESTOWED ON HIM; HERSELF THE SOLITARY SCION LEFT OF A TIME-HONOURED RACE.IT WAS A NAME WHICH PLEASED HIM, AND YET PLEASED HIM NOTAND WHY? TIME TAUGHT HIM A DEEP ANSWERWHEN SHE LOVED ANOTHER: EVEN NOW SHE LOVED ANOTHER, AND ON THE SUMMIT OF THAT HILL SHE STOOD LOOKING AFAR IF YET HER LOVER'S STEED KEPT PACE WITH HER EXPECTANCY, AND FLEW. III A CHANGE CAME O'ER THE SPIRIT OF MY DREAM. THERE WAS AN ANCIENT MANSION, AND BEFORE ITS WALLS THERE WAS A STEED CAPARISONED: WITHIN AN ANTIQUE ORATORY STOOD THE BOY OF WHOM I SPAKE;HE WAS ALONE, AND PALE, AND PACING TO AND FRO: ANON HE SATE HIM DOWN, AND SEIZED A PEN, AND TRACED WORDS WHICH I COULD NOT GUESS OF; THEN HE LEANED HIS BOWED HEAD ON HIS HANDS, AND SHOOK AS 'TWERE WITH A CONVULSIONTHEN AROSE AGAIN, AND WITH HIS TEETH AND QUIVERING HANDS DID TEAR WHAT HE HAD WRITTEN, BUT HE SHED NO TEARS. AND HE DID CALM HIMSELF, AND FIX HIS BROW INTO A KIND OF QUIET: AS HE PAUSED, THE LADY OF HIS LOVE RE-ENTERED THERE; SHE WAS SERENE AND SMILING THEN, AND YET SHE KNEW SHE WAS BY HIM BELOVEDSHE KNEW, FOR QUICKLY COMES SUCH KNOWLEDGE, THAT HIS HEART WAS DARKENED WITH HER SHADOW, AND SHE SAW THAT HE WAS WRETCHED, BUT SHE SAW NOT ALL. HE ROSE, AND WITH A COLD AND GENTLE GRASP HE TOOK HER HAND; A MOMENT O'ER HIS FACE A TABLET OF UNUTTERABLE THOUGHTS WAS TRACED, AND THEN IT FADED, AS IT CAME; HE DROPPED THE HAND HE HELD, AND WITH SLOW STEPS RETIRED, BUT NOT AS BIDDING HER ADIEU, FOR THEY DID PART WITH MUTUAL SMILES; HE PASSED FROM OUT THE MASSY GATE OF THAT OLD HALL, AND MOUNTING ON HIS STEED HE WENT HIS WAY; AND NE'ER REPASSED THAT HOARY THRESHOLD MORE. IV A CHANGE CAME O'ER THE SPIRIT OF MY DREAM. THE BOY WAS SPRUNG TO MANHOOD: IN THE WILDS OF FIERY CLIMES HE MADE HIMSELF A HOME, AND HIS SOUL DRANK THEIR SUNBEAMS: HE WAS GIRT WITH STRANGE AND DUSKY ASPECTS; HE WAS NOT HIMSELF LIKE WHAT HE HAD BEEN; ON THE SEA AND ON THE SHORE HE WAS A WANDERER; THERE WAS A MASS OF MANY IMAGES CROWDED LIKE WAVES UPON ME, BUT HE WAS A PART OF ALL; AND IN THE LAST HE LAY REPOSING FROM THE NOONTIDE SULTRINESS, COUCHED AMONG FALLEN COLUMNS, IN THE SHADE OF RUINED WALLS THAT HAD SURVIVED THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO REARED THEM; BY HIS SLEEPING SIDE STOOD CAMELS GRAZING, AND SOME GOODLY STEEDS WERE FASTENED NEAR A FOUNTAIN; AND A MAN CLAD IN A FLOWING GARB DID WATCH THE WHILE, WHILE MANY OF HIS TRIBE SLUMBERED AROUND: AND THEY WERE CANOPIED BY THE BLUE SKY, SO CLOUDLESS, CLEAR, AND PURELY BEAUTIFUL, THAT GOD ALONE WAS TO BE SEEN IN HEAVEN. V A CHANGE CAME O'ER THE SPIRIT OF MY DREAM. THE LADY OF HIS LOVE WAS WED WITH ONE WHO DID NOT LOVE HER BETTER:IN HER HOME, A THOUSAND LEAGUES FROM HIS,HER NATIVE HOME, SHE DWELT, BEGIRT WITH GROWING INFANCY, DAUGHTERS AND SONS OF BEAUTY,BUT BEHOLD! UPON HER FACE THERE WAS THE TINT OF GRIEF, THE SETTLED SHADOW OF AN INWARD STRIFE, AND AN UNQUIET DROOPING OF THE EYE, AS IF ITS LID WERE CHARGED WITH UNSHED TEARS. WHAT COULD HER GRIEF BE?SHE HAD ALL SHE LOVED, AND HE WHO HAD SO LOVED HER WAS NOT THERE TO TROUBLE WITH BAD HOPES, OR EVIL WISH, OR ILL-REPRESSED AFFLICTION, HER PURE THOUGHTS. WHAT COULD HER GRIEF BE?SHE HAD LOVED HIM NOT, NOR GIVEN HIM CAUSE TO DEEM HIMSELF BELOVED, NOR COULD HE BE A PART OF THAT WHICH PREYED UPON HER MINDA SPECTRE OF THE PAST. VI A CHANGE CAME O'ER THE SPIRIT OF MY DREAM. THE WANDERER WAS RETURNED.I SAW HIM STAND BEFORE AN ALTARWITH A GENTLE BRIDE; HER FACE WAS FAIR, BUT WAS NOT THAT WHICH MADE THE STARLIGHT OF HIS BOYHOOD;AS HE STOOD EVEN AT THE ALTAR, O'ER HIS BROW THERE CAME THE SELF-SAME ASPECT, AND THE QUIVERING SHOCK THAT IN THE ANTIQUE ORATORY SHOOK HIS BOSOM IN ITS SOLITUDE; AND THEN AS IN THAT HOURA MOMENT O'ER HIS FACE THE TABLET OF UNUTTERABLE THOUGHTS WAS TRACED,AND THEN IT FADED AS IT CAME, AND HE STOOD CALM AND QUIET, AND HE SPOKE THE FITTING VOWS, BUT HEARD NOT HIS OWN WORDS, AND ALL THINGS REELED AROUND HIM; HE COULD SEE NOT THAT WHICH WAS, NOR THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT THE OLD MANSION, AND THE ACCUSTOMED HALL, AND THE REMEMBERED CHAMBERS, AND THE PLACE, THE DAY, THE HOUR, THE SUNSHINE, AND THE SHADE, ALL THINGS PERTAINING TO THAT PLACE AND HOUR AND HER WHO WAS HIS DESTINY, CAME BACK AND THRUST THEMSELVES BETWEEN HIM AND THE LIGHT: WHAT BUSINESS HAD THEY THERE AT SUCH A TIME? VII A CHANGE CAME O'ER THE SPIRIT OF MY DREAM. THE LADY OF HIS LOVE;OH! SHE WAS CHANGED AS BY THE SICKNESS OF THE SOUL; HER MIND HAD WANDERED FROM ITS DWELLING, AND HER EYES THEY HAD NOT THEIR OWN LUSTRE, BUT THE LOOK WHICH IS NOT OF THE EARTH; SHE WAS BECOME THE QUEEN OF A FANTASTIC REALM; HER THOUGHTS WERE COMBINATIONS OF DISJOINTED THINGS; AND FORMS, IMPALPABLE AND UNPERCEIVED OF OTHERS' SIGHT, FAMILIAR WERE TO HERS. AND THIS THE WORLD CALLS FRENZY; BUT THE WISE HAVE A FAR DEEPER MADNESSAND THE GLANCE OF MELANCHOLY IS A FEARFUL GIFT; WHAT IS IT BUT THE TELESCOPE OF TRUTH? WHICH STRIPS THE DISTANCE OF ITS FANTASIES, AND BRINGS LIFE NEAR IN UTTER NAKEDNESS, MAKING THE COLD REALITY TOO REAL!J VIII A CHANGE CAME O'ER THE SPIRIT OF MY DREAM. THE WANDERER WAS ALONE AS HERETOFORE, THE BEINGS WHICH SURROUNDED HIM WERE GONE, OR WERE AT WAR WITH HIM; HE WAS A MARK FOR BLIGHT AND DESOLATION, COMPASSED ROUND WITH HATRED AND CONTENTION; PAIN WAS MIXED IN ALL WHICH WAS SERVED UP TO HIM, UNTIL, LIKE TO THE PONTIC MONARCH OF OLD DAYS, HE FED ON POISONS, AND THEY HAD NO POWER, BUT WERE A KIND OF NUTRIMENT; HE LIVED THROUGH THAT WHICH HAD BEEN DEATH TO MANY MEN, AND MADE HIM FRIENDS OF MOUNTAINS: WITH THE STARS AND THE QUICK SPIRIT OF THE UNIVERSE HE HELD HIS DIALOGUES; AND THEY DID TEACH TO HIM THE MAGIC OF THEIR MYSTERIES; TO HIM THE BOOK OF NIGHT WAS OPENED WIDE, AND VOICES FROM THE DEEP ABYSS REVEALED A MARVEL AND A SECRETBE IT SO. IX MY DREAM WAS PAST; IT HAD NO FURTHER CHANGE. IT WAS OF A STRANGE ORDER, THAT THE DOOM OF THESE TWO CREATURES SHOULD BE THUS TRACED OUT ALMOST LIKE A REALITYTHE ONE TO END IN MADNESSBOTH IN MISERY.

THE ATHLETES SPILT INTO TWO GROUPS, WHO RACED FOR ONE MILE AROUND THE ATHLETICS TRACK AT JARMAN PARK. BEFORE THE RACES, EACH RUNNER HAD TO GUESS WHAT THEIR FINISHING TIME WOULD BE AND WERE GIVEN PENALTY POINTS FOR EACH SECOND THEY WERE OUT. AT THE END OF THE RACES, THE PENALTY POINTS WERE ADDED UP BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES, WITH THE TEAM HAVING THE LOWEST SCORE WINNING THE CAPTAINS CUP WHICH THIS YEAR THE MEN WON BY A NARROW MARGIN. IN ANOTHER GVH CLUB RACE, THURSDAY SAW THE LAST IN THE SERIES OF FIVE SUMMER HANDICAP RUNS.  THE COMPLICATED POINTS SYSTEM WAS COMPILED FROM THE FIVE RACES, AND THE WINNER WILL BE ANNOUNCED AT THE GADE VALLEY AGM MEETING LATER THIS MONTH. ELSEWHERE, DYLAN WENDLEKEN FROM GADE VALLEY TRI WAS IN ACTION AT THE HERTS TRIATHLON IN WELWYN ON SUNDAY. WENDLEKEN TOOK ON HIS FAVOURITE SPRINT DISTANCE RACE, WHICH INVOLVES A 750M SWIM, A 20KM BIKE RIDE AND A 5KM RUN, FINISHING IN A TOTAL TIME OF 1:19:36 AND ACHIEVING SECOND PLACE IN HIS AGE GROUP. BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY SAW HARRIER RUSS BAILEY COMPETING IN THE HARWELL HALF MARATHON IN DIDCOT, OXFORDSHIRE. BAILEY COMPLETED THE 13.1-MILE COURSE IN 2:09:05 AS PART OF HIS TRAINING FOR THE BERLIN MARATHON ON SEPTEMBER 27.  "THE TOURNAMENT IS A GREAT WAY TO HONOR, SUPPORT AND CELEBRATE OUR NATION'S DEFENDERS THROUGH A DAY OF FUN AND FRIENDLY COMPETITION. CROSSING THE POND TO THE USA WAS PETER TUCKER WHO RAN THE CENTRAL PARK RUN FOR LIFE IN NEW YORK. TUCKER BRAVED THE HEAT TO FINISH THE 8KM RACE IN A RESPECTABE 48:35.  MAKE SURE TO SEEK OUT ELEPHANT ROCK, THE MOST FAMOUS STATUE OF THEM ALL. A GOOD TURNOUT AT THE BLACK PARK PARKRUN ON SATURDAY SAW SEVEN HARRIERS COMPETING WITH 462 OTHER RUNNERS. MATT ASHBY WAS FIRST HOME FOR THE HARRIERS IN A SPEEDY 19:16, FINISHING IN FIFTH POSITION OVERALL.  NEXT BACK WERE STEVE NEWING 20:12, PAULA COOK 26:45, CLAIRE NEWING 34:54 (PB), ALICE COOK 36:25 (PB) AND JENNY BARNETT 36:26. GADEBRIDGE PARKRUN HAD SIX GADE VALLEY HARRIERS FLYING THEIR COLOURS, WHERE JULIAN SMITH STORMED HOME IN THIRD OVERALL PLACE IN A TIME OF 20:32. SMITH WAS FOLLOWED BY JOHNNY BROOM IN A NEW PB OF 22:20, EMMA PHILLPOT 24:48 (PB), MARTIN STORRIE 25:10, ANDY BISHOP 25:24 AND ANDY NORTON 28:33.

MAYA GARNICA CONDUCT A SAFETY BRIEF BEFORE MARINES WITH THE GROUND COMBAT ELEMENT INTEGRATED TASK FORCE PARTICIPATE IN AN ASSESSMENT AT MARINE CORPS AIR GROUND COMBAT CENTER TWENTYNINE PALMS, CALIF. NAVY SECRETARY RAY MABUS SAID HE SEES NO REASON TO REQUEST EXEMPTIONS TO OPENING ALL MARINE JOBS TO WOMEN. (PHOTO: MIKE MORONES, MARINE CORPS TIMES) MARINE INFANTRY AND SPECIAL OPERATIONS SPECIALTIES WILL SOON OPEN TO WOMEN, IF THE HEAD OF THE NAVY DEPARTMENT GETS HIS WAY. AS DEADLINES LOOM ON DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER TO ALLOW WOMEN INTO FRONT-LINE COMBAT JOBS, NAVY SECRETARY RAY MABUS CALLED FOR OPENING ALL BILLETS TO FEMALE TROOPS WHO CAN MEET THE RIGOROUS STANDARDS. MARINE OFFICIALS WILL SOON OFFER THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT MABUS, THE CIVILIAN SECRETARY WHO LEADS THE NAVY DEPARTMENT INCLUDING THE MARINE CORPS MADE CLEAR THAT HE MUST SIGN OFF ON THE DECISION TO SEEK ANY EXEMPTIONS TO OPENING ALL JOBS TO WOMEN, AND HE HASN'T HAD A CHANGE OF HEART. "THAT'S STILL MY CALL, AND I'VE BEEN VERY PUBLIC," MABUS SAID IN AN EXCLUSIVE SEPT. 1 INTERVIEW. "I DO NOT SEE A REASON FOR AN EXEMPTION." MABUS SAID BOTH SEA SERVICES SHOULD KEEP PHYSICAL STANDARDS UNCHANGED. HIS CALL FOR OPENING ALL MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES TO WOMEN FOLLOWS CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS ADM. JON GREENERT'S ASSERTION IN LATE AUGUST THAT THE NAVY WOULD NOT SEEK AN EXEMPTION FOR ITS LEGENDARY SEAL TEAMS. ALL OF THE SERVICES HAVE UNTIL OCT. 1 TO SUBMIT THEIR EXEMPTION REQUESTS TO DEFENSE SECRETARY ASH CARTER, AND THE MARINE CORPS HAS NOT INDICATED WHETHER IT INTENDS TO DO SO. MABUS, HOWEVER, SIGNALED THAT HIS MIND WAS LARGELY MADE UP. "MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE PROCESS WORKS IS THAT I'M THE ONE THAT ASKS [THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT] FOR THE EXEMPTION," HE SAID. "NOW, OTHER VOICES WILL BE HEARD, THE WAY [FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY LEON] PANETTA LINED IT UP I THINK, THE WAY I READ IT IS THAT IF THE [NAVY] DEPARTMENT DOESN'T ASK FOR AN EXEMPTION, THEY WILL OPEN." MARINES WITH THE GROUND COMBAT ELEMENT INTEGRATED TASK FORCE PARTICIPATE IN ASSESSMENTS AT MARINE CORPS AIR GROUND COMBAT CENTER TWENTYNINE PALMS, CALIF. THE TASK FORCE WAS EVALUATING THE INTEGRATION OF FEMALE MARINES INTO ARTILLERY, INFANTRY AND MECHANIZED MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES THIS SUMMER. (PHOTO: MIKE MORONES, MARINE CORPS TIMES) WHILE MABUS WILL HAVE THE LAST SAY FOR THE MARINE CORPS' OWN BILLETS, U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND MUST ALSO SIGN OFF ON THE MARINE CORPS FORCES SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND TROOPS IT OVERSEES, AS WITH THE NAVY SEALS. IF SOCOM DOES NOT SEEK AN EXEMPTION, MARSOC AND SEAL TEAMS WILL OPEN TO WOMEN ON JAN. 1, 2016, ALONG WITH ANY OTHER JOBS STILL CLOSED TO WOMEN. MARINE BRASS HAVE STAYED TIGHT LIPPED ABOUT WHETHER THEY'LL SEEK GENDER EXCLUSIONS. IN A JULY HEARING FOR HIS CONFIRMATION AS CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, MARINE CORPS COMMANDANT GEN. JOSEPH DUNFORD DID NOT LET ON WHETHER A DECISION WAS IN-HAND. "WE HAVE LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE PRETTY HARD," HE TOLD THE SENATE COMMITTEE. "I EXPECT THE DATA THAT WE'VE COLLECTED OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS IN A VERY DELIBERATE, RESPONSIBLE WAY TO BE AVAILABLE TO ME IN THE AUGUST-SEPTEMBER TIMEFRAME. AND WE'LL MEET THE TIMELINE ESTABLISHED BY SECRETARY [LEON] PANETTA AND GENERAL [MARTIN] DEMPSEY IN THE LETTER FROM 2012." DUNFORD IS ON TRACK TO SEND HIS RECOMMENDATIONS TO MABUS IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, HIS SPOKESMAN LT. COL. ERIC DENT TOLD MARINE CORPS TIMES IN LATE AUGUST. THOUGH DUNFORD IS SCHEDULED TO ASSUME THE TOP JOINT CHIEFS ROLE NEXT MONTH, OFFICIALS SAID DUNFORD PLANS TO MAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING WOMEN IN COMBAT ROLES BEFORE GEN. (SEL.)

100	MERINGUE KISSES 0 POSTED ON: 09-18-2015 BY: ICED JEMS MERINGUE KISSES ARE A SIMPLE RECIPE ONCE YOU KNOW THE COMMON MISTAKES AND A FEW TIPS TO MAKE THEM PERFECT! MY TOP TIPS FOR MERINGUE KISSES ARE; USE ICING SUGAR! IT MIXES IN AND DISSOLVES A LOT QUICKER AND EASIER THAN ITS GRAINY COUNTERPART CASTER SUGAR. NEVER OPEN THE OVEN DOOR, UNLESS YOU LIKE YOU MERINGUE KISSES WITH CRACKS ALL OVER THEM (LEARNT THIS ONE THE HARD WAY). LOW AND SLOW THE BEST MERINGUES ARE COOKED ON A LOW TEMPERATURE (100-120 DEGREES) FOR 40 MINUTES OR SO. IM LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A DOUBLE OVEN, ONE WITH FAN, ONE WITHOUT. I FOUND MY MERINGUES COOKED BETTER IN THE NON-FAN OVEN. TOO HIGH AND YOU WILL SEE THE MERINGUES BROWN AS SOON AS 5 MINUTES AFTER YOU PUT THEM IN. WHEN COLOURING, USE PASTES SUCH AS SUGARFLAIR FOOD PASTE COLOURS AS A GENERAL RULE IN BAKING, THE WATERY FOOD COLOURS YOU CAN BUY IN BOTTLE FROM THE SUPERMARKETS, ARE USELESS. THEY WILL WATER DOWN YOUR MIXTURE AND YOU WILL NEVER ACHIEVE A DEEP COLOUR FROM USING THEM. USE A 2:1 RATIO, 2 PARTS ICING SUGAR TO 1 PART EGG WHITES. YOU WILL NEED (MAKES APPROX 30 MERINGUE KISSES): 150G EGG WHITES (AT ROOM TEMPERATURE) 300G ICING SUGAR (YOU COULD USE A FLAVOURED ICING SUGAR FOR GETTING UNUSUAL FLAVOURS) FOOD PASTE COLOURING START BY PREHEATING YOUR OVEN TO 120 DEGREES (100 IF USING A FAN ASSISTED OVEN). LINE THREE BAKING TRAYS WITH GREASEPROOF PAPER AND SET ON OUR WORKTOP. POUR YOUR EGG WHITES INTO A LARGE BOWL AND MIX ON A LOW SPEED USING THE WHISK ATTACHMENT UNTIL YOU SEE BUBBLES. NOW TURN IT UP TO HIGH SPEED, AND MIX UNTIL YOU GET STIFF PEAKS STICKING UP. ADD A LARGE SPOONFUL OF YOUR ICING SUGAR TO THE EGG WHITES, AND MIX UNTIL IT RETURNS TO STIFF PEAKS STAGE. REPEAT UNTIL ALL YOUR ICING SUGAR HAS BEEN MIXED IN. CONTINUE MIXING YOUR MERINGUE FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES AFTER THE LAST OF THE ICING SUGAR HAS BEEN ADDED. YOU WILL KNOW YOUR MERINGUE IS READY WHEN YOU PULL THE WHISK UP AND A STIFF PEAK HAS FORMED (THAT WONT BUDGE EVEN IF YOU TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN)! FOR THE STRIPED MERINGUE KISSES EFFECT, I PAINTED RED FOOD COLOURING INTO A DISPOSABLE PIPING BAG IN THREE STRIPES USING A PAINTBRUSH. YOU DONT NEED A LOT WHEN USING THE PASTE COLOURS. SPOON YOUR MERINGUE MIXTURE INTO THE BAG, THEN SNIP OFF THE END LEAVING AN OPENING ABOUT 3CM WIDE. IF YOURE CONFUSED AT THE MACARON TRAY IN THE BACKGROUND HERE, I PIPED SOME OF MY KISSES ONTO IT SO GET PERFECTLY EVEN SHAPES! IT WORKED A TREAT. PIPE SMALL ROUND KISSES ONTO YOUR BAKING TRAYS, MINE WERE ABOUT 5-6CM DIAMETER, I SWIRLED THE PIPING BAG AROUND GIVING A SWIRLED EFFECT TO MY KISSES. PLACE THE BAKING TRAY IN THE CENTRE OF YOUR OVEN AND BAKE FOR AROUND 40 MINUTES (BUT DEPENDING ON YOUR OVEN, THY MAKE TAKE UP TO AN HOUR). NOW HERES THE CATCH, IN AN IDEAL WORLD YOU WOULD TURN THE OVEN OFF AT THE END OF 40 MINUTES AND LEAVE THE MERINGUES IN THE OVEN UNTIL COLD.BUT YOU HAVE 2 MORE TRAYS OF KISSES TO BAKE! SO JUST REMOVE THEM AND LEAVE THEM ON THE TRAY UNTIL COOL, BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY LEAVE YOUR LAST BATCH IN THE TURNED OFF OVEN ONCE COOKED. NOW SIMPLY SERVE AND ENJOY! THEY SHOULD COME CLEAN OFF YOUR GREASEPROOF PAPER WITH NO STICKY RESIDUE LEFT BEHIND. THESE ARE GREAT IN ETON MESS, OR ON THEIR OWN WITH SOME FRESH CREAM OR GANACHE!

101	MADISON, WIS. STRUGGLING TO GENERATE FUNDRAISING AND ENTHUSIASM, REPUBLICAN SCOTT WALKER ABANDONED HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID ON MONDAY, EXITING A TURBULENT RACE THAT SAW HIM RISE TO FRONT-RUNNER AND FALL TO AFTERTHOUGHT IN A MATTER OF MONTHS. THE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR, WHO CAST HIMSELF AS A FIGHTER AND A WINNER, PLANNED TO ANNOUNCE HIS DECISION AT A NEWS CONFERENCE MONDAY EVENING IN MADISON, BECOMING THE SECOND MAJOR GOP CANDIDATE TO QUIT THE RACE. "IT HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED TO ME THAT HE IS GETTING OUT OF THE RACE," SAID IOWA STATE SEN. BRAD ZAUN, WHO ENDORSED WALKER EARLIER THIS YEAR. "I'M PROUD OF OUR EFFORTS IN IOWA. AND I THINK HE'S AN INCREDIBLE CANDIDATE. IT'S UNFORTUNATE." ONE OF THE LAST REPUBLICANS TO ENTER THE RACE, WALKER WILL JOIN FORMER TEXAS GOV. RICK PERRY AS ONE OF THE FIRST TO LEAVE IT, HAVING BEEN UNABLE TO ADJUST TO THE POPULARITY OF BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN DONALD TRUMP OR BREAK OUT IN EITHER OF GOP'S FIRST TWO DEBATES. YET COMPARED TO PERRY, WALKER'S FALL WAS DRAMATIC. HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE A TOP-TIER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR AND BUILT A MASSIVE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION, WITH PAID STAFF SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THAT DWARFED MANY OF HIS RIVALS IN SCALE AND SCOPE. "I'M NOT SURE WHAT WENT WRONG," SAID IOWA STATE SEN. MARK COSTELLO, WHO ENDORSED WALKER EARLIER THIS YEAR. "I DON'T THINK HE MADE ANY REALLY BIG MISTAKES, BUT PEOPLE LOST ENTHUSIASM." HE WILL RETURN TO HIS JOB IN WISCONSIN AS GOVERNOR, WHERE HIS TERM RUNS THROUGH 2018. WALKER, 47, TRIED TO APPEAL TO RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES, TEA PARTY CONSERVATIVES AND THE MORE TRADITIONAL GOP BASE. HE TRIED TO CAST HIMSELF AS AN UNINTIMIDATED CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER WHO HAD A RECORD OF VICTORIES IN A STATE THAT HASN'T VOTED REPUBLICAN FOR PRESIDENT SINCE 1984. HE CAME TO THE RACE HAVING WON ELECTION IN WISCONSIN THREE TIMES IN FOUR YEARS, AND HAVING GAINED A NATIONAL FOLLOWING AMONG DONORS AND CONSERVATIVES BY SUCCESSFULLY PUSHING HIS STATE TO STRIP UNION BARGAINING RIGHTS FROM ITS PUBLIC WORKERS. WALKER POINTED TO THOSE WISCONSIN WINS, IN A STATE THAT TWICE VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA AS PRESIDENT, AS SIGNS THAT HE COULD SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE A CONSERVATIVE AGENDA AS THE GOP'S WHITE HOUSE NOMINEE. HE CALLED HIMSELF "AGGRESSIVELY NORMAL" AND CAMPAIGNED ON A HARLEY-DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE, AND MADE A SPLASH IN JANUARY WITH A WELL-RECEIVED SPEECH BEFORE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES IN IOWA. GROUPS BACKING WALKER WENT ON TO RAISE $26 MILLION, TAPPING WEALTHY DONORS WHOM WALKER HAD CULTIVATED IN HIS YEARS AS GOVERNOR AND DURING HIS SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO WIN A RECALL ELECTION IN 2012. WALKER'S PRIMARY SUPER PAC, CALLED UNINTIMIDATED, HAD JUST BEGUN SPENDING, MAKING A MAJOR PUSH IN IOWA REFLECTING THE GOVERNOR'S LAST-DITCH STRATEGY TO PLACE ALL OF HIS CHIPS ON THAT FIRST-TO-VOTE STATE. THE SUPER PAC TOLD FEDERAL REGULATORS IN A FILING FRIDAY THAT IT HAD SPENT MORE THAN $1.6 MILLION BOOSTING WALKER THIS YEAR, MOST RECENTLY ON A $50,000 MAILING TO IOWA VOTERS. BUT WALKER WAS UNABLE TO ADJUST TO TRUMP'S RISE AND REPEATEDLY HAD TROUBLE CLEARLY STATING HIS POSITION ON SEVERAL ISSUES. HE TOOK DAYS TO CLARIFY WHETHER HE SUPPORTED ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP. HE INITIALLY SHOWED INTEREST IN BUILDING A WALL BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CANADA, ONLY TO LATER LAUGH IT OFF AS RIDICULOUS. WALKER ALSO DECLARED HE WASN'T A CAREER POLITICIAN, DESPITE HAVING HELD PUBLIC OFFICE FOR 22 STRAIGHT YEARS. AFTER TRUMP, BEN CARSON AND CARLY FIORINA DISPLACED WALKER AT THE TOP OF THE POLLS, WALKER TOOK A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH, PROMISING TO "WREAK HAVOC" ON WASHINGTON. HE VOWED TO TAKE ON UNIONS AS PRESIDENT, JUST AS HE DID AS WISCONSIN GOVERNOR, OUTLAWING THEM FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS AND MAKING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY RIGHT-TO-WORK. BUT THE ANTI-UNION POLICY PROPOSAL FELL FLAT; ANNOUNCED IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE SECOND GOP DEBATE, IT WASN'T MENTIONED AT ALL BY WALKER OR ANYONE ELSE ON STAGE. WHILE ONLY TEXAS SEN. TED CRUZ AND FORMER FLORIDA GOV. JEB BUSH HAD MORE SUPER PAC MONEY AVAILABLE TO BOOST THEIR CHANCES IN THE ORIGINAL 17-PERSON 2016 REPUBLICAN FIELD, WALKER STRUGGLED TO GENERATE MONEY FOR HIS OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN. HE HAS YET TO REPORT FUNDRAISING TOTALS TO FEDERAL REGULATORS, BUT TOP FUNDRAISERS AND DONORS HAVE SAID HIS PLUMMETING POLL NUMBERS LEFT THEM STRUGGLING TO GENERATE CASH. WALKER CALLED HIS SENIOR STAFF TO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION IN MADISON ON MONDAY TO REVIEW RECENT POLLING, IN WHICH HE WAS MIRED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GOP FIELD, AND HIS CAMPAIGN'S FINANCES. "I'M DISAPPOINTED," SAID STANLEY HUBBARD, A BILLIONAIRE MEDIA MOGUL FROM MINNEAPOLIS WHO HAD BACKED WALKER'S CAMPAIGN. "HE'S A GOOD MAN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD PRESIDENT." AS WORD SPREAD OF HIS DECISION TO EXIT THE RACE, REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES IN IOWA WORKING FOR OTHER CAMPAIGNS WERE ALREADY MAKING PLANS TO CONTACT STATE LAWMAKERS WHO HAD COMMITTED TO SUPPORT WALKER. THE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR HAD ASSEMBLED A CAMPAIGN ORGANIZATION IN EVERY ONE OF IOWA'S 99 COUNTIES AND HAD A NUMBER OF STATE LAWMAKERS COMMITTED TO HIM. CLIFF HURST, ONE OF WALKER'S NEW HAMPSHIRE CO-CHAIRS, WAS ALREADY PLANNING TO SHIFT TO FLORIDA SEN. MARCO RUBIO'S CAMPAIGN. HE SAID HE KNEW ABOUT THREE DAYS AGO THAT "IT WAS OVER" AND HAD BEEN DISCUSSING AN ENDORSEMENT OF RUBIO AS OF MONDAY MORNING, BEFORE WALKER'S ANNOUNCEMENT BECAME OFFICIAL. "IT WAS PERSONALLY HARD, BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S OVER. I KNEW WHEN IT WAS OVER," HURST SAID. "I'M SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ARE @ LESS THAN 1 PERCENT THAT YOU'VE NOT GOING TO GET ANY MONEY." WALKER, ONE OF THE MOST DIVISIVE POLITICAL FIGURES IN WISCONSIN HISTORY, WILL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO REPAIRING HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH VOTERS IN HIS HOME STATE. HIS JOB APPROVAL RATINGS FELL DRAMATICALLY DURING HIS PRESIDENTIAL RUN, HITTING THEIR LOWEST MARK EVER OF 39 PERCENT IN AN AUGUST POLL CONDUCTED BY MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY. WISCONSIN STATE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER ROBIN VOS, A REPUBLICAN AND CLOSE ALLY OF WALKER'S, SAID HE "HAS AN AMAZING STORY TO TELL ABOUT WISCONSIN AND THE REFORMS WE PUT INTO PLACE." BUT VOS SAID HE SUSPECTS WALKER REALIZED HE WOULD HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME TAKING ATTENTION AWAY FROM OTHER CANDIDATES, LIKE TRUMP, WHO ARE "SUCKING UP A LOT OF THE OXYGEN."
102	LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY & THECURE IS CURIOSITY. HOW SEEKING CHANGE HAS BROUGHT ME EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEENLOOKING FOR. IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING MY JOURNEY, CHECK OUT THE PREVIOUS PIECES OF THE STORY HERE: WK1 , WK2 , WK3 , WK4 WEVE ALL HEARD THE SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, DOES IT MAKE A SOUND? THIS QUESTION DRAWSON MANY NOTIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE SELF, AND THAT IF ONE DOES NOT EXPERIENCE SOMETHING, THAN THE QUESTION IS DID ITREALLY HAPPEN? BUT LETS GO BACK AND THINK INSTEAD OF THIS SCENARIO: IF LIGHTING STRIKES IN THE WOODS AND STARTS A FIRE, BUT NO ONE IS AROUND TO SEE IT, WILL IT STILL BURN A PART OF THE FOREST DOWN? THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS YES. OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY DOES NOT DICTATE WHAT IS REAL, BUT MERELY WHAT WE ARE PERCEIVING AS AN ACTIVE PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE EXIST. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES, HOW DO WE INCLUDE THIS LIGHTNING STRIKE IN OUR LIVES SO THAT WE CAN BE AN ACTIVE FORCE IN STOPPING THE FOREST FIRE? THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. SINCE WE CANT CHANGE WHERE THE LIGHTNING STRIKES, WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE OUT LOOKING FOR IT. IN SHORT, IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD, WE HAVE TO BE AN ACTIVE PIECE IN IT. OUR BODIES ARE TEMPLES FOR OUR MINDS FLESHY PRISONS WITH WHICH WE TRAVERSE THIS LIFE IN ORDER TO SEEK BALANCE AND PEACE AND FREEDOM. HOWEVER, IN THIS BELIEF, OUR BODIES ARE STILL PLAYERS IN THE GAME OF LIFE; THEY ARE THETEMPLE WITHIN WHICH OUR MINDS RESIDE, SO SHOULDNT WE BE TREATING OUR TEMPLES LIKE TEMPLES?! AND BY THIS, I MEAN TO PUSH OUR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND STAMINA TO THEIR LIMITS AND TO SEEK CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT ON THIS PHYSICAL FORM IN WHICH EXIST. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUS AAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. LETS PLAY THE WHAT IF GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS: WHAT IF YOU ARE WALKING TO YOUR CAR AND THREE PEOPLE GET THE DROP ON YOU; COULD YOU DEFEND YOURSELF? WHAT IF YOUR HOME CATCHES ON FIRE AND THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THE SECOND STORY WINDOW; DO YOU KNOW HOW TO JUMP AND LAND SAFELY? WHAT IF YOUR SON WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM? WHAT IF YOU WORKED A FEW MINUTES FROM HOME AND YOUR WIFE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND NEEDED YOU HOME IMMEDIATELY,BUT YOUR CAR WAS DEAD IN THE PARKING LOT, COULD YOU RUN ALL THE WAY HOME? CAN YOU PROTECT THE ONES YOU LOVE? COULD YOU OUTRUN SOMETHING HUNTING YOU DOWN? CAN YOU SURVIVE ON YOUR OWN WHEN TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE WITHIN REACH TO HELP YOU? I SPENT THE WEEK PRACTICING HUAQUAN AND RUNNING. MY BEST FRIEND, ALSO AN ADVENTURE ENTHUSIAST, AND I SPENT THE WEEKENDCLIMBING THROUGH AERIAL OBSTACLE COURSES IN THE TREES OF THE BERKSHIRES IN MASSACHUSETTS.AFTER THE LONG WEEKEND, I BEGAN THE WEEK LIKE I ALWAYS DO, EXHAUSTED; BUT I COULD FEEL THE HAPPINESS IN EACH SORE MUSCLE FIBER. THE ELONGATED SIGH AS ONE SETTLES IN TO THE COUCH AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, OR INTO A HOT TUB ON THE FIRST DAY OF VACATION, THAT IS WHAT EACH OF MY MUSCLES FEELS. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUSAAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. SO WHAT HAS THIS SHOWN ME? WELL FIRST, LETS RECAP THE RECENT FOUR WEEKS CHALLENGES: I HAVE BEGUN TO REFINE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SINCE I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY. MY GIRLFRIEND STARTED A NEW JOB AS A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHICH REQUIRES HER TO BE WAKING UP AT 3:30AM MOST MORNINGS (LAST NIGHT WE AWOKE AT 1:45AM). I HAVE BEGUN TO WAKE UP WITH HER, AS OPPOSED TO 6AM, AND ENSURE THAT HER BREAKFAST/ LUNCH ARE READY FOR THE DAY. I DONT WORK OUT FOR TWO HOURS, BUT FOR A HALF AN HOUR: A WARM UP ROUTINE CONSISTING OF PUSH UPS, SIT UPS, LEG RAISES, AND TRICEP DIPS. I SPEND THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING IMMERSED IN THE ONLINE WORLD CHECKING EMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS, NETWORKING, WORKING ON WRITING/ EDITING, OR SOME MORNINGS JUST GAMING. AS MY LIFE EVOLVES, SO MUST I. THOSE THAT ARE AFRAID OF CHANGE GET LEFT IN THE DUST. MILAN KUNDERA, CZECH BORN EXISTENTIAL WRITER, POSED THAT: ANYONE WHOSE GOAL IS SOMETHING HIGHER MUST EXPECT SOMEDAY TO SUFFER VERTIGO. WHAT IS VERTIGO? FEAR OF FALLING? NO, VERTIGO IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN FEAR OF FALLING. IT IS THE VOICE OF THE EMPTINESS BELOW US WHICH TEMPTS AND LURES US, IT IS THE DESIRE TO FALL, AGAINST WHICH, TERRIFIED, WE DEFEND OURSELVES. I TIME LAST WEEK WORKING ON EXACTLY WHAT I SET OUT TO DO. I DREW UP A BUSINESS PLAN FOR LAUNCHING MY OWN COMPANY.OVER THE COURSE THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE RESEARCHED SIMILAR PEOPLE TO MYSELF AND THEIR VENTURES. THE VERDICT IS IN: STARTING OUT ON YOUR OWN IS DIFFICULT; IN WAYS THAT I COULD SIT HERE AND DESCRIBE TO YOU, BUT I DONT WANT YOU TO BE AFRAID OF EVER DOING IT.IT REQUIRES PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE AND A LOT OF HARD WORK. AS ANAIS NIN WROTE, LIFE SHRINKS OR EXPANDS IN PROPORTION TO ONES COURAGE. IF YOU DESIRE STRONGLY ENOUGH AND POSSESS THE PROPER COURAGE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. I PRESENTED MYBUSINESS PLAN TO MY BEST FRIEND OVER COFFEE. WE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF MY PLAN. IT WILL REQUIRE HUGE EFFORT AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR FREE TIME. HOWEVER, AFTER MUCH DELIBERATING, WE HAVE DECIDED TO PURSUE THIS AVENUE AS A MEANS TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE.IT WILL STILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE BUILD UP A PLATFORM FROM WHICH WE CAN LAUNCH. FOR NOW, THIS MEANSTHAT THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS OF MY JOURNEY HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS IM WELL ON THE WAY TO LOVING MY LIFE AND FINDING MORE AND MORE WAYS TO BATTLE MY DEPRESSION WHEN IT REARS ITS UGLY HEAD! HOWEVER, IM NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS METAPHOR, THATS A GOOD THING. THE ONLY WAY IN LIFE WE COULD EVER HEAR THAT TREE FALL, OR STOP THAT FOREST FIRE, IS TO BE PRESENT; AND THAT MEANS PUTTING YOURSELF INTO SITUATIONS THAT YOU WOULDNT NORMALLY BE IN. THOUGH WHAT IS NORMAL? THE TREND OF A THING TO REMAIN AT A CONSTANT ACCEPTED BY A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN PLACE. BECAUSE NORMAL FOR YOU MAY NOT BE NORMAL FOR ME. BECAUSE NORMAL ALL OVER THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT. SO GO LEARN ABOUT OTHER NORMALS. LIVE.  ADVENTURE. ALL OF LIFE IS ADVENTURE. BUT DYLLON, I DONT HAVE THE TIME TO BE ADVENTURING, OR STARTING NEW THINGS IM AN INDOORS GUY, GOING OUT AND ADVENTURING JUST ISNT FOR ME I LIVE IN A CITY, WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND A TREE IN A CITY IN 2015? THESE ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS. BUT OTHER THAN THE LAST GUY WHO IS STILL CAUGHT UP ON THE TREE METAPHOR, KEEP IN MIND WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY, ADVENTURE. TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER ANY TIME PERIOD IN YOUR LIFE. OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE REMEMBERING THE TIME PERIOD BASED ON THE EVENTS. YOU DONT REMEMBER EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR DAYS BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE WASNT EXCITING; EVERY MINUTE DIDNT LEAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION ON YOU. WHAT STANDS OUT IN LIFE WHAT REALLY GIVES YOU ENERGY AND MAKES YOU GO IS THE UNUSUAL, THE CHANGE, & THE AWESOME. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. WALKING TO THE BATHROOM ON YOUR HANDS. BUILDING A FORT WITH YOUR KIDS. COOKING A FOREIGN DISH FOR AROUND THE WORLD NIGHT FOR YOUR WIFE. SEEING A TREND? REMEMBER: CHALLENGING YOURSELF WILL ONLY PRODUCE POSITIVE EFFECTS. NEW EXPERIENCES CAN ONLY CAUSE US TO GROW. THUSLY, MY CHALLENGE FOR THIS UPCOMING WEEK WILL BE TO ADVENTURE AT LEAST ONCE A DAY, AND DO SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING AT LEAST ONCEEACH WEEK. LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY, AND THE CURE IS CURIOSITY. CURIOSITY IS THE FUEL OF THE SOUL.

103	EINDHOVEN (THE NETHERLANDS) PSV EINDHOVENS LU-CIANO NARSINGH STRUCK A SECOND-HALF WINNER AS THEY FOUGHT BACK TO CLAIM A 2-1 VICTORY AGAINST A MANCHESTER UNITED SIDE WHO LOST LUKE SHAW TO A DOUBLE LEG FRACTURE IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE LATE ON TUESDAY. 20-YEAR-OLD LEFT BACK SHAW WAS TAKEN OFF ON A STRETCHER WITH AN OXYGEN MASK STRAPPED TO HIS FACE AFTER SUFFERING THE INJURY TO HIS RIGHT LEG IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE GROUP B GAME. THE MATCH LOOKED TO BE HEADING UNITEDS WAY AND THEIR CLOSE-SEASON SIGNING FROM PSV, MEMPHIS DEPAY, REMINDED FANS AT THE PHILIPS STADIUM OF HIS PROWESS WITH A SUPERB 41ST-MINUTE OPENER. THE HOSTS, HOWEVER, CAUGHT UNITED NAPPING AT A CORNER IN FIRST-HALF STOPPAGE TIME AS HECTOR MORENO, WHOSE CRUNCHING TACKLE HAD FORCED SHAW TO LEAVE THE PITCH, EQUALISED BEFORE A SWIFT BREAKAWAY SET UP THE 57TH-MINUTE WINNER. WE ARE DOMINATING THE GAME, WE ARE CREATING CHANCES AND WE ARE NOT FINISHING. THE FIRST CHANCE THEY HAVE, THE CORNER KICK, THEY SCORED, SAID UNITED MANAGER LOUIS VAN GAAL. THE SECOND GOAL, WE WERE ATTACKING AND THEN WE LOSE THE BALL IN THE FIRST PHASE AND THEY SCORED. ITS FANTASTIC FOR PSV BUT FOR US IT IS VERY BAD. PSV MANAGER PHILLIP COCU TOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE: WE DISPLAYED SOME GOOD FOOTBALL AT TIMES BUT MOSTLY WE FOUGHT HARD. WE KEPT FIGHTING AFTER GOING BEHIND, FIGHTING TO CREATE CHANCES. THEY PLAY SO EASILY, YOU JUST DONT GET MANY CHANCES AGAINST UNITED. BUT WE TOOK OURS. THE SUPPORTERS WERE FANTASTIC. TOGETHER THEY TOOK US OVER THE WINNING LINE. UNITED TOOK THE GAME TO PSV WITH THE 21-YEAR-OLD DEPAY, WARMLY WELCOMED BACK BY THE HOME SUPPORTERS, AND NEWLY-SIGNED FORMER AS MONACO FORWARD ANTHONY MARTIAL LOOKING DANGEROUS IN A TWO-PRONGED ATTACK. DEPAYS PASS SET UP MARTIAL, THE WORLDS MOST EXPENSIVE TEENAGER, FOR WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A TAP-IN FROM CLOSE RANGE AFTER SEVEN MINUTES BUT THE FRENCH YOUNGSTER FAILED TO PUT ENOUGH FORCE INTO THE EFFORT. SHAWS INJURY CAME AFTER 15 MINUTES WHEN A BURST OF ACCELERATION PUT HIM THROUGH ON GOAL BEFORE HE WAS HALTED BY MORENOS POOR CHALLENGE, WHICH WENT UNPUNISHED. THE MATCH WAS HALTED FOR EIGHT MINUTES AS MEDICS PUT SHAW ON A STRETCHER AND TOOK HIM OFF THE PITCH. DEPAYS GOAL WAS A BREATHTAKING DISPLAY OF FOOTWORK, SET UP BY FELLOW DUTCHMAN DALEY BLIND, WHO WAS JEERED THROUGHOUT THE GAME BECAUSE OF HIS PREVIOUS CONNECTION TO AJAX AMSTERDAM. AS THE MATCH WENT INTO A LENGTHY PERIOD OF STOPPAGE TIME AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF, MORENO ROSE TO HEAD HOME A CORNER, WITH BLIND HELPING THE BALL INTO HIS OWN NET. REUTERS
104	A NEW STUDY PUBLISHED BY AMERICAN FUNDS, A FAMILY OF MUTUAL FUNDS FROM CAPITAL GROUP, ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS, IDENTIFIES THREE CRITICAL FACTORS FOR SELECTING RETIREMENT INVESTMENTS: A LOW EXPENSE RATIO, HIGH MANAGER OWNERSHIP AND A LOW DOWNSIDE CAPTURE RATIO, WHICH MEASURES HOW A FUND HAS FARED RELATIVE TO THE MARKET DURING DOWNTURNS. THE STUDY FOUND THAT OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS, ACTIVELY MANAGED EQUITY FUNDS SHARING THESE THREE FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPACED INDEXES AND ACTIVE PEERS IN A WITHDRAWAL SCENARIO. "AFTER YEARS OF INVESTING DURING THEIR WORKING LIVES, MILLIONS OF BABY BOOMERS ARE BEGINNING TO DRAW ON THESE SAVINGS FOR THEIR RETIREMENTS," SAID ROB LOVELACE THE STUDY EXAMINED ACTIVELY MANAGED U.S. AND FOREIGN LARGE-CAP EQUITY FUNDS, MODERATE ALLOCATION FUNDS (MIX OF U.S. STOCKS AND BONDS) AND WORLD ALLOCATION FUNDS (MIX OF GLOBAL STOCKS AND BONDS), AS CATEGORIZED BY MORNINGSTAR. THE RESEARCH SHOWED THAT, AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR REGULAR WITHDRAWALS, FUNDS SHARING THE THREE CRITICAL FACTORS COLLECTIVELY OUTPACED INDEXES OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS, A PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE DOT-COM AND FINANCIAL CRISIS DOWNTURNS. THE SAME WAS TRUE WHEN LOOKING AT ROLLING 10-YEAR PERIODS WITHIN THAT SAME TIME FRAME. MARKET DOWNTURNS CAN BE PARTICULARLY HARMFUL TO RETIREES BECAUSE THEY ARE DRAWING REGULAR INCOME FROM THEIR PORTFOLIOS AND, WITHOUT A SALARY TO MAKE UP FOR LOSSES, THEY COULD SUFFER SERIOUS SETBACKS. "ONE OF THE KEYS TO RETIREMENT INVESTING IS DOING BETTER IN BAD TIMES," LOVELACE SAID. "PEOPLE NEED TO HOLD MORE EQUITIES TO GENERATE STRONGER LONG-TERM RETURNS FOR A RETIREMENT THAT CAN LAST DECADES. BUT STOCKS INTRODUCE MORE VOLATILITY THAN BONDS, AND INVESTORS NEED TO THINK ABOUT DOWNSIDE RESILIENCE." THE AMERICAN FUNDS' STUDY, TITLED , LOOKED AT A HYPOTHETICAL 65-YEAR-OLD RETIRING WITH $500,000 A PORTFOLIO SPLIT BETWEEN MODERATE ALLOCATION FUNDS AND WORLD ALLOCATION FUNDS SHARING THE THREE FACTORS WOULD HAVE GENERATED 85 PERCENT GREATER WEALTH THAN A BLENDED INDEX AFTER 20 YEARS. IMPORTANTLY, THIS INVESTOR WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WITHDRAW A TOTAL OF ABOUT $537,000 ABOUT THE CAPITAL GROUP THE CAPITAL GROUP IS ONE OF THE OLDEST AND LARGEST FUNDS MANAGEMENT GROUPS IN THE WORLD, MANAGING EQUITY, FIXED INCOME AND PRIVATE EQUITY ASSETS FOR ALL TYPES OF INVESTORS. SINCE 1931, CAPITAL GROUP HAS BEEN SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON DELIVERING SUPERIOR, CONSISTENT RESULTS FOR LONG-TERM INVESTORS USING HIGH-CONVICTION PORTFOLIOS, RIGOROUS RESEARCH AND INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABILITY. TODAY, CAPITAL GROUP MANAGES MORE THAN US$1.4 TRILLION * SEE THE METHODOLOGY FOR THIS STUDY. INVESTMENTS ARE NOT FDIC INSURED, NOR ARE THEY DEPOSITS OF OR GUARANTEED BY A BANK OR ANY OTHER ENTITY, SO THEY MAY LOSE VALUE. PAST RESULTS ARE NOT PREDICTIVE OF RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

105	STOCKS OF MAKERS OF BIOLOGIC AND "SPECIALTY" DRUGS PLUNGED MONDAY AFTER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE'LL SOON RELEASE A PLAN TO ADDRESS "PRICE GOUGING" IN THE INDUSTRY. IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST DAYS OF THE YEAR FOR THE STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE OF THE BIOTECH INDUSTRY. CLINTON'S ANNOUNCEMENT ON TWITTER FOLLOWED NEWS THAT DRUGMAKER TURING PHARMACEUTICALS IN AUGUST HIKED THE PRICE OF DARAPRIM, A 53-YEAR-OLD DRUG FOR TOXOPLASMOSIS, A POTENTIALLY DEADLY PARASITIC INFECTION, TO $750 PER PILL FROM $13.50. THE TOP 20 DRUGMAKERS WHOSE PRODUCTS INCLUDE BIOLOGIC OR SPECIALTY DRUGS POSTED SHARE DROPS OF MORE THAN 2 PERCENT. THE NASDAQ BIOTECHNOLOGY INDEX DROPPED 4.4 PERCENT. BIOLOGIC DRUGS ARE PRODUCED IN LIVING CELLS, AND SPECIALTY DRUGS TREAT COMPLEX, CHRONIC CONDITIONS. THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. MANY NEW DRUGS FOR CANCER, HEPATITIS C, RARE DISORDERS AND EVEN A NEW CLASS OF CHOLESTEROL DRUGS HAVE PRICES IN THE RANGE OF $80,000 OR MORE FOR A YEAR OR A COURSE OF TREATMENT. SOME ARE MAJOR MEDICAL ADVANCES, SAVING LIVES AND OTHER MEDICAL COSTS. OTHERS ARE MINOR IMPROVEMENTS, SUCH AS CANCER DRUGS THAT ADD A FEW MONTHS OF SURVIVAL OVER EXISTING MEDICINES. SO WHILE THE TURING PRICE HIKE WAS GETTING THE BLAME MONDAY FOR THE STOCK SLUMP, IT'S ONLY THE LATEST ALTHOUGH PERHAPS MOST OUTRAGEOUS EXAMPLE OF PRICE HIKES OR SKY-HIGH PRICES FOR NEWLY LAUNCHED DRUGS. INSURANCE COMPANIES, POLITICIANS, ADVOCATES FOR PATIENTS AND OTHER CRITICS HAVE BEEN BLASTING THOSE PRICES AS OUTRAGEOUS AND UNSUSTAINABLE FOR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND PATIENTS PAYING UP TO 30 PERCENT OF THE COST. VERMONT SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, CLINTON'S CHIEF RIVAL FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION, HAS BEEN RAILING ABOUT HIGH DRUG PRICES FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND RECENTLY REINTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ENABLE THE MEDICAID PROGRAM TO GET LOWER PRICES FOR SOME DRUGS AND ALLOW U.S. RESIDENTS TO BUY CHEAPER DRUGS FROM CANADA. ALTHOUGH THEIR STOCK PRICES RARELY MOVE MORE THAN 1 PERCENT IN A DAY, THE TOP 20 DRUGMAKERS TOOK SIGNIFICANT HITS MONDAY.
106	AT A HEARING ON TUESDAY, CONGRESSIONAL LAWMAKERS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF 'DISRUPTIVE' COMPANIES. A WOMAN USES HER SMARTPHONE TO BOOK A TAXI IN HANOI, VIETNAM, ON SEPT. 9. IN THE US, HOUSE LAWMAKERS ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER SHARING ECONOMY SERVICES LIKE UBER AND LYFT SHOULD FACE FURTHER REGULATION AFTER A SERIES OF LABOR DISPUTES WITH WORKERS. (KHAM/REUTERS) ARE SHARING-ECONOMY COMPANIES SUCH AS UBER AND AIRBNB USING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES AND NEW JOBS? OR, ARE THEY EXPLOITING THEIR WORKERS BY DENYING THEM BENEFITS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY AVAILABLE AT MORE TRADITIONAL JOBS? FEDERAL LAWMAKERS RETURNED REPEATEDLY TO THE SECOND QUESTION AT A HEARING ON TUESDAY THAT FOCUSED ON HOW CONGRESS SHOULD REGULATE SO-CALLED ON-DEMAND ECONOMY FIRMS LIKE UBER, AIRBNB AND THUMBTACK (WHICH MATCHES USERS WITH LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS). PERHAPS PREDICTABLY, THE DEBATE OFTEN FELL ALONG PARTISAN LINES. REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE, WHICH HELD THE HEARING, EXPRESSED WARINESS ABOUT REGULATING THE INDUSTRY. DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INDUSTRYS POTENTIAL TO DENY BENEFITS TO WORKERS AND NOTED THAT WOMEN AND AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE OFTEN UNDERREPRESENTED IN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS IN THE TECH INDUSTRY, WHICH THE COMPANIES SAY THEY ARE PART OF. I FOR ONE AM MORE CONCERNED ABOUT EXISTING REGULATIONS HURTING NEW JOBS THAN I AM ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEW REGULATIONS, SAID REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R) OF TEXAS, WHO CHAIRS THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, MANUFACTURING AND TRADE. NOTING THAT THE HEARING WAS PART OF A SERIES LOOKING AT SO-CALLED DISRUPTIVE INNOVATIONS SUCH AS INTERNET OF THINGS DEVICES, HE ADDED, AS WE LOOK AT ANY DISRUPTER, WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES, IS MORE REGULATION NEEDED OR IS SOMEONE JUST WORRIED ABOUT CHANGES TO THE STATUS QUO? BUT REP. JAN SCHAKOWSKY (D) OF ILLINOIS, THE SUBCOMMITTEES RANKING MEMBER, NOTED THAT THE TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES BROUGHT BY SUCH TECHNOLOGICALLY-ENABLED FREELANCE WORK WERE NOT ALWAYS POSITIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR OLDER WORKERS WHO WERE USED TO RECEIVING BENEFITS LIKE HEALTH INSURANCE AND SOCIAL SECURITY IN FULL-TIME POSITIONS. THE WORKERS ARE ATOMIZED AND UNABLE TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN IN THEIR OWN INTEREST, AND THIS SHIFT [MEANS THAT] MANY WORK-RELATED RISKS GO FROM EMPLOYERS TO WORKERS, SHE SAID. WITH 80 MILLION AMERICANS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN SOME OF FORM OF FREELANCE WORK WHETHER DRIVING FOR RIDE-SHARING SERVICES LIKE UBER OR LYFT OR PUTTING TOGETHER FURNITURE AND MAKING FOOD DELIVERIES FOR TASKRABBIT, PARTICIPATION IN THE SO-CALLED ON-DEMAND ECONOMY HAS BEEN GROWING DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. COMMITTEE MEMBERS POINTED OUT THAT THE INDUSTRY HAD GENERATED $15 BILLION IN REVENUE IN 2013, ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY ACCOUNTING FIRM PRICEWATERHOUSE COOPERS. AND THE INDUSTRY IS PROJECTED TO GROW TO $335 BILLION IN TEN YEARS. TESTIMONY DURING THE HEARING OFTEN FOCUSED ON DEFENDING THE INDUSTRY FROM CLAIMS THAT IT EXPLOITS WORKERS, THE HILL REPORTS. WITNESSES INCLUDED LUCEELE SMITH, WHO DRIVES FOR UBER, AND MICHAEL BECKERMAN, HEAD OF LOBBYING GROUP THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION, WHO PREVIOUSLY WORKED ON CAPITOL HILL, INCLUDING WORKING FOR REP. FRED UPTON (R) OF MICHIGAN, WHO CHAIRS THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE. I HAVE WORKED IN TRADITIONAL JOBS BEFORE, BUT THERES NOTHING ELSE OUT THERE WHERE YOU CAN SET YOUR OWN SCHEDULE AND YOUR OWN GOALS, SAID MS. SMITH, AN AIR FORCE VETERAN WHO SAID SHE USED THE INCOME FROM DRIVING FOR THE SERVICE TO PAY FOR TRAVEL TO SEE HER FAMILY IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS. THE HEARING MARKED ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS HAVE FOCUSED ON WHETHER THE SHARING ECONOMY DESERVES FURTHER REGULATION, THE HILL NOTES. SO FAR, CALLS FOR FURTHER REGULATION HAVE COME FROM DEMOCRATS, SUCH AS SEN. MARK WARNER OF WEST VIRGINIA, AND FROM DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED STATEHOUSES SUCH AS MASSACHUSETTS. BUT THE HILL REPORTS THAT NO LEGISLATION ON REGULATING SHARING-ECONOMY BENEFITS HAS BEEN FILED YET. THAT TREND LOOKS LIKE IT IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE, WITH REP. UPTON, THE COMMITTEES CHAIR, SAYING ON TUESDAY THAT AT A TIME WHEN JOBS ARE STILL HARD TO FIND AND BALANCING THE BUDGET IS A CHALLENGE, WE SHOULD NOT RISK HASTY CALLS TO REGULATE. SOME STUDIES REVIEWED BY THE COMMITTEE FOUND THAT RIDE-SHARING CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE TAXI SERVICE BY DECREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS, AS ONE STUDY IN NEW YORK FOUND, OR BY MAKING ADDITIONAL RIDES AVAILABLE FOR PATRONS WHO FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET A TRADITIONAL CAB, AS ONE SURVEY OF LOW-INCOME LOS ANGELES NEIGHBORHOODS SHOWED. DESPITE THE ONGOING LABOR DISPUTES, THE SERVICES ARE GENERATING NEW JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY UNDEREMPLOYED, SEVERAL WITNESSES SAID. WEVE HEARD A LOT OF STORIES OF PEOPLE WHOVE BEEN DOWN ON THEIR LUCK, PEOPLE WHOVE JUST LEFT THE MILITARY, PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR JOBS, OR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WHAT NEXT TO DO IN THEIR LIVES, AND THEYRE ABLE TO COME TO THESE PLATFORMS, COME ONLINE, AND START FINDING NEW WORK, SAID JONATHAN LIEBER, CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR THE MARKETPLACE APP THUMBTACK.

AS THE INTERNET SAID, SNEZ MAY HAVE WON THE BACHELOR'S HEART, BUT MIKE BAIRD WON THE BACHELOR FINALE.  HOWEVER, IN RECENT YEARS, THE ASIAN MARKET HAS GENERATED FAST-GROWING DEMAND, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REPRESENT 32.3% IN 2018.GLOBAL BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS ENTERPRISES ARE MAINLY FROM EUROPE, AMERICA AND JAPAN, SUCH AS EUROPE-BASED BASF, NOVAMONT AND CORBION, AMERICA-BASED NATUREWORKS AND METABOLIX, JAPAN-BASED MITSUBISHI CHEMICAL AND SHOWA DENKO.

110	IT WAS THE ONLY REALISTIC CHANCE OF A WIN THIS SEASON FOR THE HAWKE'S BAY TUIS WOMEN'S RUGBY TEAM AND THEY BLEW IT. "WE'RE OUR OWN WORST ENEMIES. WE CAN'T BLAME THE TRAVEL LIKE LAST WEEK OR THE REFEREE. WE MADE TOO MANY ERRORS AND DRIFTED AWAY FROM THE GAME PLAN," TUIS COACH TOM BLAKE SAID AFTER SATURDAY'S NPC THIRD-ROUND 22-19 LOSS TO BAY OF PLENTY IN ROTORUA. HIS TEAM, WHICH ENJOYED 70 PER CENT OF POSSESSION, TRAILED 7-5 AT HALFTIME BUT LED 19-17 WHEN BAY OF PLENTY SCORED THE MATCH-WINNING TRY DURING THE FINAL MINUTE OF PLAY. ANOTHER SINBINNING TOOK THE TUIS TALLY TO FOUR IN THREE GAMES. "WE'RE TOP OF THE LISTS FOR SINBINNINGS, ERRORS AND MISSED TACKLES," BLAKE SAID. PROPS SHARLENA MAUI AND NATALIE COTTON BOTH BATTLED EFFECTIVELY FOR 80 MINUTES WHILE FLANKERS LAURAE BLAKE AND NAOMI HUNT HAD MASSIVE WORKRATES IN THE TUIS PACK. EXPERIENCED HALFBACK GEMMA WOODS AND CENTRE JAIMEE EDWARDS WERE THE BEST OF THE TUIS BACKS. THE HAWKE'S BAY SARACENS COMPLETED THEIR BUILDUP TO THEIR HURRICANES DEVELOPMENT COMPETITION WITH A 26-24 LOSS TO WELLINGTON DEVELOPMENT IN PALMERSTON NORTH ON SATURDAY. THE SARACENS TRAILED 26-5 AT HALFTIME AND DISPLAYED VAST IMPROVEMENT IN THE SECOND-HALF. MAGPIES FIRST FIVE-EIGHTH TYRONE ELKINGTON-MACDONALD HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE A DRAW WITH A LATE CONVERSION FROM WIDE OUT BUT IT BOUNCED OFF THE POSTS. HOOKER MIKEY SOSENE-FEAGAI, FLANKER JESSE TUHUA AND NO8 KALEB SWEET WERE INSPIRATIONAL FIGURES IN THE SARACENS PACK. MAGPIES UTILITY LEWIS MARSHALL, WHO HAD STINTS AT CENTRE AND FULLBACK, AND SECOND FIVE-EIGHTH JACKSON NEILSON WERE A DANGEROUS PAIR IN THE SARACENS BACKLINE. THE HAWKE'S BAY UNDER-19S OPENED THEIR HURRICANES COMPETITION WITH A 38-18 LOSS TO MANAWATU AT NAPIER'S MCLEAN PARK ON SATURDAY NIGHT. HAWKE'S BAY PLAYED WELL IN THE FIRST-HALF AND TRAILED 10-6 AT HALFTIME BUT WERE GUILTY OF NUMEROUS DEFENSIVE LAPSES DURING THE FINAL QUARTER. PROPS SEAN MORRISON AND MASON KEAN AND HOOKER MAX FRYATT FORMED A COHESIVE FRONTROW. FLANKER PAULA LATU AND NO8 TEINA HUIA HAD DOMINANT PATCHES. MAGPIES CENTRE JONAH LOWE AND HIS MIDFIELD PARTNER SAIFITI SAIFITI WERE THREATS ON ATTACK BUT DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CHANCES. - HAWKES BAY TODAY

IS FIFTH WITH 526 AND SPENCER BAYSON IS SIXTH WITH 519. THREE EVENTS IN THE SERIES REMAIN FOLLOWING THE GOLD CROWN. THIS IS THE FIRST FULL USAC NATIONAL MIDGET CAMPAIGN FOR THOMAS AND HES ACTUALLY IN STRIKING RANGE OF OVERTAKING THIRD PLACE RICO ABREU, WHO HAS 588 POINTS. THOMAS TOP GOAL IS TO WIN HIS FIRST USAC NATIONAL EVENT. I REALLY WANT TO WIN BAD, HE SAID. ITS FRUSTRATING REALLY. WERE A LITTLE BIT OUT-EXPERIENCED, BUT I THINK ITS DOABLE. WE NEED TO GET ALL THE STARS ALIGN FOR A NIGHT. IT WOULD BE COOL TO FINISH AT LEAST THIRD IN THE POINTS. ITS THE FIRST TIME FOR US AT A LOT OF THESE TRACKS. THOMAS RACED IN THE GOLD CROWN AT THE THREE-EIGHTHS MILE TRACK IN 2013 AND MADE THE FEATURE ON ALL THREE NIGHTS. HIS BEST FINISH WAS 18TH. WEVE HAD A COUPLE OF GOOD RUNS THERE, BUT NOTHING SPECTACULAR, THOMAS SAID. IT WILL BE OUR FIRST TIME THERE WITH THE SPIKE. WELL HAVE A CLEAN SHEET OF PAPER AS FAR AS NOTES GO. I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT. THE GOLD CROWNS FORMAT DOESNT HAVE QUALIFYING, WHICH HASNT BEEN OUR STRENGTH, AND YOU LINE UP OFF THE DRAW AND HEATS. THAT SHOULD HELP US. THOMAS WILL RACE ON SUNDAY IN THE ASCS WARRIOR REGION IN JEFF SMITHS 360-CUBIC INCH WINGED SPRINT CAR AT RANDOLPH COUNTY RACEWAY IN MOBERLY, MO. HE HAS THREE TOP-FIVES IN SEVEN STARTS IN ASCS WARRIOR. THOMAS HAS RACED ONCE PREVIOUSLY AT RANDOLPH COUNTY, IN AN ASCS WARRIOR EVENT. WE ALMOST HAD A TOP FIVE, HE SAID. WE HAD A DRIVELINE FAILURE. IM REALLY EXCITED TO GO BACK. THOMAS FINISHED 15TH IN A COMBINED ASCS NATIONAL/WARRIOR FEATURE ON AUG. 23 AT THE MISSOURI STATE FAIR SPEEDWAY IN SEDALIA. HE WAS SEVENTH IN THE HEAT AND THIRD IN THE B FEATURE. WE WENT FROM STARTING EIGHTH TO THIRD IN THE B, THOMAS SAID. THE TRACK CAME TO US. WE STARTED 19TH IN THE FEATURE AND THE TRACK RUBBERED UP INTO ONE LINE AND WE FINISHED 15TH. THOMAS FINISHED FIFTH IN THE POWRI LUCAS OIL NATIONAL MIDGET SERIES ON AUG. 21 AT LINCOLN (ILL.) SPEEDWAY. HE FINISHED 19TH ON AUG. 18 AT SPRING RUN, PA., AND NINTH ON AUG. 19 AT OXFORD, PA., IN USAC NATIONAL MIDGETS. WE STARTED 11TH IN THE POWRI FEATURE AND WERE RACING FOR THIRD WHEN I WENT ABOVE THE CUSHION AND FELL TO SIXTH, THOMAS SAID. WE DIDNT HAVE ANY YELLOWS AFTER THE FIFTH LAP. THAT MISTAKE REALLY KILLED US. WE WERE RUNNING FOURTH AT SPRING RUN AND THATS PROBABLY WHERE WE WERE GOING TO FINISH, BUT WE BROKE A RIGHT REAR HUB. THE NEXT NIGHT, AT OXFORD, WE LACKED SOME SPEED IN QUALIFYING AND STARTED 15TH IN THE FEATURE. WE MADE SOME CHANGES FOR THE HEAT RACE AND GOT THE CAR WORKING VERY GOOD AND WON IT. WE HAD A PRETTY STRONG RUN TO NINTH IN THE FEATURE.

114	YOU MAY NOTICE A FEW THINGS LOOK DIFFERENT AROUND HERE . THATS BECAUSE WE HAVE REVAMPED ISSUUS COLOR PALETTE, AS PART OF A CONTINUING EFFORT TO UNIFY OUR BRAND PRESENTATION AND EXPERIENCE ACROSS PLATFORMS. WE CALL THIS OUR LIGHT THEME. IF YOU USE OUR AWARD-WINNING IOS APP (AND IF YOU HAVENT YET, YOURE IN FOR A TREAT), ISSUUS NEW COLOR PALETTE IS AN INVERSION OF THE DARK THEME FOUND IN THAT APP. THE SHIFT IN OUR DESIGN THINKING BEGAN LAST FALL WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE IOS APP, AND I WANTED TO SHARE WHAT WE LEARNED FROM A BRAND AND UX PERSPECTIVE. THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO ROLL OUT BRAND SHIFTS AND EXPERIENCE UPDATES. ONE APPROACH IS THE BIG BANG, WHERE ALL THE GUIDELINES GET RESPECIFIED; NEW ASSETS ARE CREATED; AND PRODUCTS ARE BUILT, TESTED AND LAUNCHED ON ALL THE PLATFORMS AT ONCE. BANG! THIS PROCESS CAN WORK FOR NEW COMPANIES THAT ARE ABLE TO DESIGN FROM SCRATCH, OR FOR LARGE ENTERPRISES THAT CAN DEDICATE TEAMS OVER THE COURSE OF MONTHS, AND SOMETIMES YEARS TO THE ENDEAVOR. THE SECOND WAY IS INCREMENTAL. THIS IS BEST FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE GROWING FAST AND FOCUSING RESOURCES ACROSS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PROJECTS. AT ISSUU, OUR PRIORITY IS ON BRINGING AS MANY FEATURES TO PUBLISHERS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO HELP THEM GROW THEIR BUSINESS AND EXPAND THEIR AUDIENCE. STARTING FRESH ON IOS, WE HAD THE FREEDOM TO EXPERIMENT, SINCE THERE WASNT ANY RISK OF IMPINGING ON EXISTING USERS. WE WENT AHEAD AND REGARDED THE NATIVE APP AS A GUIDEPOST, A NORTH STAR INDICATING WHERE WE WANTED TO GO WITH THE BRAND AND EXPERIENCE. WE RECEIVED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK ON THE IOS APPS FUNCTIONALITY AND LOOK AND FEEL, AND WERE USING THIS TO INFORM OUR EVOLVING WEB AND ANDROID PLATFORMS. KEEPING IT LIGHT IN DEVELOPING THE IOS APP, WE SPECIFIED A FAMILY OF COLORS, BUTTON STYLES, TYPOGRAPHY AND PERSONAS TO BE APPLIED ACROSS ISSUU. THERE WAS SOME TECHNICAL WORK TO DO BEFORE WE COULD PUSH THESE CHANGES TO THE ENTIRE WEBSITE. WE REDESIGNED AND RELAUNCHED THE ISSUU HELP CENTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AS AN INCREMENTAL TEST TO SEE HOW IT WOULD AFFECT PERFORMANCE. ALTHOUGH THAT UPDATE DID INDEED CHANGE FUNCTIONALITY, BASED ON OUR CUSTOMER RESPONSES AND USER DATA WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT WE MADE THE RIGHT MOVES. THE TAN HUES IN THE NEW LIGHT THEME OF ISSUU.COM ARE MEANT TO WARM UP THE EXPERIENCE MAKING THE SITE A MORE INVITING AND FRIENDLY PLACE COMPARED WITH THE COLD WHITE, BLUE AND GREEN TONES FOUND BEFORE. SOME OF THE CHANGES ARE MORE SUBTLE: THE NEUTRAL GRAY USED IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE READER IS MEANT TO SHOWCASE OUR PUBLISHERS CONTENT MORE ACCURATELY THAN THE HEAVY BLUE BACKGROUND USED EARLIER, WHICH APPLIED SOMETHING OF A BLUE CAST TO THE CONTENT. TO BE CLEAR, WE HAVE NOT ALTERED FUNCTIONALITY; THIS IS SIMPLY A COLOR SHIFT. ALL THE MENU ITEMS, STACKS AND CONTROLS ARE EXACTLY IN THE SAME PLACE AND WORK THE SAME WAY. WHAT WE SEEK IS A CLEARER HIERARCHY OF EXISTING ELEMENTS, SUCH AS THE SEARCH BOX STANDING OUT IN WHITE, SCREAMING TYPE IN ME! FROM THIS POINT WE ARE MONITORING REACTIONS AND RESPONSES, ISOLATING AND ADDRESSING ANY PROBLEMS THAT ARISE. TYPE THE NEXT CHAPTER ONE ELEMENT THAT IS QUITE CHALLENGING TO CHANGE AT OUR SCALE IS TYPOGRAPHY. AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR MOBILE OFFERINGS, WE NEED TO EMPLOY A TYPE SPEC THAT ADJUSTS TO THE VARIOUS SIZES OF SCREENS FAVORED BY OUR USERS. WE HAVE ADAPTED OUR CURRENT TYPE SPEC OF 4 TO A FAMILY OF TYPE SPECS OF 28. THERE ISNT A DEFINITIVE DATE ON THIS RELEASE, BUT I PLEDGE TO KEEP YOU POSTED. BRAND GUIDELINES WILL BE CHANGING AS WELL WITH OUR NEW BRAND PAGES SHOWING UP SOON, ALONG WITH CLEARER MESSAGES ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT MAKE ISSUU GREAT. WERE ALWAYS DRIVING ADVANCES IN THE ISSUU EXPERIENCE. YET WE MAKE THESE MOVES AS THOUGHTFULLY AS POSSIBLE, AND HOPE YOU FIND THEM TO YOUR LIKING. OUR MISSION IS TO ENABLE PUBLISHERS TO THRIVE AND TO CONNECT READERS WITH THE CONTENT THEY LOVE. HAVE COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS? TWEET AT US @ISSUU . WERE EAGER TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK.

115	SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 13 2015 TEARS RAN DOWN THE FACE OF SHARMA LAKHAN, 63, AS HE RECALLED HOW, AT 21 YEARS OLD, HIS WIFE JUNNETTE INSPIRED IN HIM THE WILL TO SURVIVE AFTER LEARNING THAT HIS BOTH KIDNEYS HAD FAILED AND THERE WAS A HIGH POSSIBILITY THAT HE WOULD DIE. LAKHAN, ONE OF THE FIRST PERSONS IN THE CARIBBEAN TO RECEIVE A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT, LEARNED HE HAD A KIDNEY PROBLEM WHEN HE WAS JUST 17 YEARS OLD. NOW, HE BELIEVES GOD HAD A MISSION FOR HIM, TO GIVE OTHERS HOPE, LET THEM KNOW THAT LIFE WAS WORTH LIVING. GOD HAS EVERYTHING PLANNED. YOU MUST NOT BE AGAINST GOD IF YOU FIND THAT THINGS ARE NOT WORKING OUT THE WAY YOU THINK IT SHOULD. GOD MADE A PLAN FOR ME, TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AND GIVE OTHERS THE WILLPOWER AND INSPIRATION TO LIVE, HE SAID. AT AGE 17, LAKHAN HAD JUST RECEIVED HIS DRIVERS LICENCE WHEN HIS FATHER, RUDOLPH LAKHAN, DECIDED TO GET AN INSURANCE POLICY FOR HIS SON. THIS MEANT THAT HE HAD TO GET A CHECK UP FROM A DOCTOR. BLOOD WAS FOUND IN HIS URINE AND THE DOCTOR BELIEVED HIS KIDNEYS WERE FAILING BUT CONFIRMATION WAS NECESSARY. A BIOPSY ON HIS KIDNEY WAS PERFORMED AND THE SAMPLE WAS SENT TO ENGLAND FOR TESTS. HOWEVER, THE SAMPLE WAS CONTAMINATED BY THE TIME IT REACHED ENGLAND AND LAKHAN WAS TOO SCARED TO STAY AT THE HOSPITAL AS HE SAW THAT PEOPLE DIED IN THE BEDS AROUND HIM. THEREFORE HE GOT UP AND LEFT THE HOSPITAL WITHOUT RETURNING ALTHOUGH HE CONTINUED TO HAVE DISCOLOURED URINE, HEADACHES, AND LETHARGY. FOUR YEARS LATER, LAKHAN WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO HIS WIFE JUNNETTE. THEY HAD MET EACH OTHER AT WONGS HIGH SCHOOL IN ST JAMES AT THE AGE OF 16, AND HAD BEEN INSEPARABLE EVER SINCE. THEY HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE A DOUBLE WEDDING WITH LAKHANS BROTHER, NIRMAL LAKHAN AND HIS FIANCE MONA. HOWEVER, ONE DAY HE WOKE UP AND HIS SYMPTOMS WERE TOO SEVERE TO IGNORE, AND WITH THE ADDITIONAL SYMPTOM OF VOMITING, HE WAS TAKEN TO A DOCTOR FOR TEST. THE TESTS REVEALED LAKHAN WAS SUFFERING FROM KIDNEY FAILURE. THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM HE HAD NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL AS THERE WAS NO TREATMENT FOR THE CONDITION IN THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER, THE DOCTOR HAD HEARD THAT A NEPHROLOGIST FROM BOSTON, USA WAS IN SOUTH TRINIDAD SO THE LAKHAN FAMILY MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE DR RAM MAHABIR. LAKHAN WAS TOLD HE COULD EITHER LIVE ON DIALYSIS, OR GET A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT, NEITHER OF WHICH WAS AVAILABLE IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO. WITHOUT TREATMENT, HE WOULD HAVE TWO MONTHS TO LIVE SO HE HAD TO GO ABROAD. THE FAMILY ARRANGED FOR LAKHAN TO HAVE TESTS DONE AT NEW ENGLAND MEDICAL CENTRE IN BOSTON, WHICH HAD ONLY STARTED TO PERFORM TRANSPLANTS ONE YEAR PREVIOUSLY. IF HE COULD GET A KIDNEY, THE TRANSPLANT WOULD BE DONE. WITH HIS LIFE HANGING IN THE BALANCE AND HIS FUTURE UNSURE, LAKHAN SUGGESTED THAT THE WEDDING BE POSTPONED UNTIL AFTER THE SURGERY. HOWEVER JUNNETTE FORCEFULLY REJECTED THAT IDEA AND INSISTED THAT THEY BE MARRIED ON THE ORIGINAL DATE. SHE GAVE ME HOPE, THE INSPIRATION TO LIVE. WE WERE VERY YOUNG AND IN LOVE. I DONT THINK I WOULD HAVE LEFT TRINIDAD WITHOUT HER IN ANY CASE. THEN I HAD ALL THE SUPPORT OF MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY MY UNCLES, AUNTS, INLAWS. THEIR LOVE AND SUPPORT IS WHAT GOT ME THROUGH IT ALL, HE SAID. THEREFORE, THE COUPLE WAS MARRIED, ALONG WITH NIRMAL AND MONA, ON APRIL 28 1973, AT THE PORT-OF-SPAIN HINDU MANDIR IN ST JAMES. HOWEVER, LAKHAN WAS SO SICK THAT THE PUNDIT HAD TO HURRY THROUGH THE CEREMONY. I WAS TOO SICK FOR ANY HONEYMOON. MY WIFE MADE A LOT OF SACRIFICES, AND SHE STILL DOES. MY LOVE FOR HER GROWS EVERY SPLIT SECOND OF THE DAY, HE SAID. IN MAY OF THAT YEAR, THE FAMILY WENT TO BOSTON TO TEST WHETHER HIS FATHER OR BROTHER WERE COMPATIBLE KIDNEY DONORS. HE SAID THEY SPENT A LOT OF MONEY TRAVELLING FROM TRINIDAD TO BOSTON AND BACK, AS WELL AS FOR DIALYSIS AND THEN THE SURGERY. I WAS SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GIVE ME THEIR KIDNEYS, BOTH MY FATHER AND MY OLDER BROTHER. WHEN WE FOUND OUT MY FATHER WAS A BETTER MATCH, MY BROTHER WAS ACTUALLY DISAPPOINTED, HE SAID SMILING. THE OPERATIONS OF BOTH RUDOLPH AND HIS FATHER TOOK PLACE ON AUGUST 7. THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY FAMILY AND FRIENDS FROM ALL OVER THE US AS WELL AS TRINIDAD. LAKHAN STAYED IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 17 DAYS BUT HAD TO REMAIN IN BOSTON FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, MAKING WEEKLY OUTPATIENT VISITS, AND TAKING ANTI-REJECTION MEDICATION, WHICH HE HAS TO TAKE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. THE DRUGS WERE MAINLY STEROIDS, WHICH INCREASED HIS APPETITE AND HE PUT ON WEIGHT. HE SAID HE ATE AS MUCH AS HE COULD AND RARELY FOLLOWED DIETARY INSTRUCTIONS AS IT FELT SO GOOD TO EAT AND BE HEALTHY. AFTER I LEFT THE HOSPITAL I JUST APPRECIATED LIFE. SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS FEELING THE SUN ON MY BODY WAS WONDERFUL, HE SAID. LAKHAN RETURNED TO TRINIDAD IN NOVEMBER, FEELING STRONG AND HEALTHY. WHEN HE ARRIVED HOME IN ST JAMES, THERE WAS A LARGE PARTY TO WELCOME HIM WITH OVER 50 FRIENDS AND FAMILY, AS WELL AS LOCAL REPORTERS. THE PURPOSE OF PUTTING IT IN THE PAPERS WAS TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE WAS HELP ABROAD. THERE WAS NO HOPE HERE. PEOPLE STARTED COMING TO US FOR INFORMATION BECAUSE THEIR DOCTORS NEVER TOLD THEM THERE WAS HELP ABROAD, HE SAID. LAKHAN RETURNED TO WORK AT THE FAMILY BUSINESS, LAKHANS BAZZAR, AND IN 1978 HE AND HIS WIFE OPENED THEIR OWN BUSINESS, CHATTER BOX GIFT SHOP IN ST JAMES. THEY NOW HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS AND FIVE GRANDCHILDREN. NOW, AT HIS AGE, LAKHAN IS WATCHING WHAT HE EATS - NO SOFT DRINKS, LOW SALT, AND LOTS OF WATER. I SEE HOW THEY (HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN) ARE WORRIED NOW SO IM TRYING TO BEHAVE. I REALLY LOVE WILD MEAT AND BEER BUT I HAVE TO SHOW THEM THAT I APPRECIATE ALL THEIR EFFORTS AND CARE, HE SAID. UNFORTUNATELY, LAKHANS FATHER, RUDOLPH, DIED TEN YEARS AGO. HE DESCRIBED HIS FATHER AS HIS HERO, AND A PILLAR OF THE FAMILY. HE SAID RUDOLPH TAUGHT HIM AND HIS BROTHERS PRINCIPLES AND VALUES, RIGHT FROM WRONG, AND HOW TO STAND ON THEIR OWN FEET. WE WERE VERY CLOSE. I CARRY HIM WITH ME. THIS PHYSICAL PART OF HIM IS WITH ME ALL THE TIME. I LOVE HIM AND MISS HIM A LOT. I TALK TO HIM AND TELL HIM HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM AND APPRECIATE THE SACRIFICES HE MADE FOR ME, HE SAID.
116	THE GARDINER EAST FOLLIES RETURNS FOR YET ANOTHER EXTENDED RUN AT CITY HALL BEGINNING ON TUESDAY MORNING, WHEN CITY OFFICIALS PRESENT THREE SCENARIOS FOR RELOCATING THE HIGHWAYS EASTERN END TO FREE UP VALUABLE WATERFRONT LAND. FOR MUCH OF THIS YEAR, AND SOME OF 2014, THE LIONS SHARE OF PUBLIC, POLICY AND POLITICAL ATTENTION HAS FOCUSED INTENSIVELY ON THE STRETCH BETWEEN CHERRY STREET AND THE DON RIVER . (FOR MORE ON THE ORIGINS OF THE PROBLEMATIC LOOP, READ THIS .) FIRST GULF, WHICH WANTS TO TRANSFORM THE SPRAWLING LEVER BROTHERS SITE INTO TORONTOS CANARY WHARF, HAS A STRONG INTEREST IN THE ALIGNMENT OF THE GARDINER/DVP INTERCHANGE, AS DO THE DEVELOPERS WHO OWN LAND ALONG THE KEATING CHANNEL. IN A SHOW LAST SPRING, SUBURBAN COUNCILLORS PUSHED TO KEEP THE HIGHWAY NETWORK IN TACT, WHILE DOWNTOWNERS FOUGHT TO REPLACE THAT ONE PORTION WITH AN AT-GRADE BOULEVARD. AFTER COUNCIL BACKED THE HYBRID OPTION, STAFF SPENT THE SUMMER CONSULTING WITH WATERFRONT ACTIVISTS, DEVELOPERS AND ENGINEERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PULL THE GARDINER NORTH TOWARDS THE RAILWAY YARD WHILE RE-CONCEPTUALIZING THE INTERCHANGE AS A SET OF RAMPS BETWEEN TWO HIGHWAYS INSTEAD OF A SINGLE CONTINUOUS ROUTE. THE ARM-WAVING ABOUT THE INTERCHANGE, HOWEVER, HAS MEANT THAT ALMOST NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT NASTY SEGMENT OF THE GARDINER THAT RUNS ASTRIDE LAKESHORE BLVD EAST, BETWEEN JARVIS AND CHERRY. INDEED, THE LATEST CITY STAFF REPORT NOTES THAT THE SECTION WEST OF CHERRY WILL LARGELY BE MAINTAINED. AND THEREIN LIES A MASSIVE MISSED OPPORTUNITY, ACCORDING TO ARCHITECT AND PLANNER CALVIN BROOK. HIS FIRM, BROOK MCILROY , HAS PITCHED CITY STAFF ON AN AMBITIOUS SCHEME TO STACK THAT STRETCH OF THE GARDINER ABOVE AN EXPANDED RAIL CORRIDOR AS A MEANS OF CREATING A KILOMETRE-LONG ELEVATED LINEAR PARK, 3.3 HECTARES OF NEW DEVELOPABLE CITY LAND AND A FRESH LEASE ON LIFE FOR LAKESHORE BLVD EAST. THE PLAN [ DOWNLOAD IT FROM DROPBOX ] WILL BE PRESENTED BRIEFLY DURING TOMORROWS COMMITTEE MEETING; CITY OFFICIALS ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED THAT THEYVE COMMISSIONED A COST-BENEFIT EVALUATION. BROOK MCILROYS CONSULTANTS, MEANWHILE, ESTIMATE THAT THE CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR THAT NEW GARDINER SEGMENT WILL BE $316 MILLION AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE OFFSET BY LAND SALES ON 4.3 MILLION SQ.-FT OF FREED-UP SPACE. BROOK, WHO HAS BEEN PONDERING HOW TO UNSTACK THE GARDINER AND THE LAKESHORE FOR MANY YEARS, EXPLAINED HIS PROPOSAL TO SPACING LAST WEEK. METROLINX, HE SAYS, PLANS TO EXPAND ITS GO SERVICE FROM 400 TRAINS PER DAY TO OVER 1,000 AS THE AGENCY MOVES TO AN ELECTRIFIED REGIONAL RAIL OFFERING OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS. THAT MEANS ADDING TRACKS THROUGH THE UNION STATION CORRIDOR, AND THEREFORE WIDENING THE RAILWAY BERM THAT HAS LONG BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE WATERFRONTS POOR ACCESSIBILITY. THE CITY OWNS A LONG FINGER OF LAND SOUTH OF THE TRACKS BETWEEN JARVIS AND CHERRY, AS WELL AS THE LAND BENEATH THE GARDINER AND THE LAKESHORE; THE THREE SLICES ARE ALMOST 70 METRES ACROSS IN SOME PLACES. IF THE CITY AND METROLINX CAN ALIGN THEIR CONSTRUCTION AGENDAS, BROOK SAYS, THEY COULD EXPAND THE EXISTING BERM SOUTH TO CREATE NOT ONLY ADDITIONAL TRACK SPACE, BUT A DECK ABOVE THE NEW TRACKS, UPON WHICH THE FOUR-LANE GARDINER COULD RUN. THE HIGHWAY PORTION, IN TURN, COULD ALSO BE DECKED, CREATING A LINEAR PARK OVERHEAD. THE PREMISE OF THIS IS VERY SIMPLE, HE STATES. ITS TO TAKE TWO INTERRUPTIONS IN THE FABRIC OF THE CITY AND TURN THEM INTO ONE. BROOKS POINTS TO SEVERAL COMPELLING ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF RE-BUILDING THE EASTERN GARDINER IN THIS WAY: STAGING : THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BERM, THE RAIL LINES, THE DECKING, THE HIGHWAY AND THE GREEN ROOF COULD ALL BE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT MAKING ANY ALTERATIONS TO THE EXISTING GARDINER. THAT TRANSLATES INTO NO CONSTRUCTION DELAYS AND ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO STAGING, WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DRIVE UP CAPITAL OUTLAYS. WHEN THE NEW GARDINER IS FINISHED, TRAFFIC CAN BE RE-ROUTED ONTO IT, AND THE DEMOLITION OF THE OLD ONE CAN COMMENCE. UNLOCKING CITY-OWNED LAND . BY STACKING THE GARDINER ON TOP OF THOSE NEW RAIL LINES, THE CITY FREES UP A STRETCH OF LAND THATS ABOUT 40 METRES DEEP AND ALMOST A KILOMETRE LONG MORE THAN ENOUGH SPACE, BROOK SAYS, TO DEVELOP POINT TOWERS, MID-RISE BUILDINGS AND OTHER STRUCTURES ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF LAKESHORE BLVD. EAST PUBLIC SPACE IMPROVEMENTS . WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT NOW POSSIBLE ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF LAKESHORE, THAT STREET GAINS A SECOND LEASE ON LIFE, AND CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO AN URBAN AVENUE RATHER THAN A SURFACE HIGHWAY. LIKEWISE, THE LINEAR PARK BUILT ABOVE THE DECKED GARDINER WILL SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF THOSE BUILDINGS DEVELOPED NORTH OF LAKESHORE, AS WELL AS OTHER WATERFRONT VISITORS AND INHABITANTS. IT ALSO PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE MID-BLOCK CONNECTIONS AND EVEN WIDER LAND BRIDGES ACROSS THE TRACKS THAT WOULD LINK THE EAST BAYFRONT COMMUNITY TO ST. LAWRENCE. BROOK POINTS OUT THAT THE LINEAR PARK WILL BE ROUGHLY AT THE SAME VERTICAL ELEVATION AS THE DECK OF THE CURRENT GARDINER, SO THIS EXTENDED STRUCTURE WONT SERVE AS YET ANOTHER VISUAL BARRIER. WHATS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT ITS VERY POROUS IN A NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION, HE SAYS, WITH EASY PEDESTRIAN/CYCLIST ACCESS BETWEEN LAKESHORE, THE LINEAR PARK AND GATEWAY POINTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CORRIDOR. HE ALSO OBSERVES THAT BROOKFIELD, THE CANADIAN COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT GIANT, HAS DEPLOYED NEW DECKING TECHNOLOGY AT ITS SPRAWLING HUDSON YARDS PROJECT IN MID-TOWN MANHATTAN, ALLOWING AN ACTIVE COMMUTER RAIL YARD TO CONTINUE FUNCTIONING WHILE A MASSIVE INTENSIFICATION PROJECT IS CONSTRUCTED DIRECTLY ABOVE IT. THE IDEA REQUIRES BOTH POLITICAL WILL, BUT ALSO A LEAP OF FAITH NOT BECAUSE IT IS TECHNICALLY COMPLEX OR FINANCIALLY OUTRAGEOUS, BUT RATHER DUE TO THE FACT THAT TORONTO, WITH ITS INCREMENTALIST POLITICAL CULTURE, HAS LONG TENDED TO SHUN BIG MOVES. YET THE RAILWAY BERM, CONSTRUCTED BACK IN THE 1920S TO MODERNIZE ACCESS TO AN INDUSTRIALIZING WATERFRONT, WAS A BIG MOVE, AS WAS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE GARDINER IN THE MID-1950S. BIG MOVES, ONE COULD ARGUE, MUST BE MET WITH OTHER BIG MOVES. AND THATS WHAT BROOK WILL BE PROPOSING TOMORROW. WITH THE GARDINER EAST EA DUE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE PROVINCE BY NEXT SPRING, MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL POLITICIANS SHOULD LISTEN TO BROOK BECAUSE HIS IDEA IS NOT ONLY PLAUSIBLE; IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE TRANSFORMATIONAL IN A HIGHLY CHALLENGED GEOGRAPHY THAT REQUIRES US, FINALLY, TO MAKE NO (MORE) LITTLE PLANS .

I NOTED THAT THE 14-DAY RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX PLUMMETED TO 16.8% ON AUGUST 25. SINCE 1950, THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY 17 UNIQUE INSTANCES (NOT COUNTING REPEAT OCCURRENCES IN THE SAME CALENDAR YEAR) WHERE THE RSI FELL BELOW 20%. IN EACH OF THE PREVIOUS 16 CASES, THE S&P 500 INDEX WENT ON TO BREAK AT LEAST MARGINALLY ITS CLOSING LOW RECORDED ON THE DAY OF THE RSI LOW. SO THE ODDS, BASED ON HISTORY, ARE OVERWHELMING THAT, SOONER OR LATER, THE S&P WILL TEST ITS AUGUST 25 CLOSING LOW AT 1867.62. BUT HERES THE POTENTIAL GOOD NEWS. WHEN THE TEST OCCURS FAIRLY SOON (WITHIN, SAY, EIGHT WEEKS) AFTER THE INITIAL LOW, THE MARKET TYPICALLY PERFORMS A LOT BETTER IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS AND MONTHS THAN IF THE TEST IS DEFERRED. THUS, IF YOURE ROOTING (AS I AM) FOR WALL STREETS GREAT BULL RUN TO CONTINUE INTO 2016, YOU WANT TO GET THE TEST OVER AND DONE WITH SOON . SPECIFICALLY, YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MARKET GO BACK TO PROBE ITS AUGUST LOWS BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER. EVERY DOWN DAY TAKES US CLOSER TO COMPLETING THAT TASK. OF COURSE, DOWN DAYS ARE ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY UNPLEASANT HEADLINES. THATS THE NATURE OF THE BEAST, AS SEASONED INVESTORS UNDERSTAND. CHEERFUL NEWS REPORTS DONT PUSH STOCKS DOWN! IN AUGUST, IT WAS THE COMMODITY ROUT (OIL IN PARTICULAR) THAT DROVE THE SELLING. NOW ITS HILLARYS LATEST VENTURE INTO PHARMACEUTICAL PRICE CONTROLS, PLUS A NICE DASH OF UNCERTAINTY INTRODUCED BY VOLKSWAGENS ( VLKAY ) MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR EMISSIONS SCANDAL. IF WE TUNE OUT THE SCREECHES AND SQUAWKS OF CNBC, THOUGH, WE CAN OBSERVE THAT THE MARKET IS RETREATING IN A MUCH MORE ORDERLY FASHION THAN IT DID IN AUGUST. FAR FEWER INDIVIDUAL STOCKS ARE SCRAPING NEW 52-WEEK LOWS. TRADERS ARE BUILDING A MUCH SMALLER PANIC PREMIUM ( VIX ) INTO OPTIONS PRICES, VERSUS THE AUGUST PEAK. (SEE CHART .) THESE ARE THE FIRST HINTS THAT THE UPCOMING TEST, WHEN IT OCCURS, WILL PROVE SUCCESSFULIN THE SENSE THAT A STRONG Q4 RALLY WILL FOLLOW FOR THE HEADLINE U.S. EQUITY INDEXES. ONE OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE SECTORS RIGHT NOW, THANKS TO A SIZABLE PRICE DROP IN RECENT WEEKS, IS HEALTHCARE. HOW FICKLE WALL STREETS MOODS ARE! JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, THE STREETS BIG, BRAVE BLUSTERERS WERE BARKING AT YOU TO BUY HEALTHCARE AND ESPECIALLY THE HIGH-FLYING BIOTECHS BECAUSE THE AGING OF THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLDS POPULATION SUPPOSEDLY GUARANTEED FAT PROFITS. NOW ALL THOSE WINDBAGS ARE COWERING IN THEIR CORNERS, TERRIFIED THAT SOMEONE WITH AN EGO TO MATCH THEIR OWN IS STRUTTING ACROSS THE NATIONAL STAGE. BUT THE POLITICAL STARS ARE ALIGNED QUITE A BIT DIFFERENTLY TODAY THAN IN 2008. EVEN IF MRS. CLINTON IS ELECTED NEXT YEAR, SHELL HAVE FAR LESS SUPPORT IN CONGRESS FOR HER HEALTHCARE PROPOSALS THAN MR. OBAMA DID FOR HIS IN 2009-10. IN SHORT, I SUSPECT THAT THE RECENT SELLOFF IN PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER HEALTHCARE STOCKS GREATLY OVERSTATES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE CLINTON GOUGING MANIFESTO (OR ANYTHING LIKE IT) WILL GET ENACTED.

118	BY ANGELA LAVOIPIERRE AN IRANIAN ASYLUM SEEKER DETAINED ON NAURU HAS MADE A REPORT ABOUT HIS ALLEGED MISTREATMENT BY NAURUAN POLICE TO THE UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS AGENCY. THE MAN CLAIMS HE WAS DETAINED FOR MORE THAN 30 HOURS IN A BARE POLICE CELL THAT WAS WET WITH THE URINE OF HIS GUARDS. THE MAN HAS TOLD THE ABC AND STAFF FROM THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS THAT HE WAS ARRESTED AND DETAINED WITHOUT CHARGE AFTER TRYING TO SEE HIS SISTER. SHE HAD JUST TRIED FOR THE SECOND TIME TO KILL HERSELF AFTER BEING ALLEGEDLY RAPED ON THE ISLAND IN MAY. THE WOMAN HAS SINCE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO BRISBANE IN A SERIOUS CONDITION WHILE HER BROTHER AND MOTHER HAVE REMAINED ON NAURU. ON THE NIGHT HE WAS ARRESTED, THE 20-YEAR-OLD MAN WAS WAITING WITH HIS MOTHER FOR HER MEDICATION WHEN HE HEARD HIS SISTER'S SCREAM. HE KNOWS NOW SHE HAD DRUNK INSECTICIDE. "I JUST RUN, BECAUSE I HEARD THE SCREAMING SOUND, BECAUSE I UNDERSTOOD THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY SISTER," HE SAID. HE CLAIMS HE WAS STOPPED BY DETENTION CENTRE GUARDS, WHO GRABBED HIM AND FORCED HIM TO THE FLOOR. THE INCIDENT WAS WITNESSED BY A FELLOW DETAINEE, NAMED FARIBORZ, WHO SAID THE GUARDS WERE VERY ROUGH. "AUSTRALIAN OFFICERS CAME AND THEY GRABBED HIS HANDS. THEY GRABBED HIM IN SUCH A WAY AS IF THEY HAD ARRESTED A CRIMINAL FROM DAESH GROUP," HE SAID. "HIS SHOULDER BLADES WERE BEING BENT, BECAUSE THEY HAD PULLED HIS ARMS BEHIND HIM." FARIBORZ SAID NAURUAN POLICE ARRIVED SOON AFTERWARDS. "HIS ONLY OFFENCE WAS THAT HE WANTED TO SEE HIS SISTER FOR JUST FIVE SECONDS. AND HE KEPT BEGGING THEM," HE SAID. "NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE BEGGED THEM, THEY STILL DID NOT LET HIM SEE HIS SISTER, AND THEY TOOK HIM TO PRISON." GUARDS 'URINATED THROUGH BARS' OF CELL THE YOUNG MAN CLAIMS HE WAS PUT IN A CELL WITHOUT FURNITURE AND LEFT THERE FOR MORE THAN 30 HOURS WHILE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE CELL, INCLUDING GUARDS, URINATED THROUGH THE BARS. "I SLEPT ON THE URINE. BECAUSE OF SOME REASON THAT I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY, THEY URINATING INTO MY CELL AND I USED MY T-SHIRT FOR CLEANING AND MAKE IT DRY." SINCE THEN, HE HAS TOLD HIS STORY TO STAFF FROM THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, WHO WERE VISITING NAURU. THE MAN ASKED THE AGENCY TO INVESTIGATE AND SAID IT AGREED TO DO SO. HE SAID HE DID NOT COMMIT A CRIME AND NO CHARGES HAD BEEN LAID. "I JUST ASKED TO SEE MY SISTER BECAUSE SHE TRIED TO SUICIDE. BECAUSE WE ARE FAMILY. BECAUSE I'M HER BROTHER," HE SAID. "BECAUSE WHEN MY SISTER TRIED TO SUICIDE, IT'S NORMAL THAT I'M GETTING UPSET AND I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING." THE MAN SAID HE HAD BEEN AFRAID TO SPEAK PUBLICLY ABOUT THE MATTER UNTIL NOW. "ME AND MY FAMILY, WE ARE COMPLETELY ALONE HERE," HE SAID. NAURU OFFICIALS DENY ALLEGATIONS GREENS SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG HAS ALSO BEEN LOOKING INTO THE FAMILY'S STORY. "IF THERE IS ANY TRUTH TO THESE CLAIMS, THEY ARE ABHORRENT AND THEY NEED AND WARRANT AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FROM THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER," SHE SAID. "THIS FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH ALREADY". THE SENATOR CALLED FOR AN INDEPENDENT AUSTRALIAN INVESTIGATION INTO BOTH THE MAN'S COMPLAINT AND HIS SISTER'S ALLEGED RAPE. "I DON'T BELIEVE FOR A SECOND THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR (NAURU SECURITY COMPANIES) TRANSFIELD SERVICES OR WILSON SECURITY TO BE INVESTIGATING THEMSELVES. THIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY," SHE SAID. "WE KNOW THE RESULTS OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS MEANS THERE'S NO ACTION. THINGS OFTEN GET COVERED UP." A STATEMENT FROM THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT SAID THAT OPEN AND CONFIDENTIAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE IN PLACE FOR DETAINEES TO REPORT ANY CONCERNS THEY MIGHT HAVE. THE NAURUAN GOVERNMENT DENIED THE MAN'S ALLEGATIONS.

BY TERRY COLLINS @TERRYSCOLLINS SEPTEMBER 15, 2015 12:16 PM PDT UPDATED: SEPTEMBER 15, 2015 12:16 PM PDT TWITTER AND SQUARE HAVE CREATED A FEATURE TO MAKE DONATIONS DIRECTLY TO CANDIDATES THROUGH A TWEET. TWITTER TWITTER USERS CAN NOW DONATE CASH TO THEIR FAVORITE POLITICIANS IN THE US THROUGH A TWEET. THE SOCIAL NETWORK ANNOUNCED TUESDAY IT IS PARTNERING WITH MOBILE-PAYMENTS COMPANY SQUARE ON A FEATURE THAT LETS TWITTER'S USERS IN THE US CONTRIBUTE TO POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS VIA A TWEET. TWITTER SAID THE NEW FUNDRAISING FEATURE IS ONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS FOR USERS TO MAKE A DONATION ON A PLATFORM WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY FIERCELY DEBATING AND FOLLOWING THE 2016 ELECTION RACE. "WHEN PEOPLE HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT POLITICS, THEY HAVE THEM ON TWITTER," SAID THE COMPANY IN A STATEMENT. "IT'S WHAT VOTERS LEARN AND SHARE IN THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT ROUTINELY MOTIVATES POLITICAL ACTION. THAT'S WHY WE'RE MAKING IT EASIER FOR TWITTER USERS TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT CANDIDATES AND CAUSES." POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET MORE MOBILE DONATIONS FROM POTENTIAL VOTERS ON THE GO. IN THE PAST, IF CANDIDATES WANTED TO RAISE MONEY ON TWITTER, THEY WOULD PROVIDE A LINK TO THEIR WEBSITE, WHICH MEANT USERS WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THE SOCIAL NETWORK'S SITE TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN TWITTER AND SQUARE SHOULDN'T COME AS A SURPRISE. BOTH SAN FRANCISCO-BASED COMPANIES WERE CO-FOUNDED BY JACK DORSEY, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF SQUARE AND THE CURRENT INTERIM CEO OF TWITTER. THE NEW FEATURE COMES AS MANY INVESTORS WONDER WHETHER DORSEY COULD RUN BOTH COMPANIES IF HE IS NAMED PERMANENT CEO OF TWITTER. LAST WEEK, MAJOR TWITTER INVESTOR CHRIS SACCA TWEETED THAT DORSEY CAN HANDLE IT. RELATED LINKS MAJOR TWITTER INVESTOR SAYS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. HIRE A NEW CEO! WALL STREET PONDERS WHETHER TO FLY THE COOP ON TWITTER TWITTER WANTS A CEO WHO CAN MAKE A 'FULL-TIME COMMITMENT' "THE MARKET KNOWS THAT [DORSEY] HAS SUCH STRONG TEAMS AT BOTH [SQUARE] AND [TWITTER] THAT HE CAN RUN BOTH COMPANIES," HE SAID. "THIS IS SETTLED." WITH THE NEW FUNDRAISING FEATURE, CAMPAIGNS CAN SET UP AN ACCOUNT THROUGH SQUARE CASH TO ASK FOR AND ACCEPT DONATIONS THROUGH A UNIQUE LINK CALLED "$CASHTAG." WHEN USERS SEE A TWEET WITH A $CASHTAG, THEY CAN CLICK A "CONTRIBUTE" BUTTON TO MAKE A DONATION AFTER SUBMITTING THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION, REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION, AND PAYMENT PLAN. OF COURSE, USERS THEN HAVE THE OPTION TO TWEET OUT THEIR SUPPORT. AT LEAST A DOZEN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, INCLUDING DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS BERNIE SANDERS AND HILLARY CLINTON, HAVE STARTED USING THE NEW FEATURE, SAID NICK PACILIO, A TWITTER SPOKESMAN. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SCOTT WALKER AND MIKE HUCKABEE HAVE ALSO SIGNED ON. WALKER TOOK TO TWITTER ON TUESDAY ASKING FOR FUNDS PRIOR TO THE SECOND GOP PRIMARY DEBATE IN SIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA, ON WEDNESDAY. "SHOW SCOTT WALKER SOME SUPPORT GOING INTO THE SECOND DEBATE BY DONATING $2," THE TWEET READ. A TWITTER SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T GET A CUT OF THE DONATIONS, BUT SQUARE'S STANDARD DEDUCTION OF 1.9 PERCENT FOR EACH TRANSACTION APPLIES.

126	NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) - A MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER AND ROBBERY WILL NOW BE CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE STABBING DEATH OF HIS GIRLFRIEND. PORSCHA CLARK, A 26-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF THREE, WAS FOUND STABBED TO DEATH INSIDE HER APARTMENT IN THE TRINITY HILLS VILLAGE COMPLEX ON SUNDAY NIGHT. CLARKS BOYFRIEND, 03-YEAR-OLD SAMUEL COPELAND, WAS IDENTIFIED AS A POSSIBLE SUSPECT IN HER MURDER. INVESTIGATORS SAID COPELAND WAS INVOLVED IN AN OVERNIGHT HIT-AND-RUN CRASH IN WARREN COUNTY WHILE DRIVING CLARKS CAR. HE FLED INTO A NEARBY WOODED AREA AND WAS ARRESTED MONDAY MORNING FOR THE HIT-AND-RUN.  "I CAN SEE A FUTURE WHERE THERE WILL BE A LIGHT RAIL SERVICE ALONG CONSTITUTION AVENUE, IT WILL BE CONNECTED INTO A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL LINK MAJOR EMPLOYMENT AND RETAIL AND COMMERCIAL DESTINATIONS WITHIN OUR CITY," MR BARR SAID. METRO DETECTIVES TRAVELED TO MCMINNVILLE MONDAY AFTERNOON TO CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATION INTO CLARKS MURDER. EARLIER THIS MONTH, POLICE SAID CLARK SWORE OUT A MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC ASSAULT WARRANT AGAINST COPELAND, SAYING HE PUNCHED HER IN THE BACK OF HER HEAD AND FACE AFTER SHE DECLINED TO GIVE HIM A RIDE HOME FROM HER APARTMENT.  BEING A NICE PERSON MYSELF, ID ENJOY THE COMPANY. COPELAND FLED BEFORE POLICE ARRIVED. AT THE TIME, POLICE SAID CLARK DECLINED OFFICERS OFFERS TO ARRANGE FOR COUNSELING, SHELTER AND AN ORDER OF PROTECTION. THE DOMESTIC ASSAULT ARREST WARRANT ON COPELAND WAS STILL OUTSTANDING AT THE TIME OF CLARKS MURDER, DESPITE OFFICERS ATTEMPTS TO SERVE IT ON SEPT. 7. POLICE SAID CLARKS RELATIONSHIP WITH COPELAND APPARENTLY CONTINUED, WITH COPELAND REPORTEDLY PICKING UP ONE OF CLARKS CHILDREN FROM A CAREGIVER ON FRIDAY. CLARK AND COPELAND WERE ALSO REPORTEDLY SEEN ARGUING AT A NASHVILLE NIGHTCLUB OVER THE WEEKEND. COPELAND WAS CONVICTED OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN 1993 AND RECEIVED A 25-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. HE WAS ALSO CONVICTED OF ROBBERY THAT SAME YEAR AND RECEIVED A 6-YEAR SENTENCE. METRO POLICE ARRESTED HIM IN 4007 FOR PAROLE VIOLATION. COPELAND REGISTERED WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS AN EX-CONVICT IN 2012. HE WAS ARRESTED THE FOLLOWING YEAR FOR MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC ASSAULT AGAINST HIS GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME. THAT CASE WAS RETIRED IN GENERAL SESSIONS COURT IN NOVEMBER 2003. INVESTIGATORS SAID THEY WILL BE SEEKING A CRIMINAL HOMICIDE WARRANT AGAINST COPELAND IN CONNECTION WITH CLARKS MURDER. OUTSIDE CLARK'S APARTMENT TUESDAY WERE FADED CHALK DRAWINGS OF A TURTLE, A SUN, A SPIDER IN A WEB AND A GAME OF HOPSCOTCH.  DURING LAST 3 MONTH PERIOD, 3.38% OF TOTAL INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP HAS CHANGED IN THE COMPANY SHARES.  FOR US AN ACCENT CONTAINS REAMS OF UNSPOKEN INFORMATION ABOUT A PERSON (URBAN/RURAL, SOCIAL STATUS) ASIDE FROM THE LOCATIONAL INFORMATION. NEIGHBORS SAID THEY WOULD OFTEN STEP OUT, LOOK DOWN THE HALL AND FIND CLARK DRAWING WITH HER THREE CHILDREN. THEY SAID A LITTLE NOTE WRITTEN ON A WALL COULDN'T BE MORE TRUE, "LOVE WAS HERE." "THE DANGER IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIPS IS REAL," SAID TRACY DETOMASI OF YWCA NASHVILLE.  AT THE STATE LEVEL, CHARTERS AND TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS RECEIVE THE SAME AMOUNT. "A LOT OF TIMES, BECAUSE YOU LOVE THE PERSON AND YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH THEM, YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THEY CAN CHANGE. THEY WON'T DO THAT AGAIN. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE." "WE HAVE A CRISIS HOTLINE THAT'S 24 HOURS A DAY THAT THEY CAN CALL," DETOMASI CONTINUED. "THEY CAN CALL TO TALK. THEY CAN CALL TO GET A SAFETY PLAN. THEY CAN CALL TO GET INTO OUR SHELTER THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL.  MEANWHILE, SILHA IS GETTING A BAG PACKED SO THAT WHENEVER SHE GETS THE CALL, SHE CAN HEAD IN FOR THE SURGERY IMMEDIATELY.  7:10 GOAL SCORED GOAL! THE LOCATION IS CONFIDENTIAL. WE HAVE 51 BEDS, AND IT IS THE LARGEST IN TENNESSEE." YWCA OFFICIALS SAID WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS OUTREACH, LETTING OTHERS KNOW HELP IS AVAILABLE.  "WE DON'T JUDGE THEM WHEN THEY WANT TO TELL THEIR STORIES." FOR MORE ON THE YWCA, CLICK HERE.
127	THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE'S BLEND OF GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE-SECTOR EFFORT HAS HELPED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE, FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON SAID SUNDAY, HIGHLIGHTING THE PHILANTHROPIC NETWORK'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS AT A TIME WHEN HIS FAMILY'S CHARITABLE EFFORTS HAVE COME UNDER SCRUTINY. THE 10-YEAR-OLD INITIATIVE HAS FACILITATED PROGRAMS THAT AIDED MORE THAN 430 MILLION PEOPLE IN 180 COUNTRIES, WITH GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE AND CIVIL-SOCIETY ENTITIES WORKING TOGETHER IN 90 PERCENT OF THE PROGRAMS, HE NOTED AT THE INITIATIVE'S ANNUAL MEETING. "THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND IT OR QUESTION WHETHER IT'S A GOOD IDEA," THE DEMOCRATIC FORMER PRESIDENT SAID, BUT IT'S GOTTEN RESULTS. FORTY-SIX MILLION CHILDREN HAVE BETTER EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, MORE THAN 110 MILLION WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER IS MORE AVAILABLE TO OVER 27 MILLION PEOPLE, HE SAID. THE INITIATIVE GETS CORPORATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS TO CHANNEL MONEY INTO PROJECTS MEANT TO SOLVE INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS, WITHOUT DIRECT DONATIONS FROM ITS PARENT ORGANIZATION, THE BILL, HILLARY AND CHELSEA CLINTON FOUNDATION. THE FOUNDATION HAS RAISED MORE THAN $2 BILLION SINCE 2001 TO FIGHT POVERTY, GLOBAL WARMING, AIDS, CHILDHOOD OBESITY AND OTHER PROBLEMS. BUT AMID HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, THE FOUNDATION HAS FACED QUESTIONS THIS YEAR ABOUT FOREIGN DONORS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF ITS FUNDRAISING. THE CLINTONS HAVE DENIED ANY IMPROPRIETIES AND HAVE SAID THE CRITICISM AMOUNTS TO ELECTION-SEASON ATTACKS. THE FOUNDATION STOPPED RAISING MONEY FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS WHEN HILLARY CLINTON BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE IN 2009 BUT RESUMED AFTER SHE LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION IN 2013. THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID A REVIEW FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT DONATIONS TO THE FOUNDATION INFLUENCED ANY OF HER ACTIONS AS SECRETARY. AFTER ANNOUNCING HER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY IN APRIL, SHE RESIGNED FROM THE FOUNDATION'S BOARD AND THE FOUNDATION SAID IT WOULD STOP TAKING MONEY FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS EXCEPT AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND FOUR EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE FOUNDATION ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS WOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO SPONSOR EVENTS AT GLOBAL INITIATIVE MEETINGS, WHICH ARE NO LONGER BEING HELD OVERSEAS. THE INITIATIVE PRIDES ITSELF ON SOME 3,200 "COMMITMENTS TO ACTION" CONCRETE PLANS FOR A NEW APPROACH TO A MAJOR PROBLEM BY ITS MEMBERS. ONE SUCH PLEDGE HAS LED TO FINANCIAL EDUCATION FOR MORE THAN 1.2 MILLION POOR WOMEN AND YOUTHS AND SCHOLARSHIPS FOR MORE THAN 10,000 STUDENTS IN KENYA. ANOTHER HAS SPAWNED MORE THAN 430 SUCCESSFUL ONLINE CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGNS FOR PROJECTS CENTERED ON WOMEN AND GIRLS. A THIRD, AIMED AT ENLISTING AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHURCHES IN COMBATTING HIV AND AIDS, HAS TRAINED MORE THAN 500 RELIGIOUS LEADERS. "WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF DEFINING THE TERMS OF OUR INTERDEPENDENCE IN A WORLD WHERE SO MUCH OF OUR IDENTITY IS CAUGHT UP IN OUR DIFFERENCES," BILL CLINTON SAID. "SO OUR JOB, AS CITIZENS THOSE OF US WHO HAVE NO POLITICAL POWER IS TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO BUILD UP THE POSITIVE FORCES OF OUR INTERDEPENDENCE AND REDUCE THE NEGATIVE ONES."
128	GETTING CONNECTED IS FIRST STEP TO REDUCING WASTE AND ELIMINATING DOWNTIME TO CREATE THE FACTORY OF THE FUTURE WHERE MACHINES WORK EFFICIENTLY AND INTELLIGENTLY WITH INCREASED SPEED, LESS WASTE AND NO UNPLANNED DOWNTIME, GE AND CISCO HAVE TEAMED UP TO DEVELOP A SET OF BEST PRACTICES FOR DEPLOYING GES BRILLIANT MANUFACTURING SUITE WITHIN A MODERN CISCO IT ENVIRONMENT. THIS REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE FROM GE AND CISCO, ARCHITECTING A ROBUST MANUFACTURING NETWORK FOR THE INTERNET OF THINGS, PROVIDES A BLUEPRINT FOR COMBINING GES DIGITAL INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH WITH CISCOS FLEXIBLE AND HIGHLY-SECURE NETWORKING INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO CREATE A DIGITAL THREAD THAT WILL CAPTURE MACHINE DATA ON THE FACTORY FLOOR. THIS SOLUTION WILL MARRY GE MANUFACTURING SOFTWARE THAT PROVIDES REAL-TIME, ROLE-BASED DASHBOARDS TO DELIVER MORE PRODUCTS, FASTER AND WITH INCREASED QUALITY, WITH CISCOS HIGHLY SECURE, CONTEMPORARY NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY. IT WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR BRILLIANT MACHINES THAT COMMUNICATE, SHARE DATA AND INSIGHTS WITH OTHER MACHINES AND THE HUMANS THAT RELY ON THEM. IN ORDER TO START DOWN THE PATH TO BECOMING A BRILLIANT FACTORY, THE FIRST STEP IS TO DEPLOY A MODERN IT INFRASTRUCTURE, SAID JAMES BEILSTEIN, CIO FOR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING DEPLOYMENT FOR GES MANUFACTURING FACILITIES WORLDWIDE. THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WILL GIVE OUR PLANTS THE FLEXIBILITY AND SECURITY NEEDED TO DEVELOP A DIGITAL THREAD FROM PRODUCT DESIGN TO SHIPPING. CISCO IS PART OF GES BRILLIANT FACTORY ARCHITECTURE. MORE THAN EVER, MANUFACTURERS NEED TO FIND WAYS TO IMPROVE QUALITY, SPEED, AND UTILIZATION, AND THERE IS A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR REAL-TIME INSIGHTS ACROSS MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS, SAID KATE JOHNSON, CHIEF COMMERCIAL OFFICER FOR GE DIGITAL. FACTORY DIGITIZATION CAPABILITIES ARE IMPROVING, AND COMPUTE AND CONNECTIVITY PRICES ARE FALLING, BUT MANY COMPANIES ARE HAMSTRUNG BY LEGACY IT INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR JOINT GE-CISCO SOLUTION CREATES A STATE-OF-THE-ART JOINT INFORMATION AND OPERATIONS TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE NECESSARY FOR MACHINES TO ADAPT, PREDICT AND DIAGNOSE THEIR OWN FAILURE, DEPLOYABLE IN TODAYS REAL WORLD MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENTS. MANUFACTURERS ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP THEM TO ACHIEVE KEY OUTCOMES OF REDUCING DOWNTIME, AND INCREASING EFFICIENCY AND OUTPUT. IN ADDITION, THEY ARE FOCUSED ON INCREASING PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY, AND REDUCING ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND WASTE. GES BRILLIANT FACTORY SOLUTIONS USE BIG DATA, SOFTWARE, SENSORS, CONTROLLERS AND ROBOTICS TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND DELIVER ASSET AND OPERATIONS OPTIMIZATION. BASED ON A RECENT SURVEY, 47% OF MANUFACTURERS ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INDUSTRIAL INTERNET OF THINGS, SAID MATTHEW LITTLEFIELD, PRESIDENT AND PRINCIPAL ANALYST FOR LNS RESEARCH. GE AND CISCO CAN HELP ADDRESS THIS GAP WITH BEST PRACTICES FOR DEPLOYING A MODERN AND FLEXIBLE IP-BASED INDUSTRIAL NETWORKING INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS CAN BE USED BY MANUFACTURERS TO HELP ACCELERATE TIME TO MARKET, IMPROVE OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT THE CLOUD, BIG DATA ANALYTICS, AND SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS BEING DEPLOYED IN NEXT GENERATION MANUFACTURING. WE ARE HONORED TO BE COLLABORATING WITH GE TO ENABLE THEIR FIRST 100 BRILLIANT FACTORIES," SAID TONY SHAKIB, VP OF THE IOE VERTICAL SOLUTIONS GROUP AT CISCO. "MOVING DATA FROM MACHINES AND ASSETS ON THE FACTORY FLOOR THROUGH A HIGHLY-SECURE CISCO NETWORK AND EDGE COMPUTE WILL HELP PROVIDE A REPEATABLE AND SCALABLE REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE THAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE THE BLUEPRINT FOR GE'S BRILLIANT FACTORIES AND A MODEL FOR THE INDUSTRY. WERE EXCITED TO TAKE THIS IMPORTANT STEP TOGETHER AS TWO INDUSTRY LEADERS WORK TO MAKE THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) A REALITY IN MANUFACTURING." THIS GO-TO-MARKET PARTNERSHIP BUILDS ON GES AND CISCOS STRATEGY TO SEAMLESSLY CONNECT THE GROWING NUMBER OF MACHINES TO THE INDUSTRIAL INTERNET. LAST YEAR, GE AND CISCO ANNOUNCED THEY ARE INTEGRATING PREDIX SOFTWARE ON CISCO NETWORKING PRODUCTS TO ENABLE THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF ASSET PERFORMANCE AND OPERATIONAL DATA ANYWHERE IN THE NETWORK. ONE OF THE FIRST OF THESE DEVICES IS A PREDIX-READY CISCO ROUTER IN A RUGGEDIZED FORM-FACTOR FOR HARSH ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS OIL AND GAS FACILITIES. FOR MORE INFORMATION, CLICK HERE .

THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE IN THE PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL ROOM AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK, IN THE PRESENCE OF UCC VICE PRESIDENT, CAROLINE FENNELL. THE EXISTING JOBSIRELAND.IE WEBSITE, FIRST DEVELOPED IN THE LATE 1990S, IS THE LARGEST SUCH WEBSITE IN USE IN IRELAND WITH ALMOST 100,000 JOBS ADVERTISED IN 2014. ITS REPLACEMENT WILL IMPROVE SERVICES FOR JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS, INCLUDING: ENABLING JOBSEEKERS TO SUBMIT CVS AND APPLY FOR JOBS ON-LINE.

THE TNAISTE SAID: TODAY IS ABOUT UNLOCKING POTENTIAL - ABOUT TRANSFORMING JOBSIRELAND.IE INTO A CUTTING-EDGE SERVICE THAT WILL BENEFIT BOTH JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE AS WE SPEED UP PROGRESS IN TACKLING UNEMPLOYMENT. ITS ABOUT UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY PERSON ON THE LIVE REGISTER TO RETURN TO WORK AND BUILD A BETTER FINANCIAL FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES, AND THEIR FAMILIES, OVER TIME. THE GOVERNMENT IS DRIVING A JOBS-LED RECOVERY THAT IS NOW ADDING 1,300 JOBS A WEEK, AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN BY A THIRD SINCE ITS CRISIS PEAK. BUT WEVE MORE TO DO. AND BDO IRELAND AND THE HIRE LAB WILL HELP US DO THAT THROUGH THIS VERY IMPORTANT CONTRACT. COMMENTING ON THE PROJECT, DERRY GRAY FROM BDO IRELAND STATED HIS DELIGHT THAT THE INNOVATIVE APPROACH PROPOSED BY THE COLLABORATION OF BDO AND THE HIRE LAB, WAS SELECTED AS THE PREFERRED BIDDER. THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE OF BDO AND THE HIRE LAB, IS A COLLABORATION OF TWO INDIGENOUS IRISH BUSINESSES, WHO WILL PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH A 21ST CENTURY SOLUTION TO THEIR JOBS AND RECRUITMENT PLATFORM. BEING AWARDED THIS CONTRACT IS A POSITIVE ENDORSEMENT OF IRISH INNOVATION IN THIS EXCITING AREA. OUR TEAM LOOKS FORWARD TO DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISE TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH A SOLUTION THAT NOT ONLY SATISFIES BUT EXCEEDS ITS TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS NEEDS. MAURICE BUCKLEY, CEO OF THE HIRE LAB COMMENTED, "WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTION ON SUCH A STRATEGIC PROJECT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DEPLOYING OUR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENTS' JOBS MATCHING AND VACANCY SERVICE. SECURING A PROJECT LIKE THIS, ALLOWS US TO CREATE 25 HIGHLY SKILLED POSITIONS DOUBLING OUR WORKFORCE IN CORK OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS." ENDS NOTE FOR EDITORS ABOUT JOBSIRELAND AND THE NEW SERVICE WWW.JOBSIRELAND.IE IS A FREE ONLINE JOBS SITE DEVELOPED IN THE LATE 1990S THAT ENABLES EMPLOYERS TO POST JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBSEEKERS TO SEARCH AND APPLY FOR THESE OPPORTUNITIES ONLINE. IT IS THE LARGEST SUCH WEBSITE IN USE IN IRELAND WITH OVER 25,000 JOBS AVAILABLE AT ANY ONE TIME. THE NEW SERVICE, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO GO LIVE BY THE END OF MARCH 2016, WILL UPGRADE THE EXISTING JOBSIRELAND.IE SERVICE AND WILL INTRODUCE ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY TO THE BENEFIT OF JOBSEEKERS AND EMPLOYERS.

131	REVISE. DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, LATELY IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER.  IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT CLOSE TO TEN YEARS AND ICONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP.  THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES.  27 AT HOME AND LOSING 7-5 AT ALVA ON SEPT.17. CHRISTINE AND I HAD A FALLING OUT SOME TIME AGO AND ONLY RECENTLY RECONNECTED. DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST. ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN THOUGH RAOUL IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, I HAVE GOTTEN TO SEE A LOT OF HIS BAD SIDE (PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, SINCE I DONT TRUST MYSELF TO NOT BE BIASED), INCLUDING HIS (SEEMING) UNWILLINGNESS TO BE AFFECTIONATE EVEN IN A RELATIONSHIP HE INITIATES. IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL IN ONE OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER, THIS WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND RAOUL HAS SINCE CHANGED. ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?). I KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME; I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THAT. BUT I JUST CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. PART OF ME WONDERS IF IM BEING TOO CLINGY ABOUT THIS? ITS THEIR LIVES AND I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO GET IT IN PRACTICE. ANOTHER PART WONDERS IF IM BEING UNFAIR TO RAOUL? MAYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR THEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE. IVE THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW IM NOT AS BOTHERED AS I WAS INITIALLY. UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH.  WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO? SIGNED, OVERLY ANXIOUS FOR NO GOOD REASON

138	A MR FLUFFY HOMEOWNERS GROUP HAS REJECTED A PROPOSAL TO ALLOW AFFECTED BLOCKS TO BE SPLIT INTO TWO, DESCRIBING THE MOVES AS UNFAIR AND SUBJECTING CANBERRA SUBURBS TO RISK OF OVERDEVELOPMENT. HOMEOWNER ERIN HUNT, SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE MR FLUFFY FULL DISCLOSURE GROUP, TOLD A COMMITTEE CONSIDERING THE PLAN TO ALLOW DUAL OCCUPANCY ON LAND BOUGHT BACK BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT SPLITTING BLOCKS WAS AKIN TO "THROWING DARTS AT A MAP OF CANBERRA" UNDER THE GUISE OF MEANINGFUL GOVERNMENT PLANNING. SOME OF THE GROUP'S MORE THAN 400 MEMBERS BELIEVED DUAL OCCUPANCY WOULD WEAKEN QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CITY'S SUBURBS AND SEE SOME RESIDENTS LIVING WITHOUT ENOUGH SPACE, WHILE ALSO CREATING INCONSISTENT PLANNING RULES FOR PROPERTIES SIDE-BY-SIDE. "BASIC COMMON SENSE TELLS US THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE DIFFERENT RULES FOR BLOCKS WITHIN THE SAME ZONE," MS HUNT TOLD THE COMMITTEE'S FIRST PUBLIC HEARING. "IF THE PROPOSED CHANGES ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE ZONING OBJECTIVES THEN THE ACT GOVERNMENT SHOULD ABANDON THEM. THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION IS INDEFENSIBLE, WE BELIEVE. APPROVING THESE CHANGES COULD SET A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER [SUBURBAN ZONED LAND] OWNERS TO SEEK ADDITIONAL PERMISSIONS FOR THEIR BLOCKS." IN A SOMETIMES TEARFUL STATEMENT, MS HUNT SAID THE GOVERNMENT'S ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING DIRECTORATE HAD TOLD THE COMMITTEE THAT UNIT TITLES FOR SUBURBAN-ZONED HOUSES, KNOWN AS RZ1 BLOCKS, SUPPORTED A RANGE OF LOW DENSITY HOUSING CHOICES. "IF THIS ARGUMENT IS VALID, THEN WHY ARE THE PROVISIONS NOT BEING EXTENDED TO ALL RZ1 BLOCKS? THE DIRECTORATE FAILS TO EXPLAIN WHY IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THESE CHANGES TO BE MADE ONLY TO RZ1 FLUFFY BLOCKS AND NOT ALL OF THE RZ BLOCKS ACROSS THE CITY," SHE SAID. THE SUBURBAN ZONING COVERS MORE THAN 80 PER CENT OF ALL RESIDENTIAL LAND IN THE ACT BUT THE CHANGES ARE ONLY PROPOSED FOR BLOCKS BEING PURCHASED IN THE FLUFFY BUY-BACK SCHEME. THE ZONING ALLOWS FOR LOW RISE AND PREDOMINANTLY LOW DENSITY HOUSING, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE SINGLE RESIDENCES. THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSED THE TERRITORY PLAN CHANGE IN AN EFFORT TO MAXIMISE SALE PRICES FOR LAND FROM DEMOLISHED LOOSE FILL ASBESTOS HOMES, HELPING TO OFFSET THE COST OF BUYING AND DEMOLISHING MORE THAN 1000 CONTAMINATED HOMES. PLANNING OFFICIALS RECOMMENDED THE PLAN GO AHEAD BUT IT WAS SENT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION BY PLANNING MINISTER MICK GENTLEMAN IN JULY. MS HUNT SAID SUBURBAN INFILL AND INCREASED DENSITY REQUIRED BETTER CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES INCLUDING TRANSPORT, TRAFFIC, SCHOOLING, ACCESS TO AMENITIES AND SERVICES. "ECONOMIC OUTCOMES... MUST BE BALANCED WITH SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENT OUTCOMES. MR FLUFFY OWNERS ARE PART OF THE COMMUNITY, WE PAY OUR RATES, MOST OF US STILL LIVE HERE AND ALL OF THIS RELATES TO US AS PART OF THE COMMUNITY," SHE SAID. THE COMMITTEE ALSO HEARD EVIDENCE FROM MASTER BUILDERS ASSOCIATION DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MICHAEL HOPKINS, WHO SAID ALLOWING DUAL OCCUPANCY WOULD SEE MORE HOUSING STOCK BUILT IN THE CANBERRA MARKET, BENEFITING LOCAL BUILDERS AND WOULD HELP RELIEVE A "CHRONIC SHORTAGE" OF LAND FOR NEW HOMES. HE SAID CANBERRA WOULD BENEFIT FROM SENSIBLE AND MEASURED URBAN INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND MORE DIVERSE HOUSING STOCK. EVIDENCE WAS ALSO RECEIVED FROM THE WESTON CREEK COMMUNITY COUNCIL AND THE ACT HOUSING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. FLUFFY HOME AND WODEN COMMUNITY SERVICE DIRECTOR SAID ON WEDNESDAY THAT THE COMMUNITY RESPONSE TO THE BUY-BACK SCHEME HAD BEEN SIMILAR TO THE RESPONSE IN THE WAKE OF THE 2003 BUSHFIRES. "WHILE IT IS NOT AS APPARENT AS WITH THE FIRE WHERE YOU COULD SEE THE DEVASTATION AND THE LOSS OF HOMES I THINK THE CANBERRA COMMUNITY HAS RECOGNISED THAT IT IS A COMMUNITY ISSUE," HE SAID. "I AM QUITE AMAZED BY THE GENEROSITY CANBERRA COMMUNITY OF IN TERMS OF SEEING IT ENGAGE WITH THE RESPONSE OF HOME OWNERS." MR REDMOND, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ASBESTOS RECOVERY TASKFORCE, SAID THE TERRITORY HAD BEEN BRAVE IN LAUNCHING THE MASSIVE BUY-BACK SCHEME, AND TAKING ON LARGE FINANCIAL COSTS. THE COMMITTEE'S PUBLIC HEARINGS WILL CONTINUE NEXT WEEK.
139	NEW DELHI: MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS AND PLATFORM TICKETS WILL SOON GO PAPERLESS AS RAILWAYS IS PLANNING TO LAUNCH A MOBILE-BASED APPLICATION FOR THE SAME SHORTLY. PAPERLESS MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS AND PLATFORM TICKETS IN CITIES LIKE MUMBAI, DELHI, CHENNAI AND KOLKATA ARE TO BE LAUNCHED IN NEXT FEW DAYS, RAILWAY MINISTER SURESH PRABHU HERE TODAY SAID WHILE LAUNCHING THE PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING SYSTEM FOR DELHI-PALWAL SUBURBAN SECTION HERE. PRABHU ALSO LAUNCHED TWO OTHER IT-BASED INITIATIVES - CASH/SMART CARD-OPERATED TICKET-VENDING MACHINE AT THE NEW DELHI RAILWAY STATION AND A MOBILE APP FOR FREIGHT OPERATION MONITORING NAMED AS 'PARICHAALAN'. "THERE ARE ABOUT 75 LAKH PASSENGERS WHO USE MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS IN MUMBAI OUT OF OUR TOTAL 2.3 CRORE DAILY PASSENGERS," PRABHU SAID, ADDING, "SIMILARLY A GOOD NUMBER OF PASSENGERS TRAVEL ON MONTHLY SEASON TICKETS IN CHENNAI, KOLKATA AND DELHI ALSO." HE SAID THE MOVE TO GO PAPERLESS IS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S 'DIGITAL INDIA' INITIATIVE WHICH NOT ONLY SAVES THE USE OF PAPER BUT ALSO REDUCES THE LOAD ON BOOKING COUNTER. THE IT-BASED MOBILE APPLICATION FOR TICKETS WILL MAKE PAPER MANUFACTURERS UNHAPPY BUT PASSENGERS HAPPY AS IT WILL SAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR THEM, HE SAID. THE PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING SYTEM IN DELHI-PALWAL SECTION COVERS 11 STATIONS OVER 57 KM OF DISTANCE. THE APP, WHICH IS FOR BOTH ANDROID AND WINDOWS-BASED PLATFORMS, CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE OR WINDOWS STORE BY THE USER. THE APPLICATION PROVIDES NECESSARY ON-SCREEN ALERTS TO GUIDE THE PASSENGER DURING THE BOOKING PROCESS. PAYMENT FOR THE TICKET IS DONE THROUGH THE "RAILWAY WALLET" FEATURE IN THE APP. AFTER BOOKING THE TICKET, THE PASSENGER WILL GET TICKET CONFIRMATION SCREEN, WHICH WILL CONTAIN LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT THE TICKET. EARLIER, THE MOBILE APP FOR PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED BETWEEN EGMORE AND TAMBRAM SUBURBAN SECTIONS IN CHENNAI UNDER SOUTHERN RAILWAY ZONE ON A TRIAL BASIS IN APRIL. THEN IT WAS REPLICATED IN WESTERN RAILWAYS BETWEEN CHURCHGATE AND DAHANU SECTION. DEVELOPED BY THE CENTRE FOR RAILWAY INFORMATION SYSTEMS (CRIS) "UTSONMOBILE" - THE PAPERLESS UNRESERVED TICKETING FEATURE IN MOBILE APPLICATION AIMS TO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR PRINTING OF UNRESERVED TICKETS. PRABHU SAID RAILWAYS WILL SIGN AN AGREEMENT WITH ISRO FOR USING GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGY AND SATELLITE IMAGES IN THE RAIL SECTOR. AS PER PLAN, RAILWAYS WILL USE REMOTE-SENSING TECHNOLOGY AT UNMANNED LEVEL CROSSINGS TO WARN ROAD USERS AND ALSO FOR OTHER USAGE SUCH AS MAPPING OF STATIONS AND RAIL ROUTES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ISRO. HE SAID CASH/SMART CARD OPERATED TICKET-VENDING MACHINE (COTVM) WHICH WAS MADE OPERATIONAL AT THE NEW DELHI STATION WILL BE INSTALLED AT OTHER STATIONS ALSO. COTVM IS AN UNMANNED SELF-OPERATED KIOSK WHICH CAN BE USED BY PASSENGERS THEMSELVES TO BUY UNRESERVED TICKETS THROUGH CURRENCY/COINS AS WELL AS SMART CARDS. THESE KIOSKS HAVE EASY GRAPHICAL INTERFACE FOR TICKET TRANSACTION SO THAT THE USER CAN OPERATE THESE MACHINES. THE KIOSK ACCEPTS CURRENCY/COIN OF ALL DENOMINATIONS OF RS 5 AND ABOVE. THE MACHINE DOES NOT ACCEPT SOILED/CUT/GLUED/TAPED/COLORED NOTES AND ACCEPTS CURRENCY NOTES OF GANDHI SERIES. COTVMS AIMS TO REDUCE QUEUE LENGTH AT EXISTING TICKET COUNTERS BY PROVIDING AN ALTERNATE UNMANNED TICKETING SOLUTION AND MODE OF PAYMENT. PRABHU SAID BOTH PASSENGER AND FREIGHT BUSINESS ARE IMPORTANT FOR RAILWAYS AND THE 'PARICHAALAN' MOBILE APP FOR FREIGHT OPERATORS WILL HELP IN REAL-TIME DECISION-MAKING. 'PARICHAALAN', A USER-FRIENDLY APP, REPRESENTS DATA IN A PICTORIAL AND GRAPHICAL MANNER THAT IS EASILY COMPREHENSIBLE AND ALSO MAKES THE INFORMATION DYNAMIC AND CURRENT IN NATURE IN THE FREIGHT SECTOR.
140	THE IMPORTANCE OF FEE-PAYING STUDENTS GOES WELL BEYOND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL REVENUE. PHOTO: SEAN DAVEY PUBLIC UNIVERSITY INCOME FROM FEE-PAYING STUDENTS HAS SURGED SIX-FOLD OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, REACHING NEARLY $6 BILLION IN 2013. THE CHART BELOW SHOWS JUST HOW IMPORTANT FEE-PAYING STUDENTS HAVE BECOME TO AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITIES. MORE THAN 70 PER CENT OF FEES CAME FROM INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS, WHO PAY THE HIGHEST PREMIUMS TO ATTEND AUSTRALIA'S MOST 'PRESTIGE' UNIVERSITIES, ACCORDING TO A NEW GRATTAN INSTITUTE REPORT . INTERNATIONAL STUDENT NUMBERS HAVE DOUBLED SINCE 2001. LAST YEAR, ONE IN FOUR STUDENTS AT AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITIES CAME FROM OVERSEAS. THE FINANCIAL IMPORTANCE OF FEE-PAYING STUDENTS GOES BEYOND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL REVENUE, THE REPORT SAYS. THIS IS BECAUSE THEIR FEESGENERATE DISCRETIONARY REVENUE, WHICH UNIVERSITIES USE TO SUBSIDISE OTHER ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS RESEARCH. AND ALTHOUGH RESEARCH DOESN'T MAKE MUCH MONEY, IT IS CRITICAL TO A UNIVERSITY'S REPUTATION. IT INFLUENCES PEOPLE'S VIEW OFHOW PRESTIGIOUSTHE UNIVERSITY IS, WHICH IN TURN ALLOWS THE UNIVERSITY TO ADJUST ITS FEES ACCORDINGLY. AS THE CHART BELOW SHOWS, THE ELITE GROUP OF EIGHT (GO8) UNIVERSITIES, ALSO KNOWN AS THE SANDSTONE UNIVERSITIES, CHARGE THE HIGHEST FEES.IN SOME DISCIPLINES, THEY CHARGETWICE AS MUCH AS REGIONAL UNIVERSITIES.THEY ALSO PUBLISH THE MOST RESEARCH AND RANK HIGHESTON THE WORLD STAGE. TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITIES CHARGE THE NEXT HIGHEST FEES, FOLLOWED BY THE INNOVATION RESEARCH (IR) UNIVERSITIES. ALL STUDENTS PAY A PREMIUM TO ATTEND A GO8 UNIVERSITY, BUT INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS PAY THE HIGHEST PREMIUM. THE PAPER SUGGESTS A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY PRESTIGE MIGHT MATTER MORE TO INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. FIRSTLY, FEWER INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS END UP IN JOBS THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THEIR STUDIES. SECONDLY, VISA RESTRICTIONS MEAN THEY CAN ONLY WORK PART-TIME WHILE THEY STUDY, SO HAVE LESS OPPORTUNITY TODEMONSTRATESKILLS TO EXISTING EMPLOYERS. THIS IS WHENA UNIVERSITY'S REPUTATION HAS MORE TOBENEFIT, ACCORDING TO REPORT AUTHORS ANDREW NORTON AND ITTIMA CHERADTIDTHAM. ON THE OTHER HAND, DOMESTIC STUDENTS SEEM LESS CONCERNED WITH PRESTIGE, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT MANY DOMESTIC STUDENTS WITH ATARS THAT ARE HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE SANDSTONE UNIVERSITIES CHOOSE LESS PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES. THIS MAY BEBECAUSEAUSTRALIAN EMPLOYERS DON'T SEEM TOOFUSSED ABOUT WHICH UNIVERSITY DOMESTIC GRADUATES ATTENDED. FOR EXAMPLE, APREVIOUS GRATTAN INSTITUTE PAPER FOUND GRADUATING FROM A GO8 OR TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY PROVIDED A 6 PER CENT HIGHER LIFETIME INCOME OVER OTHER UNIVERSITIES. IN OTHER WORDS, MANYDOMESTIC STUDENTS DON'T PAY THE PRESTIGE PREMIUM SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO.
141	DARLINGTON-BASED MORTGAGE, PROTECTION AND WEALTH ADVISERS, I2I FINANCIAL PLANNING GROUP HASBECOME THE LATEST MAJOR APPOINTED REPRESENTATIVE (AR) FIRM TO JOIN MORTGAGE AND INSURANCE NETWORK, STONEBRIDGE GROUP. THE FIRMIS RUN BY DIRECTORS, MIKE DRAKE AND NIGEL WATERFALL-BROWN, AND ALONGSIDE ITS HEAD OFFICE IN DARLINGTON, IT HAS ADVISERS OPERATING FROM NUMEROUS SATELLITE OFFICES ACROSS THE NORTH EAST & EAST OF ENGLAND. THE BUSINESSFOCUSES PRIMARILY ON PROVIDING MORTGAGE AND PROTECTION ADVICE TO CLIENTS AND IS A TRADITIONAL, ADVICE-LED SERVICE BUSINESS WITH BOTH DIRECTORS, AND MOST ADVISERS WITHIN THE TEAM, HAVING MOVED TO I2I FROM A DIRECT SALES BACKGROUND. ITSAID IT CHOSE STONEBRIDGE GROUP BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF ITS OVERALL PROPOSITION FOR AR FIRMS, IN PARTICULAR THE WILLINGNESS OF THE TEAM TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND SOLUTIONS TO HELP ITS BUSINESS GROW. RICHARD ADAMS, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF STONEBRIDGE GROUP, SAID: 2015 CONTINUES TO BE A VERY STRONG YEAR FOR STONEBRIDGE GROUP PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF ADVISORY FIRMS THAT ARE CHOOSING TO JOIN OUR NETWORK. WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO WELCOME I2I, ITS DIRECTORS AND ADVISERS TO THE STONEBRIDGE FOLD AND WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER ON DEVELOPING THEIR EXPANSION PLANS FOR THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD. THE TEAM AT I2I APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY OUR FINANCIAL MODEL, THE SALES SYSTEM AND THE RANGE AND ACCESSIBILITY OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERING, WHICH HAVE ALL BEEN A KEY FOCUS FOR US OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TALKING TO NUMEROUS OTHER FIRMS ABOUT JOINING STONEBRIDGE AND HAVE AMBITIOUS PLANS WITH REGARD TO TAKING BOTH THE NETWORK AND OUR AR FIRMS FORWARD. MIKE DRAKE, DIRECTOR OF I2I FINANCIAL PLANNING, SAID: WE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF OPTIONS RECENTLY WITH REGARDS TO THE FUTURE OF I2I, ONE OF WHICH WAS TO BECOME DA HOWEVER HAVING SPOKEN TO THE DIRECTORS AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE PROPOSITION ON OFFER, WE DECIDED THERE WERE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR US IN CHOOSING TO REMAIN AN AR AS PART OF STONEBRIDGE. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS, NOT LEAST THE OVERALL OFFERING WHICH ALLOWS OUR ADVISERS ACCESS TO MORE PRODUCTS WHICH WILL ENSURE THEIR CLIENTS ARE BETTER PROTECTED. COMPARED TO OUR PREVIOUS NETWORK, THE COSTS INVOLVED IN JOINING STONEBRIDGE ARE MUCH LOWER AND IT DELIVERS A FAR BETTER SALES SYSTEM, REVOLUTION, WHICH SHOULD FREE UP TIME AND ALLOW MORE SALES. COUPLED WITH A FAR MORE PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO SALES QUALITY AND A FANTASTIC PROPOSITION INTO WHICH WE CAN RECRUIT, THIS MEANT WE WERE EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE WITH CHOOSING STONEBRIDGE, OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP AND ITS STRUCTURE. WE ARE NOW LOOKING AHEAD TO DEVELOPING OUR BUSINESS WITHIN THE GROUP. SHARE THIS: LIKE THIS: LIKE LOADING...

STILL, WHILE WERE HERE, LETS GIVE THE ANGRY BIRDS TRAILER A CLOSER LOOK. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST WE OPEN WITH A SHOT OF THE CHARACTER WERE MOST LIKELY TO REMEMBER FROM THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED ANGRY BIRDS SEVERAL YEARS AGO NAMELESS RED BIRD. HERES NAMELESS RED BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. SO FAR, THIS IS A FILM ABOUT A CARTOON BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST ALSO PRESENT, THREE SEXY BIRDS. AT LEAST I ASSUME THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY. GOD, I HOPE THEY ARE, OTHERWISE IVE JUST PROJECTING A HORRIFIC AMOUNT OF SEXUAL AVAILABILITY ONTO THREE RELATIVELY GENDER-FREE CARTOON BIRDS. NOT THIS WEEK, HERITAGE. DONT DO THIS WHILE NEBULOUS ALMOST-BESTIALITY IS SUCH A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE. GET IT TOGETHER. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, PHEW, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY AFTER ALL. AND THEY WERE AIMING ALL THEIR RED-HOT SEXUALITY AT THAT HUNKY SORT-OF BLUEISH BIRD. I HOPE THE RED BIRDS OK, AND DIDNT MISTAKENLY THINK THE OTHER BIRDS WERE ACTUALLY COMING ON TO HIM. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST AH. HE DID. AND BY THE LOOK OF IT HE HASNT TAKEN THE REJECTION WELL. IN FACT, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT HES NOW A FAIRLY ANGRY BIRD. SEE WHAT I DID THERE? THAT WAS CLEVER OF ME WASNT IT? SO ANGRY IS NAMELESS RED BIRD, IN FACT, THAT HE APPEARS TO HAVE ENROLLED IN SOME SORT OF ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME, ALONG WITH AN ANNOYING YELLOW BIRD PLAYED BY THE ANNOYING MAN WHO PLAYED THE ANNOYING SNOWMAN IN FROZEN.

143	AARON MARTIN OVERTHE PAST YEAR, PROVIDENCE HEALTH & SERVICES, A 158-YEAR OLD NOT-FOR-PROFIT CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, HAS QUIETLY BUILT A SOPHISTICATED VENTURE CAPITAL ARM THAT COULD PASS ASA FUND AT ANY LARGE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY. IN ADDITION TO THE $150 MILLION FUND, PROVIDENCE VENTURES EMPLOYS A STAFF OF ABOUT 100 EMPLOYEES, WHO WRITE CODE AND ARE TASKED WITH INVENTING IDEAS TOIMPROVE AND LOWER THE COST OF HEALTH SERVICES. DRIVING THE OPERATION IS NOT ONLY A PANEL OF HEALTHCARE EXPERTS, AS YOU MIGHT SUSPECT, BUT A-LIST TECHNOLOGISTS AND ENTREPRENEURS, WHO ARE GIVINGUP MORETRADITIONAL JOBS TO WORK IN A FIELD THATSNOTORIOUS FOR RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY. PROVIDENCE VENTURES IS RUN BY AARON MARTIN, A FORMER AMAZON EXEC WHO PREVIOUSLY BUILT THE COMPANYSSELF-PUBLISHING AND PRINT ON-DEMAND BUSINESS FOR KINDLE NORTH AMERICA. MORE RECENTLY,PROVIDENCE HIRED MIKE MCSHERRY, THE FORMER CEO OFSWYPE, WHICH FAMOUSLY BUILT A MOBILEKEYBOARD THAT ALLOWS YOU TO QUICKLY INPUT TEXT ON TOUCHSCREENS USINGYOUR FINGER. MCSHERRY LEFT NUANCE COMMUNICATIONS A YEARAGO AFTER IT ACQUIRED SWYPE FOR $100 MILLION IN 2011. MCSHERRY, A LONG-TIME ENTREPRENEUR, ALONG WITHA FEW OF HIS ORIGINAL TEAMMATESFROMSWYPE, ARE SERVING AS ENTREPRENEURS-IN-RESIDENCE AT PROVIDENCE, TASKED WITH COMING UP WITH THE NEXT BIG DEVELOPMENT IN HEALTHCARE. HOW IS PROVIDENCE ATTRACTING THIS TALENT? I WAS WORKING ON SOME REAL COOL STUFF FOR KINDLE WHEN I LEFT, BUT I FOUND MYSELF THINKING IN MY OFF CYCLES, WHAT COULD I DO WITH HEALTHCARE? I WAS WORKING ON SOME REAL COOL STUFF FOR KINDLE WHEN I LEFT, BUT I FOUND MYSELF THINKING IN MY OFF CYCLES, WHAT COULD I DO WITH HEALTHCARE?, SAID MARTIN, WHO WAS FIRSTINTRODUCED TO THE IDEA OF JOINING PROVIDENCE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO BY MIKE BUTLER, PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS AND SERVICES FOR PROVIDENCE HEALTH & SERVICES. WHAT GOT ME INTERESTED WASTHEMISSION. PROVIDENCE HEALTH & SERVICES EMPLOYS MORE THAN 76,000 PEOPLE, AND POSTS ANNUAL NET OPERATING REVENUE OF MORE THAN $12 BILLION. IT IS THE THIRD LARGEST NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTH SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES, OPERATING 34 HOSPITALS INALASKA, CALIFORNIA, MONTANA, OREGON AND WASHINGTON, INCLUDING SWEDISH MEDICAL CENTER IN SEATTLE. IT IS BIG, AND WITH THAT COMES BUREAUCRACY. BUT PROVIDENCE VENTURES IS LOOKING TO WIPE THOSE LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY AWAY THROUGHOUT HEALTHCARE, CREATING MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEMS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS. MIKE MCSHERRY (PHOTO VIA KAREN DUCEY) MCSHERRY SAID HE JOINED PROVIDENCE VENTURES BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGE AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT. OUR CHARTER IS TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE WORLD OF HEALTHCARE. ITS BASICALLY UP TO US TO DEFINE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE THINK ARE WORTH SOLVING, HE SAID. IT ALL COMES DOWN TO US COMING UP WITH AN IDEA THAT WE THINK IS WORTHY OF TACKLING. MCSHERRY FIRST GOT EXPOSED TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHILEON THE BOARD OFPACIFIC MEDICAL CENTER, AKA PACMED, WHICH IS THESEATTLE-BASED HEALTH SYSTEM KNOWN BY ITSDISTINCTIVE BEACON HILL TOWER. (ONLY BY COINCIDENCE IS THAT WHEREAMAZONS SEATTLE HEADQUARTERS WASLOCATED UNTIL RECENTLY.) PACMED AND PROVIDENCE FORMED A PARTNERSHIP A YEAR AGO AIMED TOIMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE,WHILE REDUCING COSTS. MARTIN SAID PROVIDENCE VENTURES GOALS CAME ABOUT DUE TO THE TREND IN HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS, IN WHICH PATIENTS HAVE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COST OF THEIR CARE. GIVEN THAT THEY PAY MORE OUT OF POCKET, PATIENTS HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHERE THEY GO, PROMPTING THEM TO COMPARISON SHOP FOR HEALTHCARE JUST LIKE THEY DO FOROTHER MAJOR PURCHASES IN THEIR LIVES. TO THAT END, MARTIN SAID ITS IMPORTANT FOR PROVIDENCE TO BE AHEAD OF THE CURVE, AND TO IDENTIFY THINGS THAT WOULD DISRUPT THE INDUSTRY BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOES IT. THE CONCEPT IS SIMILAR TO HIS ROLE AT AMAZON,WHICH WAS WILLING TO INTRODUCE THE KINDLE AND SELF-PUBLISHING, EVEN THOUGH IT HAD A GROWINGANDPROFITABLE PHYSICAL BOOK BUSINESS. IN THE PAST, HEALTHCARE HAS BEEN A B2BSYSTEM, MARTIN SAID. IN THE FUTURE, ITS GOINGTO BE A CONSUMER-FOCUSED BUSINESS. THEYLL BE ABLE TO VOTE AND CHOOSE.TO HAVE A SAY IN THE FUTURE, YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO DISRUPT YOUR OWN BUSINESSMODELS. THATS WHAT GOT ME INTERESTED IN THE COMPANY. SQORD RELOCATED TO SEATTLE AFTER PROVIDENCE INVESTED IN THEIR ACTIVITY TRACKER. AS PART OF THIS EFFORT TO DISRUPT THE INDUSTRY, PROVIDENCE VENTURES IS CURRENTLY PILOTING ABOUT A DOZENNEW TECHNOLOGIES WITH STARTUPS OR THROUGH ITS INTERNALCONSUMER INNOVATION GROUP. ONE PILOT PROGRAM COMING IN THEFOURTH QUARTER INCLUDES AN INTERNALLY-BUILT MOBILE APP THAT PROVIDES CONTENT TO WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT OR JUST DELIVERED A BABY. ADDITIONALLY, IT WILL PROVIDE LACTATION SUPPORT VIA VIDEO CHAT, NO MATTER WHEN THE MOTHERIS HAVING PROBLEMS. PROVIDENCE ALSO OPERATES AS A TRADITIONAL VENTURE FUND, AND HAS MADE ROUGHLY A HALF DOZEN INVESTMENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR. ONE EXAMPLE IS A COMPANY CALLED SQORD, DEVELOPER OF A WEARABLE DEVICE THAT HAS THEGOAL OF LOWERING CHILDHOOD DIABETES BY KEEPING KIDS ACTIVE. DURING A PILOT IN SNOHOMISH COUNTY, EVERY LOCAL FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADER GOTA SQORD AND PARTICIPATED IN A CHALLENGE TO INCREASE THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE COMPANY, WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN DURHAM, N.C., ULTIMATELY RELOCATED TO SEATTLE TO BE CLOSER TO PROVIDENCE. OVER THE PAST WEEK, PROVIDENCE HAS MADE TWO MORE INVESTMENTS: ONE ISSAN FRANCISCO-BASED OMADA HEALTH, WHICH IS DEVELOPING ADIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM USED BY PROVIDENCE HEALTH & SERVICES. IT RECEIVED $48 MILLION IN A THIRD ROUND OF FUNDING. IT ALSO INVESTED IN KYRUUS, WHICH RAISED $25 MILLION TO HELP PATIENTS FIND THE APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. MARK LONG, PROVIDENCES VP OF DIGITAL INNOVATION. YET ANOTHER AREA THAT MARTIN OVERSEES ISTHE DIGITAL INNOVATION GROUP, WHICH IS AN INTERNALLY FOCUSED SOFTWARE COMPANY. THAT GROUP IS LED BY MARK LONG, WHO IN ADDITION TO WORKING AT A HANDFUL OF HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, ALSO WORKED AT AMAZON FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. LONG IS IN CHARGE OF HIRING DEVELOPERS TO WRITE CODE, WITH THE GOAL OF HELPING EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES MORE EASILY INTEGRATE INTO PROVIDENCES PLATFORMS. ITS CONSIDERED A NECESSARY STEP SINCE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS ARE SO ARCHAIC, AND THEREFORE ARE DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH. IN ALL, PROVIDENCE VENTURES HAS100 EMPLOYEES TODAY IN SEATTLES BANK OF AMERICA TOWER, BUT MARTINBELIEVES THAT COULD DOUBLE OVER THE NEXT YEAR AS IT TACKLES THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMFROM ALL DIFFERENT ANGLES. HE SAID PROVIDENCE ISNT THE ONLY INSTITUTION THAT IS INVESTING IN THESE KINDS OF RESOURCES, WITH OTHER RECOGNIZABLE NAMES, LIKE STANFORD, JOHN HOPKINS AND THE MAYO CLINIC, ALSO BEING VERY PROACTIVE.

144	THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPPED BY NEARLY THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS BETWEEN 2013 AND 2104, ACCORDING THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, FROM 13.3 TO 10.4 PERCENT. PUT ANOTHER WAY, 8.8 MILLION MORE PEOPLE WERE INSURED IN 2014 THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. THE ANNUAL STUDY FROM CENSUS IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE MEASURE OF HEALTH INSURANCE, ALTHOUGH A CHANGE IN THE WAY HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED MAKE THIS YEAR'S REPORT COMPARABLE TO 2013 BUT NOT EARLIER YEARS. CENSUS OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT A DIFFERENT ANNUAL SURVEY THAT HAS ASKED HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THIS TO BE THE BIGGEST DROP IN THE UNINSURED SINCE AT LEAST 2008. OTHERS SAY THE SIZABLE INCREASE IN AMERICANS WITH INSURANCE DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL HEALTH LAW IS UNPRECEDENTED SINCE THE CREATION OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID 50 YEARS AGO. "IT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DROP EVER," SAID PAUL FRONSTIN, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH RESEARCH AT THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WHO HAS BEEN STUDYING THE UNINSURED SINCE 1993. MORE IMPORTANTLY, SAID DIANE ROWLAND, HEAD OF THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION'S COMMISSION ON MEDICAID AND THE UNINSURED, "THE GAINS ARE EXACTLY WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WERE," MEANING THE LARGEST INCREASES IN COVERAGE WERE IN THOSE GROUPS WITH TRADITIONALLY THE HIGHEST RATES OF UNINSURANCE YOUNGER, WORKING-AGE ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH LOW AND MODERATE INCOMES. (KAISER HEALTH NEWS IS AN EDITORIALLY INDEPENDENT PROGRAM OF THE FOUNDATION.) DESPITE THE GAINS, THE CENSUS STUDY FOUND THAT 33 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT INSURANCE. WHILE THE GAINS IN INSURANCE COVERAGE WERE WIDESPREAD, THEY WEREN'T EQUAL IN EVERY CATEGORY. NOT SURPRISINGLY, AMONG TYPES OF COVERAGE, THE BIGGEST INCREASES WERE IN PEOPLE COVERED BY MEDICAID (UP 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 62 MILLION PEOPLE) AND PEOPLE BUYING THEIR OWN HEALTH PLANS (UP 3.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 14.6 MILLION PEOPLE). EXPANDING MEDICAID AND MAKING PRIVATE INSURANCE EASIER TO PURCHASE BY THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER COVERAGE WERE KEY FOCUSES OF THE HEALTH LAW. BUT THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REMAINS EMPLOYERS. THAT NUMBER HELD STEADY AT AROUND 55 PERCENT. THE UNINSURED RATE DROPPED FOR EVERY AGE, INCOME AND ETHNIC GROUP AND IN EVERY STATE, ALTHOUGH, AGAIN, SOME GAINED MORE THAN OTHERS. THOSE AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE WERE MORE LIKELY TO GAIN INSURANCE THAN THOSE WITH MORE RESOURCES. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN $25,000 PER YEAR DROPPED 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE RATE FOR THOSE WITH INCOMES BETWEEN $25,000 AND $50,000 DROPPED 5 POINTS. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR THOSE EARNING MORE THAN $100,000 ANNUALLY DROPPED TOO, BUT BY LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT. SIMILARLY, THE UNINSURED RATE FOR THE WHITE NON-HISPANIC POPULATION (THE ETHNICITY MOST LIKELY TO HAVE INSURANCE) DROPPED BY JUST OVER 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS, WHILE THE RATES FOR BLACKS, ASIAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS DROPPED BY MORE THAN 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS EACH. AMONG STATES, MASSACHUSETTS (WHICH BEGAN REQUIRING MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE INSURANCE IN 2006) HAD THE LOWEST RATE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT COVERAGE, AT 3.3 PERCENT, WHILE TEXAS CONTINUED TO LEAD THE NATION WITH THE HIGHEST UNINSURED RATE 19.1 PERCENT. STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, HOWEVER, SAW OVERALL GAINS IN INSURANCE NOT JUST MEDICAID THAT WERE LARGER THAN THOSE THAT DIDN'T. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE WITH INCOMES ABOVE POVERTY BUT LESS THAN FOUR TIMES THAT (MOST OF WHOM AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID) STILL SAW AN OVERALL DECLINE IN UNINSURANCE OF 6.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, WHILE STATES THAT DIDN'T TAKE THAT OPTION SAW THAT RATE DROP BY ONLY 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

146	ARE YOU TEMPTED TO BUY A HIGH-SPEED BLENDER BUT APPREHENSIVE ABOUT MAKING THE FINANCIAL COMMITMENT? WE DONT BLAME YOU. HERE ARE FIVE QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF BEFORE YOU MAKE THE INVESTMENT. DEFINING HIGH SPEED THE SHORT AND SWEET EXPLANATION IS THAT HIGH-SPEED BLENDERS ARE JUST MORE POWERFUL. THE MOTORS HAVE MORE HORSEPOWER AND THE BLADES ARE MORE LEGIT. THEY ALSO TYPICALLY HAVE A LARGER CANISTER SIZE AND OFFER VARIOUS ACCESSORIES LIKE TO-GO CUPS AND TAMPERS TO HELP BLEND INGREDIENTS. QUESTION 1: ARE YOU A LOYAL SMOOTHIE MAKER? SERIOUSLY LOYAL? IF YOURE MAKING SMOOTHIES MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK AND USE A WIDE VARIETY OF COURSE INGREDIENTS LIKE SEEDS, VEGETABLES AND NUTS, THEN YOU WOULD PROBABLY BENEFIT FROM A POWERFUL BLENDER. QUESTION 2: CAN YOUR TRADITIONAL BLENDER KEEP UP WITH YOU? HAVE YOU GONE THROUGH A SERIES OF BLENDERS THAT HAVE QUICKLY BECOME BUSTED, BROKEN OR BURNED OUT? MANY DECENT QUALITY APPLIANCES CANT KEEP UP WITH A TRULY DEDICATED BLENDING ENTHUSIAST. IF THIS SOUNDS LIKE YOU, THEN THE ANSWER SHOULD BE GETTING CLEARER. QUESTION 3: DO YOU LIKE GETTING SAUCY? IF YOURE INTO MAKING SMOOTH SAUCES, SALAD DRESSINGS, VELVETY SOUPS AND EVEN THE OCCASIONAL FROZEN COCKTAIL, NOTHING DOES IT QUITE LIKE A HIGH-CLASS BLENDER. QUESTION 4: ARE YOU INTERESTED IN HOMEMADE FLOURS AND NUT BUTTERS? HIGH-POWDERED BLENDERS HAVE THE FUNCTIONALITY TO GRIND GRAINS INTO FLOURS AND NUTS INTO CREAMY BUTTERS. QUESTION 5: DO YOU LIKE TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX? ARE YOU INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA OF WHIPPING UP ICE CREAM, DAIRY-FREE MILK ALTERNATIVES AND WHOLE FRUIT JUICES, IN MINUTES? IF THE ANSWER IS YES, ITS TIME TO PULL THE TRIGGER. BRAND-NAME OPTIONS THE COST OF A HIGH-SPEED BLENDER CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM $200 TO MORE THAN $600. VITAMIX IS THE GOLD STANDARD, BUT ITS NOT YOUR ONLY OPTION. WOLF , BREVILLE , NINJA AND BLENDTEC BRANDS ALSO OFFER SOLID MODELS. THE BEST WAY TO FIND THE RIGHT BLENDER FOR YOU IS TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK, READ REVIEWS AND SHOP AROUND. SOME BRANDS EVEN SELL RECONDITIONED MODELS AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE.

147	THE OPENING DAY OF THE SAN MARINO GRAND PRIX SAW MIXED EMOTIONS FOR THE DRIVE M7 SIC RACING TEAM, WITH BOTH RIDERS EXPERIENCING A DIFFERENT START TO PROCEEDINGS. FEELING IN GOOD FORM ZULFAHMI KHAIRUDDIN PROGRESSIVELY BUILT HIS SPEED THROUGHOUT MORNING PRACTICE, POSTING HIS QUICKEST TIME ON HIS LAST LAP AND CONCLUDING THE SESSION IN 20TH POSITION. FREE PRACTICE TWO SAW THE MALAYSIAN RIDER CONTINUE TO PICK UP THE PACE AS HE FOCUSSED ON FURTHER ADAPTING HIS RIDING STYLE AROUND THE 4.2KM CIRCUIT. MAKING GOOD PROGRESS KHAIRUDDIN COMPLETED THE AFTERNOONS SESSION IN A RESPECTABLE 17TH PLACE, JUST 1.482S FROM FIRST PLACE MAN DANNY KENT. ALSO USING THE UPGRADED KTM CHASSIS, JAKUB KORNFEIL EXPERIENCED A DIFFERENT START TO HIS WEEKEND, AS HE RELENTLESSLY BATTLED WITH THE NEW SET-UP OF HIS #84 MACHINE. DESPITE HIS DETERMINED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE, THE CZECH RIDER WAS OVERCOME WITH TECHNICAL ISSUES, ENDING THE DAY IN 28TH POSITION. BIKE #63 ZULFAHMI KHAIRUDDIN FP1: P20; 145.072 (DRY) 19 LAPS FP2: P17; 144.579 (DRY) 17 LAPS I THINK TODAY WE CAN BE HAPPY WITH THE BIKE BECAUSE IN THE SECOND PRACTICE I FELT A BIG IMPROVEMENT FROM FP1. STILL WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE SET-UP, SO HOPEFULLY TOMORROW WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE ANOTHER STEP. WE ARE LOOKING FOR AT LEAST ONE SECOND MORE BECAUSE WE KNOW EVERYONE WILL GO FASTER AGAIN. MY MAIN DIFFICULTY TODAY WAS TURN TWELVE, WHICH IS WHERE I LOST THE MOST TIME, SO I WILL HAVE A LOOK AT THE DATA AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO GO FASTER, BUT FOR SURE ONE SECOND IS NECESSARY. BIKE #84 JAKUB KORNFEIL FP1: P16; 144.942 (DRY) 17 LAPS FP2: P28; 145.145 (DRY) 16 LAPS TODAY I MADE ONLY ONE FAST LAP WHICH WAS AT THE END OF THE FIRST PRACTICE, THE REST OF THE TIME WE WERE JUST TRYING TO FIND OURSELVES IN A BETTER CONDITION. OF COURSE I WANTED TO BE MUCH FASTER BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE. THIS WEEKEND WE HAVE AN UPGRADE FROM KTM, A NEW FRAME AND A NEW SWING-ARM BUT UNFORTUNATELY ITS NOT WORKING FOR US AT THE MOMENT. WE NEED MORE TIME TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE BIKE; TODAY WE TRIED EVERYTHING FOR THE AFTERNOON PRACTICE BUT STILL WE COULDNT MAKE ANY PROGRESS. THIS IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT WE HAD; WE ALSO HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE CLUTCH AND POSSIBLY SOMETHING WITH THE ENGINE, SO WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS AND WHY MY BIKE DOESNT WANT TO STOP. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE MUST LOOK INTO; FOR TOMORROW WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING. NOW WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER WITH KTM TO FIND A SOLUTION. THE TIME THAT I DID TODAY WAS MY MAXIMUM BUT I KNOW WE ARE CAPABLE OF MUCH MORE. TOMORROW WE HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE BEFORE THE QUALIFYING AND THEN IN THE QUALIFYING WE HAVE TO BE WITHIN OUR TARGET OF THE TOP FOUR ROWS. THIS IS OUR FOCUS AND THIS IS WHAT WE WILL BE WORKING EVEN HARDER FOR.

149	WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT O RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO? SIGNED, OVERLY ANXIOUS FOR NO GOOD REASON DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, LATELY IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER.  THE AID HAS FLOWN UNINTERRUPTED EVEN THOUGH TALIBAN OPERATING FROM PAKISTAN ATTACKED AMERICAN TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN.  THE TWO WOMEN HAD BOTH BEEN ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH ZOOKEEPER ADAM DAVIES - WHO HAD DATED MISS SANDERS FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE STARTING A RELATIONSHIP WITH MISS WESTLAKE. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS (LETS CALL THEM RAOUL AND CHRISTINE, FOR CONVENIENCES SAKE) THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND RECENTLY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP. IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT CLOSE TO TEN YEARS AND I CONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP. RAOUL, IVE KNOWN FOR ALMOST AS LONG, BUT WE LIVE IN THE SAME CITY AND HANG OUT OCCASIONALLY. THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES.  THEIR LIDS HAVE A COMMEMORATIVE INSCRIPTION AND THE SIDES BEAR THE PAPAL COAT OF ARMS AND THE SEAL OF THE ARCHDIOCESE. CHRISTINE AND I HAD A FALLING OUT SOME TIME AGO AND ONLY RECENTLY RECONNECTED. DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST.  IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL IN ONE OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS.  WE WOULD TALK BY TELEPHONE, SAID WATSON.  THE COURSE IS 6:30-8:30 P.M. HOWEVER, THIS WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND RAOUL HAS SINCE CHANGED. ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?). I KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME; I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THAT. BUT I JUST CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.  ITS THEIR LIVES AND I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO GET IT IN PRACTICE.  THE FINNISH AUTHORITIES AND ALL THE TREE-HUGGING HUMANISTS SHOULD VISIT COENHAGEN AND MALMO AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT AN OPEN-DOOR IMMIGRATION POLICY REALLY MEANS, THOUGHT ESKO.  GE, FOUNDER OF HALFPRICESOFT.COM. ANOTHER PART WONDERS IF IM BEING UNFAIR TO RAOUL? MAYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR TEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE.  UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH. I STILL CANT FULLY COME TO TERMS WITH IT AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS BETTER THAN THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY I CANT JUST LIVE AND LET LIVE?

151	AS PERSONAL AND MOBILE VIDEO ENDPOINTS FILL THE ENTERPRISE, COMPANIES NEED TO RETHINK HOW THEY BUY VIDEO CONFERENCE INFRASTRUCTURE. ENTERPRISE VIDEO CONFERENCING HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 30 YEARS, TRADITIONALLY SOLD IN THE BUSINESS MODEL ESTABLISHED LONG AGO AS MARCO POLO CARRIED OILS TO CHINA -- PURCHASE THE PRODUCT AND PAY THE SELLER UPFRONT, THEN BUY A MONTHLY MAINTENANCE CONTRACT. BUT CHANGE IS UNDERWAY. THE TRADITIONAL VIDEO CONFERENCING SALES MODEL WAS UNIVERSAL, COVERING BOTH VIDEO ENDPOINTS AND VIDEO INFRASTRUCTURE, WHETHER HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE. THE APPROACH MADE BUDGETING EASY, SINCE COSTS WERE KNOWN AND GENERALLY FIXED. BUT THE HIGH COST OF VIDEO INFRASTRUCTURE COMBINED WITH AN ENTERPRISE'S UNCERTAIN FUTURE CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS COULD LEAD TO DIFFICULTIES. EXACERBATING THE CAPACITY-PLANNING CHALLENGE FOR ENTERPRISES WAS THE PROBLEM THAT VIDEO INFRASTRUCTURE TRADITIONALLY SHIPPED IN QUANTIZED FORMATS. IF A COMPANY FOUND THAT USAGE EXCEEDED THE CAPACITY OF ITS 16-PORT MCU BY A PORT OR TWO, IT WOULD BE FORCED TO BUY AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OR 16 PORTS, OR EVEN INVEST IN A CHASSIS UPGRADE, DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE VENDOR. ALTERNATIVELY, MANY ENTERPRISES FOUND THEMSELVES BUYING A 24-PORT MCU FROM THE START EVEN WHEN 16 PORTS APPEARED TO BE SUFFICIENT. IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, HOWEVER, MULTIPLE VIDEO CONFERENCING VENDORS HAVE ADDRESSED THE COST, FLEXIBILITY, AND BUSINESS MODELS ASSOCIATED WITH INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS. THEY'VE TACKLED THESE IN THREE INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENTS. INFRASTRUCTURE AS SOFTWARE - WHILE GATEWAYS, GATEKEEPERS, AND OTHER VIDEO INFRASTRUCTURE DEVICES HAVE MOVED FROM DEDICATED HARDWARE PLATFORMS TO SOFTWARE RUNNING ON INDUSTRY-STANDARD PHYSICAL AND VIRTUAL SERVERS, MOST ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE SOFTWARE MCU (VIDEO BRIDGE). THE EXCITING NEWS AROUND THE SOFTWARE MCU IS THAT 1) SOFTWARE LICENSE UPGRADES ARE POSSIBLE IN UNITS OF ONE; 2) PERFORMANCE HAS GROWN TO EQUAL THAT OF THE TIME-HONORED HARDWARE MCU; AND 3) FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS ARE A SIMPLE MATTER OF PROGRAMMING. THE FORKLIFT UPDATE IS GONE. THE LESS EXCITING NEWS IS THAT COST SAVINGS HAVE HAD MINIMAL IMPACT FOR ENTERPRISES, AT LEAST TO DATE. WAINHOUSE RESEARCH (WR) ESTIMATES THAT THE SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS ARE LESS THAN 15% OF THE MARKET. INFRASTRUCTURE AS A CLOUD SERVICE - THE TYPICAL CASE HERE INVOLVES ENTERPRISES BUYING THEIR OWN ROOM VIDEO SYSTEMS, DEPLOYING A VARIETY OF CLIENT- AND BROWSER-BASED DESKTOP AND MOBILE DEVICES, AND THEN USING CLOUD SERVICES FOR POINT-TO-POINT AND MULTIPOINT CALLS. THEY SAVE LOTS OF MONEY ON INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE, BUT PAY SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR THE CLOUD OR HOSTED SERVICES. BLUE JEANS NETWORK MADE A BIG SPLASH WHEN IT RELEASED ITS VIDEO CONFERENCING AS A SERVICE (VCAAS) OFFERING SEVERAL YEARS AGO, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE WAS OFTEN LESS THAN WHAT AN ENTERPRISE PAID FOR TRADITIONAL BRIDGE MAINTENANCE. THE COMPANY NOW FACES SCORES OF COMPETITORS, YET WR SURVEY RESULTS SUGGESTS THAT ONLY 20% OF VIDEO CONFERENCING CUSTOMERS ARE CURRENTLY USING A CLOUD SERVICE FOR VIDEO, WITH A SIMILAR NUMBER LOOKING TO EXPAND THEIR USE OF VCAAS WITHIN A YEAR. BUSINESS MODEL ADJUSTMENTS - SEVERAL VENDORS HAVE INTRODUCED NEW COST MODELS FOR THEIR VIDEO INFRASTRUCTURE BASED ON PRICE PER USER PER MONTH. SO RATHER THAN HAVING A VCAAS SOLUTION, THE ENTERPRISE CAN HAVE A DEVICE ON ITS OWN NETWORK AND PAY "BY THE DRINK." FOR THE ENTERPRISE, THIS APPROACH GENERALLY ELIMINATES 1) UPFRONT CAPITAL EXPENSES; 2) THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CAPACITY PLANNING FOR UNKNOWN USAGE; AND 3) BANDWIDTH CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE USERS NEEDING TO ACCESS INFRASTRUCTURE LOCATED IN THE CLOUD. FOR THE VENDOR, THE PER-USER/PER-MONTH MODEL PROVIDES A SMOOTH ANNUITY REVENUE STREAM RATHER THAN LUMPY ONE-TIME SALES. EVERYONE BENEFITS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT DESPITE THE HYPE, NOBODY IS REALLY BUYING THE STORY. LARGE ENTERPRISES, IT TURNS OUT, ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE BUYING MODEL AND FIXED BUDGET CERTAINTIES FROM THE GOOD OLD DAYS. AND SMALL ENTERPRISES DON'T BUY VIDEO INFRASTRUCTURE, PERIOD; THEY LOOK TO CLOUD OFFERINGS, INCLUDING MANY THAT ARE NOW FREE. BUT IT IS TIME TO RETHINK THOSE STRATEGIES AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND MARKET OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR VIDEO INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS RETHINK IS A NECESSITY AS ENTERPRISES FACE A FUTURE IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF TRADITIONAL ROOM SYSTEMS ARE BEING AUGMENTED WITH THOUSANDS OR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PERSONAL AND MOBILE VIDEO ENDPOINTS. WITH TRADITIONAL ROOM SYSTEMS, THE INDUSTRY RATIO FOR MCU PORTS TO ENDPOINTS WAS TYPICALLY 1:4; FOR HUDDLE ROOMS AND PERSONAL VIDEO, THE RATIO IS LIKELY TO VARY FROM 1:20 TO 1:400, DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY. UNCERTAINTY REIGNS. FLEXIBILITY IS THEREFORE THE KEY. FORTUNATELY, ENTERPRISES CAN NOW BUY BOTH PREMISES-BASED INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLOUD SERVICES VIA BUSINESS MODELS THAT MEET THIS NEED. IT IS HIGH TIME FOR ENTERPRISES TO MAKE THE SWITCH AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS MODEL TO A NEW ONE.

153	ONTARIO DOCTORS WARN THAT PATIENTS WILL HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CUTTING THEIR FEES. THE GOVERNMENT IS CHOPPING FEES BY 1.3 PER CENT STARTING NEXT WEEK TO KEEP THE PROFESSION WITHIN AN ALLOTTED $11.6-BILLION BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. DR. MICHAEL TOTH, PRESIDENT OF THE ONTARIO MEDICAL ASSOCIATION , SAYS THE PROFESSION IS FRUSTRATED AND SOME MEMBERS ARE TALKING ABOUT LEAVING THE PROVINCE OR RETIRING EARLY. "IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PATIENTS ULTIMATELY," HE WARNED, NOTING THAT SOME PHYSICIANS WILL BE FORCED TO LAY OFF STAFF AND CUT OFFICE BUDGETS. PHYSICIANS ARE VENTING THEIR ANGER ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ON TWITTER , HARDLINERS ARE THREATENING JOB ACTION SUCH AS A WORK-TO-RULE CAMPAIGN, HOUR CUTBACKS AND CANCELLATION OF FLU-SHOT CLINICS. TOTH SAID THE OMA, WHICH REPRESENTS 28,000 MEMBERS, WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH GOVERNMENT AND IS CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION. HEALTH MINISTER ERIC HOSKINS SAID HE WANTS TO REASSURE ONTARIANS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERVICE CUTS.  "WE ARE NOT A BANK," SAID PATRICK POUYANN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FRENCH OIL GIANT TOTAL SA, WHICH HAS A LARGE TRADING ARM. "MY CONCERN IS THAT A PERCEPTION IS BEING PROPAGATED THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE CHALLENGING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE FACTS SIMPLY DON'T BEAR THIS OUT," HE SAID. ONTARIO DOCTORS ARE AMONG THE BEST PAID IN CANADA WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF ABOUT $350,000, AN AMOUNT THAT HAS GROWN BY 60 PER CENT OVER THAT LAST DECADE, HOSKINS SAID. FROM THAT, PHYSICIANS PAY OVERHEAD COSTS, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE WAGES AND OFFICE RENT, AN AMOUNT WIDELY QUOTED AS ABOUT 30 PER CENT. HOSKINS SAID PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED OVER WHAT IS A DISPUTE OVER REMUNERATION: "I HAVE RECEIVED ASSURANCE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE OMA THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE ACTION THAT WILL IMPACT THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY PROVIDE OR PATIENT SAFETY. I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD." THE RIFT DATES BACK TO A PAYMENT SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT UNILATERALLY IMPOSED LAST JANUARY AFTER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OMA ENDED IN AN IMPASSE. IT INCLUDED A 2.65 PER CENT FEE CUT AND A CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IF DOCTORS' OHIP BILLINGS WERE TAKING DOCTORS OVER THEIR $11.6-ALLOTMENT. THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENT MODEL ALLOWS DOCTORS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPENSATION. IF THEY SEE MORE PATIENTS AND PERFORM MORE PROCEDURES, THEY CAN BILL THE PUBLIC INSURANCE PLAN FOR MORE MONEY. THE PAYMENT SCHEME ALSO INCLUDES INCREASES OF 1.25 PER CENT IN THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES BUDGET FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE ANNUAL INCREASES ARE INTENDED TO MEET A RISE IN DEMAND FROM A GROWING AND AGING POPULATION AND THE ADDITION OF 700 NEW DOCTORS. BUT THE OMA CONTENDS INCREASES OF 2.7 PER CENT ARE NEEDED IN EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND GROWTH. THE OMA IS LOBBYING MPPS, HOLDING TOWN HALL MEETINGS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE PROVINCE AND STAGING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH MEMBERS NEXT WEEK. TOTH ARGUED THERE IS A "POWER IMBALANCE" WITH GOVERNMENT AND CALLED FOR A NEUTRAL THIRD-PARTY TO WEIGH IN WITH A BINDING DECISION: "WE ARE LOOKING TO RESOLVE THIS ... WE THINK THE WAY TO DO THIS IS MEDIATION-ARBITRATION."

155	WIENER & KRAUT DAY IS A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT THIS YEAR TO LYNDY SILHA OF WATERLOO. FOR HER, PROCEEDS FROM A RUMMAGE SALE COULD HELP GET HER A NEW LIVER, AND A SECOND CHANCE ON LIFE. ITS SCARY AND WONDERFUL ALL AT THE SAME TIME, SHE SAID. SILHA WAS BORN AND RAISED IN WATERLOO, GRADUATING FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL IN 1991. IN 2004, SILHA WAS DIAGNOSED WITH NASH LIVER DISEASE, A DISEASE CAUSED BY A BUILD-UP OF FATTY TISSUE AROUND HER LIVER. HOWEVER, SHE EXPERIENCED FEW ISSUES UNTIL NOVEMBER OF 2014. AT THAT POINT, HER LIVER REACTED TO SOME OTHER MEDICAL TREATMENT, CAUSING FLUID TO BACK UP INTO HER ABDOMEN A CONDITION KNOWN AS ASCITES . CURRENTLY, SILHA HAS A SHUNT IN HER LIVER, AND HAS TO GO APPROXIMATELY EVERY OTHER WEEK TO HAVE THE FLUID DRAINED FROM HER ABDOMEN. SHE SAID THAT AND MEDICATION IS ALL THE DOCTORS ARE ABLE TO DO UNTIL SHE CAN GET A NEW LIVER.SHE WAS PUT ON THE WAITING LIST A MONTH AGO. SHE SAID HER DOCTOR TOLD HER THAT THE WAIT COULD BE ANYWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND SIX MONTHS, CONSIDERING HER BLOOD TYPE. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO WAY TO BE SURE. MEANWHILE, SILHA IS GETTING A BAG PACKED SO THAT WHENEVER SHE GETS THE CALL, SHE CAN HEAD IN FOR THE SURGERY IMMEDIATELY. MY QUALITY OF LIFE IS NOT GOOD, CURRENTLY, SHE SAID. ALTHOUGH HER PARENTS LIKE TO TRAVEL, SILHAS MOTHER, VALERY SILHA, SAID SHE AND HER HUSBAND STAY HOME NOW, IN ORDER TO BE AVAILABLE WHEN THEIR DAUGHTER NEEDS THEM. IT JUST KEEPS US CLOSER TO HOME, VALERY SAID. I HAVE A REALLY NICE SUPPORT NETWORK SYSTEM, SILHA SAID OF HER PARENTS AS WELL AS OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS WHO HAVE SUPPORTED HER THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. SILHA CANNOT DRIVE, SO HER MOTHER TAKES HER TO MOST APPOINTMENTS. SHE HAS BEEN HOSPITALIZED NINE TIMES SINCE DECEMBER, SHE SAID. THE SILHAS ARE STILL ACCEPTING DONATIONS FOR THE BENEFIT RUMMAGE SALE TO BE HELD ON WIENER & KRAUT DAY AT K&B AUTO. THEY WILL TAKE ANYTHING BUT CLOTHES, SO LONG AS IT IS IN GOOD CONDITION. THOSE INTERESTED CAN CALL EITHER 920-675-6546 OR 920-675-6547 (LARRY OR VALERY SILHA) TO ARRANGE DROP-OFF, OR THEY CAN TAKE IT TO ST. PAULS LUTHERAN CHURCH BETWEEN 9 A.M. AND NOON, MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. FOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT THE LIBRARY AND ASK FOR STEPHANIE. VALERY SAID MONETARY DONATIONS ARE ALSO WELCOME.
156	BY BEN LEVISOHN STOCKS BATTLED BACK IN A BIG WAY TODAY. EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY THE S&P 500 ROSE 2.5% TO 1,969.41, THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ADVANCED 390.30 POINTS, OR 2.4%, TO 16.492.68 AS ALL 30 STOCKS IN THE BLUE-CHIP BENCHMARK FINSIHED HIGHER, AND THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE GAINED 2.7% TO 4,811.93. PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE, ONLY 12 OF THE STOCKS IN THE S&P 500 FINISHED IN THE RED TODAY. THE FOLKS AT BESPOKE INVESTMENT GROUP MARVEL AT THE SHEER NUMBER OF SUCH ALL OR NOTHING DAYS: LONG TERM CLIENTS OF BESPOKE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH OUR TERM ALL OR NOTHING DAYS, BUT FOR THOSE THAT ARENT, AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY IS A DAY WHERE THE NET ADVANCE/DECLINE READING FOR THE S&P 500 (NUMBER OF ADVANCERS ON A DAILY BASIS MINUS NUMBER OF DECLINERS) IS ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400. SINCE THE SELL-OFF REALLY BEGAN IN EARNEST ON 8/20/15, THE S&P 500S DAILY ADVANCE/DECLINE READING HAS BEEN ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400 ON EIGHT TRADING DAYS THROUGH FRIDAY (AS OF 2PM MONDAY, THE S&P 500S A/D READING IS CURRENTLY ABOVE +400 AGAIN). TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, PRIOR TO 8/20 THERE HAD ONLY BEEN 13 TRADING DAYS IN ALL OF 2015 WHERE THE S&P 500 HAD AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY. WE LOOKED TO SEE HOW COMMON IT HAS BEEN TO SEE EIGHT ALL OR NOTHING DAYS OVER A TWELVE TRADING DAY PERIOD, AND FOUND THAT SINCE OUR DAILY BREADTH DATA BEGINS IN 1990, THESE EVENTS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY RARE. IN FACT, THE ONLY TWO PERIODS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE WAS DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN LATE NOVEMBER/EARLY DECEMBER 2008 (WHERE WE SAW FIVE STRAIGHT DAILY OCCURRENCES) AND ON ONE DAY DURING THE 2011 CORRECTION ON 10/6/11. BMOS BRIAN BELSKI ARGUES THAT S&P 500 FUNDAMENTALS WEATHERED THE STORM: DESPITE A DIFFICULT MONTH FOR STOCK PRICES, UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS REMAINED LARGELY INTACT ACCORDING TO OUR MODELS. AS A RESULT, WE VIEW THE RECENT WEAKNESS AS MORE TECHNICAL IN NATURE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT U.S. ECONOMIC DATA CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. ONE SILVER LINING OF THE RECENT PLUNGE WAS THAT S&P 500 VALUATION REGISTERED ONE OF THE LARGEST MONTHLY CONTRACTIONS OF THIS BULL MARKET. HOWEVER, VALUATION REMAINS ELEVATED FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, BUT HAS RETREATED FROM ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVELS. BY CONTRAST, EARNINGS-RELATED DATA CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OVERALL FUNDAMENTAL LEVELS AND ESPECIALLY REVISIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPROVING SHARPLY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. IN FACT, OUR FUNDAMENTAL COMPOSITE HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT AFTER BOTTOMING EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WHICH SHOULD BE A VIEWED AS A POSITIVE SIGN FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT SOMETHING MORE OMINOUS IS ON THE HORIZON FOR U.S. STOCKS. WHAT, ME WORRY?
157	THERE ARE MANY TRAINING METHODS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYEE EDUCATION WITHIN A GOVERNMENT AGENCY: ONLINE COURSEWARE; VIRTUAL CLASSROOM; IN-PERSON, TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT; OR A COMBINATION OF IALL OF THE ABOVE. WHATEVER THE CHOICE, AN ORGANIZATIONS FUTURE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES SHOULD BE THE TRAINING MISSION, WITH THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL FRONT AND CENTER. IDEALLY, AN EMPLOYEES INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN WOULD MESH THE AGENCYS VISION AND ITS OPERATIONAL NECESSITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INDIVIDUALS CAREER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. A ROBUST AND WELL-DESIGNED TDRAINING PROGRAM THAT CONSIDERS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND TALENT GAPS IS AN EFFECTIVE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL. CASE IN POINT AS A COLLEGE GRADUATE, I ENTERED A SOPHISTICATED ARMY CIVILIAN TRAINING PROGRKAM IN WHAT HAS NOW EVOLVED INTO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. THAT PROGRAM INCLUDED MANDATORXY CLASSES, FUNCTIONAL HUMAN RESOURCES TRAINING, AND A TWO-YEAR ROTATIONAL ASSIGNMENT WITH A MANDATORY GEOGRAPHIC MOVE. FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE, I DID NOT KNOW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF WORRKING IN A FEDERAL ORGANIZATION, BUT THE TRAINING PROGRAM GAVE ME THE FOUNDATIONAL EDUCATION I NEEDED TO BOTH PERFORM MY JOB WELL AND ADVANCE MY FUTURE CAREER.  MATCHING METHOD TO GOALS AS FAR AS SPECIFIC LEARNING METHODS GO, NONE STAND OUT AS SUPERIOR. INDIVIDUAL NEEDS, LEARNING STYLES, AND ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN DECIDING WHICH EDUCATIONAL TOOLS WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES. FOR INSTANCE, TOTAL IMMERSION MAY NOT ALWAYS GIVE THE BEST RESULT, AS SOME EMPLOYBEES MAY BE MORE APT TO LEARN IN A HANDS-ON ENVIRONMENT OR THROUGH SMALLER BURSTS OF INFORMATION. MEANWHILE, THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN INVALUABLE AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE NETWORKING TOOL. CONSEQUENTLY, SPENDING TIMOE LEARNING WITH PEERS IN AN EMPLOYEES SAME DISCIPLINE OR AREA OF INTEREST CAN RESULT IN LASTING SUPPORT AND SYNERGY THAT ENDURES THROUGHOUT AND BEYOND FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT.  HOW ARE YOU DESIGNING YOUR TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MEET FUTURE AGENCY GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS? CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH AL RESSLER DURING THE SKILL SETUP: CHOOSING THE RIGHT TRAINING FOR THE RIGHT TASK SESSION DURING THE GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE: LEARNING INNOVATIONS CONFERENCE.
158	A SUFFOLK JUDGE WEDNESDAY SENTENCED A NORTHPORT HEROIN USER WHO WAS IN THE BACKSEAT WHEN HIS UNCLE RAN OVER A SUFFOLK POLICE OFFICER WITH A STOLEN CAR, TELLING HIM "YOUR STORY IS NOT UNIQUE." NICHOLAS FRANZONE, 23, PLEADED GUILTY LAST MONTH TO SECOND-DEGREE ROBBERY, CRIMINAL POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY AND OTHER CHARGES. HE HAD BEEN CHARGED ALONG WITH HIS UNCLE, CHAD MORIZSAN, 35, OF NORTHPORT, WITH THE SEPT. 22, 2014, ASSAULT OF NICHOLAS GUERRERO, WHO HAS SINCE BEEN PROMOTED TO DETECTIVE BUT HAS NOT YET RETURNED TO DUTY. THEY WERE IN A FORD EXPLORER THAT MORIZSAN HAD STOLEN WHEN GUERRERO PULLED IT OVER IN HUNTINGTON. DURING THE STOP, WHILE FRANZONE WAS IN THE BACKSEAT, MORIZSAN TOOK OFF, HIT GUERRERO AND LEFT HIM IN THE STREET WITH A BROKEN SKULL, SEVERAL BROKEN RIBS, A COLLAPSED LUNG AND OTHER INJURIES. THE PAIR THEN CARJACKED ANOTHER VEHICLE FROM A WOMAN AND USED HER CREDIT CARD TO BUY A TELEVISION. THEY WERE ARRESTED WHEN THEY TRIED TO RETURN IT FOR A LARGER ONE. MORISZAN IS SERVING 25 YEARS IN PRISON FOR THE ASSAULT OF GUERRERO. BEFORE SENTENCING FRANZONE TO 3 YEARS IN PRISON, STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE FERNANDO CAMACHO TOLD HIM THAT HE SEES YOUNG MEN LIKE HIM ALL TOO OFTEN. "WE HAVE A WHOLE POPULATION OF ZOMBIES RUNNING AROUND SUFFOLK COUNTY WREAKING HAVOC," CAMACHO SAID, REFERRING TO PEOPLE WHO COMMIT CRIMES TO PAY FOR THEIR ADDICTIONS. "IT'S VERY DISHEARTENING. THEY DO NOTHING BUT HURT THEMSELVES AND HURT OTHERS." ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY CARL BORELLI SAID THE SENTENCE WAS THE RIGHT ONE FOR FRANZONE, WHO HE SAID WAS "APPROPRIATELY REMORSEFUL." FRANZONE'S ATTORNEY, IAN FITZGERALD OF CENTRAL ISLIP, SAID HIS CLIENT IS HEALTHIER PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY SINCE SPENDING THE PAST YEAR IN JAIL AND NOT ON HEROIN. FRANZONE APOLOGIZED TO GUERRERO, WHO WAS NOT PRESENT, AND TO EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE CASE. "I WOULD LIKE TO DO MY TIME AND MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE," HE SAID. "I TRULY AM SORRY FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED THAT DAY." CAMACHO TOLD FRANZONE THAT WHEN HE LEAVES PRISON, HE'LL STAY CLEAN. "THIS MAY ACTUALLY WORK FOR YOU, BEING CLEAN FOR A FEW YEARS," CAMACHO SAID.
159	MR MELNICHENKO SPENT 400 MILLION (292 MILLION/$450MILLION) ON THE LUXURY SHIP WHICH WILL BE NAMED THE 'SAILING YACHT A' IT BOASTS EIGHT DECKS, A GLASS OBSERVATION AREA, MEASURES A ROOMY 468 FEET AND WEIGHS 14,224 TONS THE SHIP WILL HAVE A CREW OF AROUND 54 PEOPLE AND WILL BE THE LARGEST PRIVATELY OWNED SAILING YACHT IN THE WORLD THE MASTS ARE TALLER THAN BIG BEN'S TOWER AND ITS SAILS ARE BIGGER THAN A FOOTBALL FIELD WHEN ALL ARE FLYING BY KATE PICKLES AND RICHARD GRAY FOR MAILONLINE PUBLISHED: 04:49 EST, 28 AUGUST 2015 | UPDATED: 09:13 EST, 31 AUGUST 2015 917 VIEW COMMENTS IT'S NOT A DILEMMA THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL EVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BUT WHAT DOES A MAN WORTH 6BILLION ($9BILLION) DO TO SPEND HIS MONEY? RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN ANDREY MELNICHENKO HAS ANSWERED THE BILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION AFTER BUILDING THE WORLD'S LARGEST SAILING YACHT - AT A COST OF 292 MILLION ($450 MILLION). THE MULTI-BILLIONAIRE ALREADY HAS ONE LUXURY HOME ON THE SEAS - THE MOTOR YACHT A - BUT HAS THIS TIME TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO SAILING POWER. GRAND DESIGNS: RUSSIAN BILLIONAIREANDREY MELNICHENKO, 43, PICTURED HERE WITH WIFE ALEKSANDRA, 38, HAS COMMISSIONED A 292 MILLION ($450 MILLION) SAILING YACHT. THE COUPLE HAVE ONE CHILD. IT WILL SIMILARLY BE CALLED 'SAILING YACHT A' AND MEASURE A ROOMY 468 FEET (143 METRES) FROM ONE END OF THE SUMPTUOUS CRAFT TO THE OTHER. THE EPIC VESSEL BOASTS A STAGGERING EIGHT DECKS AND ITS KEEL INCORPORATES ONE OF THE LARGEST SINGLE PIECES OF CURVED GLASS EVER MADE AT 193 SQUARE FEET AND WEIGHS A WHOPPING 1.8 TONS. THIS HAS BEEN USED TO CREATE A STUNNING OBSERVATION POD ON THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL SO MR MELNICHENKOAND SERBIAN MODEL WIFE ALEKSANDRA, CAN ENJOY STUNNING VIEWS OF THE SEA. MR MELNICHENKO, WHO RANKED 97TH IN THE FORBES WORLD'S BILLIONAIRES LIST, HIRED MASTER SHIP DESIGNER PHILIPPE STARCK, WHOSE CREDENTIALS INCLUDE STEVE JOBS' FAMOUS YACHT AND MR MELNICHENKO'S FIRST OPULENT VESSEL. WITH ITS THREE MASTS STANDING TALLER THAN THE TOWER WHICH HOUSES BIG BEN, IT WILL DWARF OTHER FAMOUS SUPER-YACHTS LIKE THE MALTESE FALCON, OWNED BY AMERICAN VENTURE CAPITALIST TOM PERKINS. THE SUPER YACHT WILL WEIGH 14,224 TONS AND HAVE SAILS THAT ARE LARGER THAN A FOOTBALL FIELD, WHEN PLACED SIDE-BY-SIDE. THE YACHT, WHICH MR MELNICHENKO IS THOUGHT TO HAVE NAMED 'A' TO ENSURE IT IS LISTED FIRST IN SHIPPING REGISTERS, IS DUE TO BEGIN ITS FIRST SEA TRIALS LATER THIS YEAR. INITIALLY IT WILL BE TESTED WITH ONE MAST BEFORE THE OTHERS ARE FIXED IN PLACE. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO KEEP A SUPERYACHT ON THE WATER? FROM RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS TO MIDDLE EASTERN ROYALTY TO HOLLYWOOD PRODUCERS, IT TAKES A CERTAIN TYPE OF PERSON TO OWN A SUPERYACHT - CRUCIALLY, THEY MUST BE SUPER RICH. ANDREY MILNICHENKO HAS INVESTED $451 MILLION INTO HIS NEW VESSEL SAILING YACHT A. HOWEVER, THE INITIAL COST IS ONLY PART OF OWNING SUCH A LUXURIOUS VESSEL. FOR WEALTHY OWNERS LIKE ROMAN ABRAMOVICH AND UAE PRESIDENT KHALIFA AL NAHYAN, OWNERS OF TWO OF THE COSTLIEST PRIVATE VESSELS IN THE WORLD, THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH KEEPING SUCH BIG BOATS ON THE WATER ARE STAGGERING. INSURANCE COMPANY TOWERGATEESTIMATES THAT 10 PER CENT OF THE INITIAL VALUE OF A SUPERYACHT GOES ON OPERATING COSTS. FOR CHELSEA FOOTBALL CLUB OWNER ABRAMOVICH'S ECLIPSE, A 162.5M VESSEL WITH A MISSILE DEFENCE SYSTEM THAT COST THE BILLIONAIRE AN ASTRONOMICAL $500MILION (332), THAT MEANS $50M (33M) A YEAR. THE STANDARD FUEL USAGE FOR A 71M YACHT IS 500 LITRES AN HOUR, MEANING AN AVERAGE OF $400,000 (265,000) IS SPENT ON PETROL EVERY YEAR PER VESSEL. THE VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT) WORKS OUT AT 15-25 PER CENT OF THE VESSEL'S VALUE WHILE DOCKING COSTS ARE AN AVERAGE $350,000 (232,000) AND $240,000 (159,000) THE STANDARD FOR INSURANCE SEES THE COSTS SOAR. ADD TO THAT THE EXPECTED $1MILLION (664,000) PER YEAR FOR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS AND THE WAGES FOR AN AVERAGE $1.4M (930,000) FOR AN ON-BOARD CREW - WHICH CAN RANGE FROM LESS THAN 20 TO 154 STAFF ON THE SULTAN OF OMAN'S MYSTERIOUS AL SAID SUPERYACHT - AND IT'S A SIGNIFICANT OUTLAY. MR MELNICHENKO, WHOSE NET WORTH IS ESTIMATED AT 6BILLION ($9BILLION), FOUNDED THE FERTILIZER PRODUCER EUROCHEM, THE COAL PRODUCER SUEK, THE POWER GENERATOR SGK, AND THE PIPE EXPORTER TMK ALONG WITH SERGEI POPOV. 'SAILING YACHT A' IN NUMBERS WEIGHT: 14,224 TONS HEIGHT: 468 FEET (143 METRES) SPEED: 21 KNOTS (24MPH) RANGE: 5,320 NAUTICAL MILES PASSENGERS: 20 CREW: 54 MR MELNICHENKO WAS ALSO KEEN TO PACK THE YACHT WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND SAILING ENGINEERING. ALTHOUGH IT WILL HAVE ROOM FOR A CREW OF AROUND 54, THE YACHT WILL HAVE A HIGH-TECH DIGITAL CONTROL SYSTEM OPERATED USING A TOUCH SENSITIVE SHEET OF BLACK GLASS IN THE BRIDGE. THIS WILL ALLOW THE CREW TO RAISE AND LOWER THE SAILS AND EVEN DROP THE ANCHOR WITH A BRUSH OF THEIR FINGERS. A SPOKESMAN FOR MR MELNICHENKO TOLD MAIL ONLINE IT 'PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES.; 'THIS PROJECT WAS A CONSIDERABLE FINANCIAL RISK FOR HIM AS HE HAD TO FUND MASSIVE R&D TO SEE IF HE COULD ACHIEVE HIS VISION. 'BUT HE IS A MAN TO ALWAYS PUSH THE BOUNDARIES AND TO CHALLENGE THE INDUSTRIES HE WORKS WITH TO THINK OUT OF THE BOX SO HE CAN ACHIEVE SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING AS WELL AS BEAUTIFUL. 'SAILING YACHT A IS A MONUMENT TO INVENTION.' WITH AN 26FT (8 METRES) KEEL AND WIDTH OF AROUND 81 FEET (24.88 METRES), SAILING YACHT A HAD TO BE BUILT IN ONE OF THE LARGEST SHIPYARDS IN THE WORLD IN NOBISKRUG IN GERMANY. THE MASTS WERE BUILT BY MAGMA STRUCTURES FROM CARBON FIBRE AND WILL BE THE LARGEST AND MOST HIGHLY LOADED COMPOSITE FREESTANDING STRUCTURES IN THE WORLD. THE MAIN MAST IS SO LARGE THAT IT CONTAINS A SMALL ROOM INSIDE. SPECIAL BOOMS ALSO HAD TO BE BUILT TO HOLD THE ENORMOUS SAILS, THE LARGEST OF WHICH IS 19,019 SQUARE FEET (1,767 SQUARE METRES). HAMBURG-BASED GL YACHTVERGLASGUN GMBH HAD TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNIQUES TO CREATE THE GLASS HULL AND THEN TESTED IT IN GENEVA IN WATER UP TO 393 FEET (120M) TO ENSURE IT COULD WITHSTAND THE WATER PRESSURE. BOAT INTERNATIONAL, WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO SAILING YACHT A, SAID: 'ANDREY MELNICHENKO IS A MAN WITH EXCEPTIONAL VISION. THE SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE AND THE POP STAR WHO LOVES J-LO: WHO ARE ANDREY AND ALEKSANDRA MELNICHENKO? ANDREY MELNICHENKO, REFERRED TO AS THE 'KING OF BLING' IN TATLER IN 2014, WAS ALREADY WELL ON HIS WAY TO AMASSING HIS $9 BILLION (6 BILLION) FORTUNE, WHEN HE MET HIS YOUNG WIFE ALEKSANDRA - THE FOUNDER MEMBER OF SERBIA'S VERSION OF THE SPICE GIRLS, MODELS. BORN IN GOMEL, BELARUS, MELNICHENKO BECAME ONE OF THE WORLD'S YOUNGEST BILLIONAIRES AFTER FOUNDING A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES - CULMINATING IN MOSCOW'S MDM BANK IN 1993, WHICH WENT ON TO HOLD ACCOUNTS FOR THE COUNTRY'S MOST POWERFUL OLIGARCHS INCLUDING ROMAN ABRAMOVICH. MELNICHENKO NOW RANKS AS 97TH IN THE FORBES WORLD'S BILLIONAIRES LIST AND IS THE NINTH RICHEST MAN IN RUSSIA YACHT COUTURE: ANDREY AND ALEKSANDRA MELNICHENKO HAVE ACQUIRED A SECOND SPRAWLING SUPER-YACHT FOR THEIR FLEET. THE COUPLE REGULARLY PARTY ON THEIR $300M FIRST YACHT WITH CELEBRITIES AND THEIR BELOVED DOG, VALA THE COUPLE MET IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE - WHEN ALEKSANDRA - KNOWN AS SANDRA - WAS 28 AND ANDREY WAS 33 - AND WITHIN TWO YEARS THEY WERE MARRIED IN THE SAME SPOT IN AN EXTRAVAGANT $29 MILLION WEDDING ATTENDED BY CHRISTINA AGUILERA (RUMORED TO HAVE BEEN PAID $3.6 MILLION TO PERFORM JUST THREE SONGS) WHITNEY HOUSTON, JULIO AND ENRIQUE INGLESIAS AND CELEBRITY FRIENDS - OR PAID-UP ENTERTAINERS - AREN'T A ONE-OFF FOR THE COUPLE. ANDREY FAMOUSLY PAID JENNIFER LOPEZ $2 MILLION TO PERFORM AT HIS WIFE'S LAVISH 30TH BIRTHDAY PARTY AT THEIR ENGLISH MANSION IN ASCOT.DEMI MOORE AND ASHTON KUTCHER ARE ALSO AMONG THE MANY CELEBRITIES TO HAVE RUNG IN THE NEW YEAR AT ONE OF THEIR SAILING PARTIES IN THE CARIBBEAN. IN 2008, LENNY KRAVITZ PERFORMED AT THEIR THIRD WEDDING ANNIVERSARY ON THEIR FIRST SUPER-YACHT - THE 394FT, $300MILLION MOTOR DRIVEN 'A' - AND THREE YEARS LATER, SNOOP DOGG ENTERTAINED PARTY-GOERS IN A SPECIALLY-BUILT MIRRORED DISCO ROOM ON THE YACHT WHILE ALEKSANDRA PARTIED IN A LIME-GREEN GIVENCHY MERMAID GOWN. SPEAKING TO HARPER'S BAZAAR, MRS MELNICHENKO WHO STARTED MODELLING FROM THE AGE OF 15, SAID HER FIRST SUPER-YACHT WAS THE PERFECT PLACE TO THROW A PARTY. TWO BECOME ONE: MELNICHENKO MET HIS WIFE ALEKSANDRA IN 2003. THE MODEL HAD BECOME A HOUSEHOLD NAME IN SERBIA AS THE FOUNDER MEMBER OF GIRL BAND MODELS - THE COUNTRY'S ANSWER TO THE SPICE GIRLS 'THE BOAT IS PERFECT FOR PARTIES, AND WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE,' SHE TOLD THE MAGAZINE. HOWEVER, THEIR PARTYING WAYS AREN'T THE ONLY REASONS THE MELNICHENKOS HAVE MADE THE HEADLINES. IN 2011, CURBED REPORTED THE COUPLE WERE THE MYSTERY NEW OWNERS OF THE DUPLEX PENTHOUSE AT 110 CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - PAYING $12.2MILLION IN CASH FOR THE 2,800SQ FT LUXURY PROPERTY. THE COUPLE ALSO OWN HOMES IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE; A $4.5 MILLION LONDON APARTMENT AND THEIR SPRAWLING $36 MILLION ASCOT ESTATE IN 2013 THEY SUED OVER A SCULPTURE BY POLISH ARTIST IGOR MITORAJ CLAIMING IT WAS ALMOST HALF THE HEIGHT OF THE PROMISED 7FT AND IN THE SAME YEAR ALSO SUED DULUX OWNER AKZO NOBEL FOR $100MILLION CLAIMING THE PAINT JOB ON MOTOR YACHT 'A' HAD 'LINES AND SAGS' WITH A 'CLOUDY APPEARANCE'. THE COUPLE REPORTEDLY HAVE A CHILD AND A BELOVED MALTESE PUP NAMED VALA, WHO ACCOMPANIES THEM ON ALL THEIR TRAVELS. 'WHERE OTHER YACHT OWNERS LIKE TO BLEND INTO THE BACKGROUND, HE WANTS HIS SUPERYACHTS TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF DESIGN, CREATIVITY AND TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS MAKE A STATEMENT. 'HIS FIRST SUPERYACHT, MOTOR YACHT A, ROCKED THE SUPERYACHT WORLD WITH ITS RADICAL DESIGN AND NOW HE'S DONE IT AGAIN.' IT WILL BE POWERED BY TWO DIESEL ENGINES AND TWO ELECTRIC MOTORS WHICH DRIVE FIVE-BLADED ADJUSTABLE PITCH PROPELLERS. THE VESSEL IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A TOP SPEED OF 21 KNOTS (24MPH) AND TO CRUISE UNDER POWER AT 16 KNOTS (18MPH) WITH AN EXPECTED RANGE OF 5,320 NAUTICAL MILES. ALL THE WINDOWS ON THE YACHT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO BE FLUSH WHILE A HELICOPTER PAD HAS ALSO BEEN BUILT ONTO THE SIXTH DECK OF THE YACHT TO DROP OFF AND PICK UP PASSENGERS. THE INTERIOR ITSELF IS BEING KEPT STRICTLY UNDER WRAPS, ALTHOUGH IF IT IS SIMILAR TO THE 394-FOOT MOTOR YACHT A IT WILL COMBINE LUXURY WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY. MOTOR YACHT A CAN ACCOMMODATE UP TO 14 GUESTS AND WAS DECORATED WITH BACCARAT CRYSTAL AND MIRRORED SURFACES. IT ALSO USED BOMB PROOF GLASS AND 40 CCTV CAMERAS TO ENSURE SECURITY. SPEAKING TO BOAT INTERNATIONAL ABOUT HIS LATEST PROJECT FOR MR MELNICHENKO, PHILIPPE STARCK SAID: 'I AM HONOURED AND HAPPY TO BRING TO LIFE THE OWNER'S DREAM OF WHAT WILL BE THE SUMMIT OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND POETRY.'

THE FUNDS RAISED FROM THE SALE OF THE PEDAL CAR FLEET WILL AID IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CHILDREN WITH NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS.
161	IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT I GO INTO A FILM WITH NO EXPECTATIONS. I ALWAYS END UP SEEING A TRAILER AND READING REVIEWS THAT CAN CLOUD MY JUDGEMENT ON A FILM. SOMETIMES MY EXPECTATIONS ARE TOO HIGH AND I END UP REALLY DISAPPOINTED, OTHER TIMES I'M SURPRISED WHEN A FILM I HAD LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR TURNS OUT TO BE AMAZING. ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL IS ONE WHERE I HAD NO PRECONCEPTIONS. I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THE TRAILERS AND I READ AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REVIEWS, GIVING ME A NEUTRAL IMAGE OF THE FILM AND NO EXPECTATIONS FOR THE QUALITY, AND I THINK IT'S BEST THAT I WENT IN LIKE THAT. HAVING NO EXPECTATIONS OPENED ME UP TO BE INCREDIBLY SURPRISED BY THE FILM AND MOVED BY IT'S STORY. THE PLOT REVOLVES AROUND GREG, A SOCIALLY AWKWARD TEENAGER IN HIS FINAL YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO HAS NO REAL PLANS FOR THE FUTURE AND BELIEVES THE BEST WAY TO REMAIN INVISIBLE IS TO HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT, RETAIN JUST ENOUGH OF A CONNECTION TO ALL THE HIGH SCHOOL SOCIAL CIRCLES SO THAT HE'S BOTH IN AND OUT OF ALL OF THEM. THE ONLY PERSON HE HAS A CONNECTION TO IS EARL, WHO GREG CONSIDERS TO BE A CO-WORKER DUE TO THEM MAKING, BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION, TERRIBLE FILM PARODIES. THIS CHANGES WHEN GREG'S MUM FORCES HIM TO SPEND TIME WITH RACHEL, A GIRL LIVING NEAR HIM WHO HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKIMIA AND OVER TIME, A FRIENDSHIP DEVELOPS BETWEEN THE TWO. NORMALLY, THIS TYPE OF FILM WOULD INFURIATE ME, IT HAS ALL THE MAKINGS OF AN OVERLY SENTIMENTAL LOVE STORY IN THE VEIN OF THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, BUT HERE IT WORKS AND FOR ONE KEY REASON: IT'S NOT A LOVE STORY. THROUGHOUT THE FILM, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF ANY ROMANTIC ATTRACTION BETWEEN GREG AND RACHEL, IT'S ALL FRIENDSHIP. IT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF JUST HAVING SOMEONE TO TALK TO DURING THESE EVENTS AND THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN GREG AND RACHEL IS REALLY NATURAL, AS MUCH AS THE TWO WERE FORCED INTO IT, THE ACTUAL RELATIONSHIP DOESN'T FEEL FORCED IN THE SLIGHTEST. IT ALSO DOES A GOOD JOB AT EXPOSING THE SELFISH ATTITUDES OF SOMEONE LIKE GREG. IT'S CLEAR THAT HE HAS NO AMBITIONS AND IN TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYONE TO REMAIN INVISIBLE, HE HAS NO REAL CONNECTION TO ANYONE, HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE TRUE DETAILS OF PEOPLE, A POINT WHICH COMES ACROSS REALLY WELL IN A CONVERSATION HE HAS WITH HIS HISTORY TEACHER AND THE FINAL SCENE OF THE FILM. IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT, WITHOUT THE INFLUENCE OF RACHEL, AND BY EXTENSION HIS PARENTS, HE WOULD HAVE NO FUTURE. GREG MAKES IT CLEAR THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO UNIVERSITY BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE HE WOULDN'T FIT IN, AND VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER CHARACTER IN THE FILM CALLS GREG OUT ON THIS ATTITUDE, ESPECIALLY RACHEL WHO FORCES HIM TO APPLY. WE SEE THAT GREG DOES HAVE TALENT AND SOME FORM OF DRIVE BUT HIS OWN SELFISH ATTITUDES ARE HOLDING HIM BACK, HE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND EMPATHY IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW SELFISH HE'S BEING. THIS IS ALSO A GOOD TIME TO BRING IN EARL. THE FILM MAKES IT CLEAR THAT EARL HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET GREG TO OPEN UP, MAINLY SO GREG CAN ACCEPT HIM AS A FRIEND. ALL OF THE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR GREG TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON HINGE ON EARL GETTING GREG TO ADMIT HIS TALENTS TO PEOPLE, MAINLY WHEN EARL FIRST TELLS RACHEL ABOUT GREG'S FILMMAKING AND WHEN GREG REJECTS THESE EFFORTS TO MAKE HIM BETTER EARL CUTS OFF TIES WITH HIM, BUT AS THE FILM GOES ON, WE SEE THAT EARL IS A TRUE FRIEND TO GREG, UNAFRAID TO DEFEND HIM FROM ATTACKS BUT WILLING TO CALL GREG OUT FOR HIS SELFISH ATTITUDES. THE WHOLE FILM IS ABOUT GETTING GREG TO APPRECIATE HIS TALENTS, LOSE HIS SELFISHNESS AND UNDERSTAND LIFE BETTER AND, FOR SOMEONE AS ISOLATED AND SELFISH AS GREG, IT COULD ONLY BE THROUGH AN EXPERIENCE WITH DEATH. THAT BEING SAID, NOT ALL OF THE PLOT ELEMENTS WORK. THERE ARE A FEW CHARACTERS THAT DON'T REALLY WORK IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS AND PLOT POINTS THAT DON'T FULLY GET RESOLVED. THESE ARE MOMENTS THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE WORKED BETTER ON THE PAGE THAN ON THE SCREEN. INDIVIDUALLY, THESE MOMENTS DO CREATE SOME GOOD LAUGHS AND SOME GOOD CHARACTER MOMENTS, BUT AS A WHOLE, THEY DON'T REALLY ADD MUCH TO THE FILM EXPERIENCE. THE CAST MEANWHILE REALLY SELL THE NATURE OF THE PLOT. I'VE SAID ALL I NEED TO ABOUT GREG PREVIOUSLY SO I WON'T REPEAT MYSELF HERE, SUFFICE IT TO SAY, THOMAS MANN DOES A GREAT JOB SELLING BOTH THE SELFISH NATURE OF THE CHARACTER AND THE EVENTUAL REFORM OF THE CHARACTER AND UNDERSTANDING HOW TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON. THIS IS MATCHED BY AN INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE BY OLIVIA COOKE AS RACHEL. SHE BRILLIANTLY SHOWS THE PAIN THAT A DISEASE LIKE LEUKEMIA CAN CAUSE AND THE NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE JUST TALK TO YOU AND MAKE YOU LAUGH, WITH THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN HER AND MANN NAILING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS. WHEN THINGS START TO GO DOWNHILL FOR RACHEL IN TERMS OF HER TREATMENT, COOKE BRILLIANTLY SHOWS THE PAIN THAT THE DISEASE IS GIVING HER AND WE SEE HER WILL TO LIVE START TO DECLINE AND IN THESE SCENES, COOKE'S PERFORMANCE IS INCREDIBLE, SHOWING HOW DIFFICULT HER DECISIONS HAVE BEEN TO MAKE AND I CAME INCREDIBLY CLOSE TO CRYING DURING THESE SCENES (WHICH IS RARE FOR ME, THE ONLY FILMS I'VE SEEN THAT HAVE ACTIVELY LED TO ME CRYING ARE THE ELEPHANT MAN, WALL-E AND UP). RJ CYLER MEANWHILE DOES A GREAT JOB AS EARL, HIS MORE OPTIMISTIC ATTITUDE BEING A GREAT COUNTERPOINT FOR GREG AND IT'S CLEAR THAT, WITHOUT EARL, GREG WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND HIGH SCHOOL. THERE'S A BIT OF A HERZOG-KINSKI PARALLEL BETWEEN GREG AND EARL THAT THE FILM MAKES CLEAR, WITH EARL WANTING TO GET GREG TO EXPRESS HIMSELF AND GREG BEING A SELFISH, EGOMANIAC WHO DOESN'T WANT TO AND HAS TO BE FORCED TO. THERE'S ALSO A GOOD PERFORMANCE FROM KATHERINE HUGHES AS MADISON, A CLASSMATE OF GREG'S AND ANOTHER PERSON WHO TRIES TO GET GREG TO OPEN UP TO RACHEL THROUGH HIS FILMS, MAINLY BE ENCOURAGING GREG TO MAKE A FILM FOR RACHEL, AND IT'S CLEAR THAT SHE HAS SYMPATHY FOR RACHEL'S SITUATION AND SORT OF UNDERSTANDS GREG AND DOES WHAT SHE FEEL IS BEST FOR BOTH OF THEM AND, AGAIN, IT'S GREAT THAT THE CHARACTER DOESN'T BECOME A LOVE INTEREST. THERE'S GREAT COMIC RELIEF FROM NICK OFFERMAN AS GREG'S DAD, ADDING HIS REALLY DRY COMEDIC STYLE TO THE FILM AS A PRETENTIOUS SOCIOLOGY WRITER, JON BERNTHAL, WHO'S A LOT OF FUN AS GREG'S HISTORY TEACHER, HAVING SOME OF THE BEST LAUGHS IN THE FILM, ALONG WITH A REALLY GREAT DRAMATIC MOMENT. MOLLY SHANNON AS RACHEL'S MUM IS ALSO WORTHY OF MENTION AS SHE BRILLIANTLY SHOWS HOW SOMEONE WOULD REACT TO THEIR KID GETTING DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKEMIA AND THE DIFFICULTY SHE HAS IN ACCEPTING WHAT IS HAPPENING TO RACHEL. THERE'S ALSO A FUN LITTLE CAMEO FROM HUGH JACKMAN THAT PROVIDES A GREAT LAUGH. ON A TECHNICAL SIDE, THE FILM IS QUITE CLEARLY TRYING TO EMULATE THE FILMS OF WES ANDERSON, AT THE START AT LEAST. THE USE OF CHAPTER HEADINGS AND THE WAY THE SHOTS ARE COMPOSED, ALONG WITH THE USE OF STOP MOTION, IS VERY REMINISCENT OF ANDERSON'S WORK BUT AS THE FILM GOES ON, THIS STYLE STARTS TO BECOME LESS PROMINENT AS THE TRUE WEIGHT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TO RACHEL BECOMES CLEAR. SPECIAL MENTION IN THE TECHNICALS HAS TO GO TO THE FILM PARODIES THEMSELVES. THE TITLES OF THEM ALONE WERE ENOUGH TO GET A LAUGH OUT OF ME AND THE PRODUCTION ELEMENTS IN EACH OF THESE FILMS DOES ENOUGH WORK TO RECREATE THE STYLE OF THE ORIGINAL FILMS WHILST PUTTING THEIR OWN SPIN ON IT, SPECIAL MENTION GOING TO A SOCKWORK ORANGE. AS SAID BEFORE, THERE IS A BIT OF HERZOG AND KINSKI IN THE CHARACTERS OF GREG AND EARL AND THIS COMES ACROSS IN THE STYLE OF THE FILM AS WELL, WITH THERE BEING A CLEAR INFLUENCE OF HERZOG IN THE DIRECTION AND CINEMATOGRAPHY THAT'S SUBTLE ENOUGH WHERE YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE IT UNLESS YOU KNOW THE FILMS OF HERZOG. THE MUSIC BY BRIAN ENO MEANWHILE IS GREAT AT SETTING THE TONE FOR THE FILM, WORKING ESPECIALLY WELL AT THE END OF THE FILM AND BEING ONE OF THE MAIN ELEMENTS THAT CREATED SUCH A STRONG EMOTIONAL REACTION FROM ME. OVERALL, THIS IS A FILM I HAD NO EXPECTATIONS FOR GOING IN AND ENDED UP LOVING. FILMS LIKE THIS NORMALLY INFURIATE ME BUT WHEN THEY'RE DONE RIGHT, THEY CAN CREATE GREAT CHARACTERS, MEMORABLE MOMENTS AND BRILLIANT STORIES. THIS IS ANOTHER CASE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER FOR ME, AND IN MANY WAYS THIS FILM WORKS AS A BIT OF A COMPANION PIECE TO THAT ONE, SHOWING THE IMPORTANCE OF FRIENDSHIP IN THE HARDEST TIME OF A PERSONS LIFE AND I HAVE NO RESERVATIONS IN RECOMMENDING THIS FILM. MY RATING: 5/5
162	WHEN WE GOT INTO RVING, I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE AMERICA BUT AFTER FOUR YEARS I NOW FIND THE BEST PART OF RVING IS MEETING AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY BLOGGERS AND RVERS AND WHILE IN DENVER WE GOT TO DO A 3FER. IT BEGAN WITH OUR THIRD VISIT WITH BOB AND LEA ANN (COOKING ON THE RANCH) AND INCLUDED BLOGGER HEATHER (ROCKY MOUNTAIN COOKING) AND LAS GODDAUGHTER STEPHANIE AT THEIR NEW DIGS IN HIGHLANDS RANCH FOR A CASUAL DINNER PARTY. ALL OF THESE SHOTS WERE TAKEN BY VARIOUS PHONES AND SENT TO ME - MY CAMERA WAS IN THE CAR. OUR ASSIGNMENT WAS TO MAKE GRILLED OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER AND TEACH THEM HOW (INCLUDING SHUCKING) USING OUR NORMAL RECIPE. HEATHER STARTED THE FOOD WITH SOME PROSCIUTTO WRAPPED GRILLED SHRIMP. THEN IT WAS OYSTER TIME AND STEPHANIE WAS COMMITTED TO LEARNING HOW TO GET INTO AN OYSTER IT ONLY TOOK HER FOUR TRIES AND THEN SHE ATE HER FIRST RAW ONE AND DECIDED IT WASNT HALF BAD. READY FOR THE GRILL AFTER STEPHANIE ADDED THE TOPPING. ON THE FLAMING HOT GRILL. EVEN REMY APPRECIATES GOOD SEAFOOD AND THE OTHER DOGS PRETTY WELL CLEANED OUT THE SHELLS. WE FINISHED THE MEAL OFF WITH LEA'S PULLED PORK SLIDERS AND NEVER GOT AROUND TO EATING HER DELICIOUS LOOKING SALAD - WE BROUGHT SOME HOME AND IT WAS AS GOOD AS IT LOOKED. BE SURE TO STOP BY LEA ANNS AND HEATHERS BLOGS FOR SOME GOOD EATS. AS ALWAYS IT WAS SUCH A PLEASURE TO SPEND TIME WITH THIS GROUP AND TO BE TREATED SO SPECIAL EVEN THOUGH WEVE ONLY BEEN TOGETHER THREE TIMES OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. BLOGGERS ARE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE. THE NEXT DAY, WE MET AL AND INGRID (LIVE LAUGH RV) FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A FOUR HOUR LUNCH AT C.B. POTTS AND IT WAS A PLEASURE TO MEET AND CONNECT WITH THEM. WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER ON A DEEPER LEVEL, SHARED TRAVEL STORIES AND BACKGROUNDS AND LAUGHED HARD AT THEIR STORIES FROM WHEN THEY WERE PILOT AND FLIGHT ATTENDANT. THEY ARE FULL TIMER RVERS TRAVELING THE NOMADIC LIFESTYLE AFTER CAREERS IN THE AIRLINE AND HOME BUILDING INDUSTRIES. ITS FUNNY HOW WHEN YOU MEET A BLOGGER BUDDY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING FOR A WHILE ITS LIKE YOU ARE ALREADY OLE FRIENDS. DID I MENTION THAT BLOGGERS ARE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE. I REALLY ENJOY INGRIDS BLOG AND HER GREAT PHOTOGRAPHY AND TO TRAVEL ALONG WITH HER AND AL, STOP BY THEIR BLOG (LINK ABOVE). THANKS TO ALL OF YOU FOR SHARING A PIECE OF YOUR LIVES WITH US AND CREATING SPECIAL MEMORIES THAT ARE NEVER FORGOTTEN. PHOTOS CAN BE ENLARGED BY CLICKING ON THEM.

169	IT TURNS OUT MOST MALES DONT CARE ABOUT A WOMANS SENSE OF HUMOR, ACCORDING TO A SEPT. 4 VICE ARTICLE . SO LADIES, STOP TRYING TO MAKE THE AVERAGE GUY LAUGH. YOURE FUNNY, BUT ITS USUALLY A WASTE OF BREATH. CITING A RECENT STUDY FROM THE JOURNAL EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY TITLED SEXUAL SELECTION AND HUMOR IN COURTSHIP: A CASE FOR WARMTH AND EXTROVERSION, VICE POINTS OUT THAT WOMEN FIND HUMOROUS DUDES MORE ATTRACTIVE. MEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, DONT NOTICE A WOMANS ABILITY TO MAKE THEM GIGGLE. WHEN A WOMAN CAN UNDERSTAND A JOKE, IT MAKES THEM MORE AFFABLE AND COOL, THE STUDY NOTES. FOR THE TYPICAL ALPHA MALE, THE GIRL WHO CAN BE AN AUDIENCE TO HIS FLEDGLING STAND-UP ROUTINE IS USUALLY THE MOST ATTRACTIVE CANDIDATE. FOR THE STUDY, A GROUP OF 102 HETEROSEXUAL FEMALES AND MALES WERE PUT INTO PAIRS FOR BLIND DATES. USING PROMPTS, THE COUPLES WERE ASKED TO STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION AND RANK THEIR INTEREST IN EACH OTHER AFTER 10 MINUTES. WHEN THE DATES WERE OVER, RESEARCHERS REVIEWED VIDEOS OF THE INTERACTIONS AND LOOKED FOR HUMOR. ALTHOUGH MEN MADE ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE ATTEMPTS AT BEING FUNNY, THE WOMEN LAUGHED WAY MORE OFTEN IN RESPONSE TO JOKES, VICE WRITES. THE MORE WOMEN LAUGHED, THE MORE THEIR INTEREST IN THE OTHER PERSON WENT UP. THAT WASN'T TRUE FOR MEN WHO LAUGHED AT WOMEN'S JOKES THEY DIDN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE HUMOR. RESEARCHERS BELIEVE THIS PHENOMENA HAS GROWN OUT OF TRADITIONAL SOCIAL VALUES. MEN HAVE LONG USED HUMOR AS A MEANS OF FLIRTING AND WOMEN ACCEPT IT. NOT ALL WOMEN, THOUGH. COMEDIC GENIUSES LIKE TINA FEY, AMY POEHLER AND AMY SCHUMER HAVE CARVED THEIR WAY INTO A MALE-DOMINATED INDUSTRY, PROVING THAT JOKES COMING FROM FEMALES CAN BE HEARD, AND EVEN REVERED. A VANITY FAIR ARTICLE FROM WAY BACK IN 2008 EXPLAINS THAT THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HILARIOUS WOMEN. FROM LUCILLE BALL AND PHYLLIS DILLER TO JOAN RIVERS AND CAROL BURNETT, THESE ICONIC COMEDIENNES HAVE BEEN SETTING THE RIGHT EXAMPLE: IF YOURE FUNNY, FLAUNT IT. MEN WILL EVENTUALLY SHUT UP AND APPRECIATE THE HUMOR.

171	DESPITE ASSURANCES FROM THE FRANCOPHONE NORTHEAST SCHOOL DISTRICT, A CUSTODIAN EMPLOYED THERE IS WORRIED ABOUT ASBESTOS HARMING CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL WHERE HE WORKS. RAYMOND BASKIN HAS BEEN WORKING AT COLE LA RIVIRE FOR 30 YEARS AND NOW SUFFERS FROM PULMONARY FIBROSIS, A CONDITION WORKSAFENB HAS ACCEPTED AS BEING CONNECTED TO ASBESTOS IN THE BUILDING. THE SCHOOL HAD ASBESTOS CLEANED UP IN 2014. AIR QUALITY TESTING IS NOW ON-GOING, ACCORDING TO ELOI DOUCET, DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION WITH THE DISTRICT. BEING DONE TWO WEEKS AGO, IN REGARDS TO THE PRESENCE BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE PERSONNEL. WE DID SOME TESTING AND EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL UNDER THE NORM BY HEALTH AND SAFETY, HEALTH CANADA," HE SAID. "IN LA RIVIRE, IT WAS FOUND AT A VERY MINIMAL LEVEL," SAID DOUCET. CBC NEWS ASKED FOR THE TESTING RESULTS BUT THE DISTRICT WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THEM FRIDAY. BASKIN SAYS HE HAS SEEN THE TESTING GOING ON, BUT STILL WORRIES. "THE KIDS, I MEAN, THEY'RE A LOT YOUNGER THAN WE ARE WITH SMALLER LUNGS AND ALL THIS AND ANY LITTLE THING IN THE SCHOOL, THEY'RE INHALING IT. IF THERE'S ANY DUST OR PARTICLES, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THE KIDS ARE AT RISK TOO," HE SAYS. DOUCET SAYS VISUAL INSPECTIONS OF POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS AREAS ARE DONE ONCE A YEAR. "ONCE A YEAR, EVERY FEBRUARY, NOTICE IS BEING SENT TO PEOPLE IN OUR BUILDING DEPARTMENT TO CHECK ASBESTOS, THE SITUATION OF THE ASBESTOS THERE, AND TO GIVE US A REPORT AND FROM THERE WE DO AN ARRANGEMENT. WHEN THERE'S THINGS TO BE ARRANGED OR FIXED, THAT'S WHAT'S BEING DONE ANNUALLY," HE SAID. IT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY BASKIN, WHO NOW USES A MACHINE TO HELP CLEAR HIS LUNGS. HE SAYS JUST THIS SUMMER A SCHOOL IN TRACADIE BEACH, LA VILLA DES AMIS, WAS EVACUATED AFTER A CONTRACTOR WORKING ON THE HOT WATER TANK FOUND ASBESTOS. ELOI DOUCET SAYS THE ASBESTOS WAS CLEANED THERE TOO. CLASS IS NOW IN SESSION, AND THE SCHOOL IS SAFE, HE SAYS. "THE SCHOOL WAS TESTED AFTER THE REMOVAL WAS DONE. EVERYTHING IS UNDER THE NORM," SAYS DOUCET.
172	SO WHAT HAS THIS SHOWN ME? WELL FIRST, LETS RECAP THE RECENT FOUR WEEKS CHALLENGES: I HAVE BEGUN TO REFINE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SINCE I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY. MY GIRLFRIEND STARTED A NEW JOB AS A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHICH REQUIRES HER TO BE WAKING UP AT 3:30AM MOST MORNINGS (LAST NIGHT WE AWOKE AT 1:45AM). I HAVE BEGUN TO WAKE UP WITH HER, AS OPPOSED TO 6AM, AND ENSURE THAT HER BREAKFAST/ LUNCH ARE READY FOR THE DAY.  THE MENS B CREW, WHICH COMPRISED OF SOME NEW AND EXPERIENCED ROWERS, SECURED FOURTH PLACE. I DONT WORK OUT FOR TWO HOURS, BUT FOR A HALF AN HOUR: A WARM UP ROUTINE CONSISTING OF PUSH UPS, SIT UPS, LEG RAISES, AND TRICEP DIPS. I SPEND THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING IMMERSED IN THE ONLINE WORLD CHECKING EMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS, NETWORKING, WORKING ON WRITING/ EDITING, OR SOME MORNINGS JUST GAMING. AS MY LIFE EVOLVES, SO MUST I. THOSE THAT ARE AFRAID OF CHANGE GET LEFT IN THE DUST. MILAN KUNDERA, CZECH BORN EXISTENTIAL WRITER, POSED THAT: ANYONE WHOSE GOAL IS SOMETHING HIGHER MUST EXPECT SOMEDAY TO SUFFER VERTIGO. WHAT IS VERTIGO? FEAR OF FALLING? NO, VERTIGO IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN FEAR OF FALLING. IT IS THE VOICE OF THE EMPTINESS BELOW US WHICH TEMPTS AND LURES US, IT IS THE DESIRE TO FALL, AGAINST WHICH, TERRIFIED, WE DEFEND OURSELVES. I TIME LAST WEEK WORKING ON EXACTLY WHAT I SET OUT TO DO. I DREW UP A BUSINESS PLAN FOR LAUNCHING MY OWN COMPANY.OVER THE COURSE THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE RESEARCHED SIMILAR PEOPLE TO MYSELF AND THEIR VENTURES. THE VERDICT IS IN: STARTING OUT ON YOUR OWN IS DIFFICULT; IN WAYS THAT I COULD SIT HERE AND DESCRIBE TO YOU, BUT I DONT WANT YOU TO BE AFRAID OF EVER DOING IT.IT REQUIRES PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE AND A LOT OF HARD WORK. AS ANAIS NIN WROTE, LIFE SHRINKS OR EXPANDS IN PROPORTION TO ONES COURAGE. IF YOU DESIRE STRONGLY ENOUGH AND POSSESS THE PROPER COURAGE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME HIS IS ADVENTURE. I PRESENTED MYBUSINESS PLAN TO MY BEST FRIEND OVER COFFEE. WE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF MY PLAN. IT WILL REQUIRE HUGE EFFORT AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR FREE TIME. HOWEVER, AFTER MUCH DELIBERATING, WE HAVE DECIDED TO PURSUE THIS AVENUE AS A MEANS TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE.IT WILL STILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE BUILD UP A PLATFORM FROM WHICH WE CAN NOW, THIS MEANSTHAT THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS OF MY JOURNEY HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS IM WELL ON THE WAY TO LOVING MY LIFE AND FINDING MORE AND MORE WAYS TO BATTLE MY DEPRESSION WHEN IT REARS ITS UGLY HEAD! HOWEVER, IM NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS METAPHOR, THATS A GOOD THING.  (THINGS LIKE PASTA, MILK, PEAS, BELL PEPPERS AND SPINACH WOULD FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY.) AND ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE YOU COVERED WHEN IT COMES TO CROCK COOKER RECIPES. THE ONLY WAY IN LIFE WE COULD EVER HEAR THAT TREE FALL, OR STOP THAT FOREST FIRE, IS TO BE PRESENT; AND THAT MEANS PUTTING YOURSELF INTO SITUATIONS THAT YOU WOULDNT NORMALLY BE IN. THOUGH WHAT IS NORMAL? THE TREND OF A THING TO REMAIN AT A CONSTANT ACCEPTED BY A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN A CERAIN PLACE. BECAUSE NORMAL FOR YOU MAY NOT BE NORMAL FOR ME. BECAUSE NORMAL ALL OVER THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT. SO GO LEARN ABOUT OTHER NORMALS. LIVE. JOURNEY. ADVENTURE. ALL OF LIFE IS ADVENTURE. BUT DYLLON, I DONT HAVE THE TIME TO BE ADVENTURING, OR STARTING NEW THINGS IM AN INDOORS GUY, GOING OUT AND ADVENTURING JUST ISNT FOR ME I LIVE IN A CITY, WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND A TREE IN A CITY IN 2015? THESE ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS. BUT OTHER THAN THE LAST GUY WHO IS STILL CAUGHT UP ON THE TREE METAPHOR, KEEP IN MIND WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY, ADVENTURE. TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER ANY TIME PERIOD IN YOUR LIFE. OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE REMEMBERING THE TIME PERIOD BASED ON THE EVENTS. YOU DONT REMEMBER EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR DAYS BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE WASNT EXCITING; EVERY MINUTE DIDNT LEAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION ON YOU. WHAT STANDS OUT IN LIFE WHAT REALLY GIVES YOU ENERGY AND MAKES YOU GO IS THE UNUSUAL, THE CHANGE, & THE AWESOME. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. WALKING TO THE BATHROOM ON YOUR HANDS. BUILDING A FORT WITH YOUR KIDS. COOKING A FOREIGN DISH FOR AROUND THE WORLD NIGHT FOR YOUR WIFE. SEEING A TREND? REMEMBER: CHALLENGING YOURSELF WILL ONLY PRODUCE POSITIVE EFFECTS. NEW EXPERIENCES CAN ONLY CAUSE US TO GROW. THUSLY, MY CHALLENGE FOR THIS UPCOMING WEEK WILL BE TO ADVENTURE AT LEAST ONCE A DAY, AND DO SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING AT LEAST ONCEEACH WEEK. LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY, AND THE CURE IS CURIOSITY. CURIOSITY IS THE FUEL OF THE SOUL. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU ARE NOT SURE WHERE TO START, WRITE OR TWEET TO ME! AND COME BACK FOR NEXT WEEKS ARTICLE! PHOTO: SOPHIE FFRENCH-CONSTANT /FLICKR THE POST 52 WEEK PLAN TO COMPLETELY TURN A MANS LIFE AROUND: WEEK 5 APPEARED FIRST ON THE GOOD MEN PROJECT . LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES  DISEASE IS MYSTERY & THECURE IS CURIOSITY. HOW SEEKING CHANGE HAS BROUGHT ME EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEENLOOKING FOR.  EXACTLY 100 DAYS AGO, HE CLIMBED THE PODIUM AT EAGLE SQUARE IN ABUJA AND GOT INAUGURATED AS PRESIDENT, 30 YEARS AFTER HE HAD BEEN TOPPLED FROM POWER AS MILITARY HEAD OF STATE.  TACK ENDOVASCULAR SYSTEM AND TACK ARE TRADEMARKS OF INTACT VASCULAR, INC. IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING MY JOURNEY, CHECK OUT THE PREVIOUS PIECES OF THE STORY  HERE: WK1 , WK2 , WK3 , WK4 WEVE ALL HEARD THE SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, DOES IT MAKE A SOUND? THIS QUESTION DRAWSON MANY NOTIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE SELF, AND THAT IF ONE DOES NOT EXPERIENCE SOMETHING, THAN THE QUESTION IS DID ITREALLY HAPPEN? BUT LETS GO BACK AND THINK INSTEAD OF THIS SCENARIO: IF LIGHTING STRIKES IN THE WOODS AND STARTS A FIRE, BUT NO ONE IS AROUND TO SEE IT, WILL IT STILL BURN A PART OF THE FOREST DOWN? THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS YES. OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY DOES NOT DICTATE WHAT IS REAL, BUT MERELY WHAT WE ARE PERCEIVING AS AN ACTIVE PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE EXIST. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES, HOW DO WE INCLUDE THIS LIGHTNING STRIKE IN OUR LIVES SO THAT WE CAN BE AN ACTIVE FORCE IN STOPPING THE FOREST FIRE? THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. SINCE WE CANT CHANGE WHERE THE LIGHTNING STRIKES, WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE OUT LOOKING FOR IT. IN SHORT, IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD, WE HAVE TO BE AN ACTIVE PIECE IN IT. OUR BODIES ARE TEMPLES FOR OUR MINDS FLESHY PRISONS WITH WHICH WE TRAVERSE THIS LIFE IN ORDER TO SEEK BALANCE AND PEACE AND FREEDOM. HOWEVER, IN THIS BELIEF, OUR BODIES ARE STILL PLAYERS IN THE GAME OF LIFE; THEY ARE THETEMPLE WITHIN WHICH OUR MINDS RESIDE, SO SHOULDNT WE BE TREATING OUR TEMPLES LIKE TEMPLES?! AND BY THIS, I MEAN TO PUSH OUR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND STAMINA TO THEIR LIMITS AND TO SEEK CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT ON THIS PHYSICAL FORM IN WHICH EXIST. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUS AAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. LETS PLAY THE WHAT IF GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS: WHAT IF YOU ARE WALKING TO YOUR CAR AND THREE PEOPLE GET THE DROP ON YOU; COULD YOU DEFEND YOURSELF? WHAT IF YOUR HOME CATCHES ON FIRE AND THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THE SECOND STORY WINDOW; DO YOU KNOW HOW TO JUMP AND LAND SAFELY? WHAT IF YOUR SON WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM? WHAT IF YOU WORKED A FEW MINUTES FROM HOME AND YOUR WIFE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND NEEDED YOU HOME IMMEDIATELY,BUT YOUR CAR WAS DEAD IN THE PARKING LOT, COULD YOU RUN ALL THE WAY HOME? CAN YOU PROTECT THE ONES YOU LOVE? COULD YOU OUTRUN SOMETHING HUNTING YOU DOWN? CAN YOU SURVIVE ON YOUR OWN WHEN TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE WITHIN REACH TO HELP YOU? I SPENT THE WEEK PRACTICING HUAQUAN AND RUNNING. MY BEST FRIEND, ALSO AN ADVENTURE ENTHUSIAST, AND I SPENT THE WEEKENDCLIMBING THROUGH AERIAL OBSTACLE COURSES IN THE TREES OF THE BERKSHIRES IN MASSACHUSETTS.AFTER THE LONG WEEKEND, I BEGAN THE WEEK LIKE I ALWAYS DO, EXHAUSTED; BUT I COULD FEEL THE HAPPINESS IN EACH SORE MUSCLE FIBER. THE ELONGATED SIGH AS ONE SETTLES IN TO THE COUCH AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, OR INTO A HOT TUB ON THE FIRST DAY OF VACATION, THAT IS WHAT EACH OF MY MUSCLES FEELS. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUSAAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY.
173	REVISION - NOW HERRERA, CARRICK AND VALENCIA HAVE MINOR ISSUES. WE HAVE TO TAKE A DECISION AND I WILL TAKE THAT, MORE OR LESS, ON WEDNESDAY." MANCHESTER UNITED WELCOME THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE BACK TO OLD TRAFFORD ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN LOUIS VAN GAAL'S MEN HOST GERMAN CLUB WOLFSBURG IN THEIR GROUP B CLASH. THE GAME WILL BE THE CLUB'S FIRST HOME MATCH IN THE TOURNAMENT SINCE THEY LOST TO BAYERN MUNICH AT OLD TRAFFORD IN 2014, AND THE RED DEVILS WILL BE LOOKING FOR A WIN AFTER SUFFERING DEFEAT IN THEIR OPENING CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MATCH AWAY TO PSV EINDHOVEN. THAT GAME SAW UNITED SURRENDER A 1-0 LEAD BEFORE EVENTUALLY BEING BEATEN 2-1, BUT IT WILL PERHAPS BE MORE REMEMBERED FOR THE HORROR TACKLE THAT LEFT LUKE SHAW WITH A DOUBLE FRACTURE OF HIS LEG - AND OUT FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME. DESPITE BEING WITHOUT THE FULL-BACK FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, UNITED WILL BE IN A CONFIDENT MOOD AHEAD OF THEIR CLASH WITH WOLFSBURG AFTER GOING TOP OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE ON SUNDAY WITH A 3-0 WIN OVER SUNDERLAND. THEIR RECENT STRING OF VICTORIES HAS LED TO UNITED MIDFIELDER BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER ADMITTING THE CLUB HAVE THE STRENGTH TO WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE ALTHOUGH THEIR OPPOSITION ON WEDNESDAY WON'T BE EASY TO BEAT . WOLFSBURG SIT IN FOURTH PLACE IN THE BUNDESLIGA STANDINGS, BUT SUFFERED AN EMBARRASSING 5-1 THRASHING AT THE HANDS OF BAYERN MUNICH LAST WEEK, WHICH SAW ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI SCORE FIVE GOALS IN NINE SECOND-HALF MINUTES TO STUN THE VISITORS AT THE ALLIANZ ARENA. HOWEVER, WOLFSBURG COACH DIETER HECKING INSISTED ON TUESDAY HE ISNT WORRIED BY THE PROSPECT OF COMING TO OLD TRAFFORD AND TRYING TO SECURE A RESULT ALTHOUGH HE CONCEDED IT WILL NOT BE EASY. BUT WHO WILL COME OUT ON TOP? STAY TUNED TO STANDARD SPORT FOR ALL THE ACTION! PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT FOR THE LIVE BLOG TO LOAD WHAT THEY SAID VAN GAAL "I HAVE TO CONSIDER IF I WANT TO USE THESE PLAYERS," HETOLD MUTV. "WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PLAYERS BECAUSE WE ARE PLAYING THREE MATCHES EVERY WEEK. "IT'S THE ACCUMULATION OF TIREDNESS - WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT. I HAVE TO CONSIDER EVERY WEEK IF I CAN USE A PLAYER OR NOT.
174	THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPPED BY NEARLY THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS BETWEEN 2013 AND 2104, ACCORDING THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, FROM 13.3 TO 10.4 PERCENT. PUT ANOTHER WAY, 8.8 MILLION MORE PEOPLE WERE INSURED IN 2014 THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. THE ANNUAL STUDY FROM CENSUS IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE MEASURE OF HEALTH INSURANCE, ALTHOUGH A CHANGE IN THE WAY HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED MAKE THIS YEAR'S REPORT COMPARABLE TO 2013 BUT NOT EARLIER YEARS. CENSUS OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT A DIFFERENT ANNUAL SURVEY THAT HAS ASKED HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THIS TO BE THE BIGGEST DROP IN THE UNINSURED SINCE AT LEAST 2008. OTHERS SAY THE SIZABLE INCREASE IN AMERICANS WITH INSURANCE DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL HEALTH LAW IS UNPRECEDENTED SINCE THE CREATION OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID 50 YEARS AGO. "IT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DROP EVER," SAID PAUL FRONSTIN, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH RESEARCH AT THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WHO HAS BEEN STUDYING THE UNINSURED SINCE 1993. MORE IMPORTANTLY, SAID DIANE ROWLAND, HEAD OF THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION'S COMMISSION ON MEDICAID AND THE UNINSURED, "THE GAINS ARE EXACTLY WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WERE," MEANING THE LARGEST INCREASES IN COVERAGE WERE IN THOSE GROUPS WITH TRADITIONALLY THE HIGHEST RATES OF UNINSURANCE YOUNGER, WORKING-AGE ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH LOW AND MODERATE INCOMES. (KAISER HEALTH NEWS IS AN EDITORIALLY INDEPENDENT PROGRAM OF THE FOUNDATION.) DESPITE THE GAINS, THE CENSUS STUDY FOUND THAT 33 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT INSURANCE. WHILE THE GAINS IN INSURANCE COVERAGE WERE WIDESPREAD, THEY WEREN'T EQUAL IN EVERY CATEGORY. NOT SURPRISINGLY, AMONG TYPES OF COVERAGE, THE BIGGEST INCREASES WERE IN PEOPLE COVERED BY MEDICAID (UP 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 62 MILLION PEOPLE) AND PEOPLE BUYING THEIR OWN HEALTH PLANS (UP 3.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 14.6 MILLION PEOPLE). EXPANDING MEDICAID AND MAKING PRIVATE INSURANCE EASIER TO PURCHASE BY THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER COVERAGE WERE KEY FOCUSES OF THE HEALTH LAW. BUT THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REMAINS EMPLOYERS. THAT NUMBER HELD STEADY AT AROUND 55 PERCENT. THE UNINSURED RATE DROPPED FOR EVERY AGE, INCOME AND ETHNIC GROUP AND IN EVERY STATE, ALTHOUGH, AGAIN, SOME GAINED MORE THAN OTHERS. THOSE AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE WERE MORE LIKELY TO GAIN INSURANCE THAN THOSE WITH MORE RESOURCES. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN $25,000 PER YEAR DROPPED 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE RATE FOR THOSE WITH INCOMES BETWEEN $25,000 AND $50,000 DROPPED 5 POINTS. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR THOSE EARNING MORE THAN $100,000 ANNUALLY DROPPED TOO, BUT BY LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT. SIMILARLY, THE UNINSURED RATE FOR THE WHITE NON-HISPANIC POPULATION (THE ETHNICITY MOST LIKELY TO HAVE INSURANCE) DROPPED BY JUST OVER 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS, WHILE THE RATES FOR BLACKS, ASIAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS DROPPED BY MORE THAN 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS EACH. AMONG STATES, MASSACHUSETTS (WHICH BEGAN REQUIRING MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE INSURANCE IN 2006) HAD THE LOWEST RATE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT COVERAGE, AT 3.3 PERCENT, WHILE TEXAS CONTINUED TO LEAD THE NATION WITH THE HIGHEST UNINSURED RATE 19.1 PERCENT. STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, HOWEVER, SAW OVERALL GAINS IN INSURANCE NOT JUST MEDICAID THAT WERE LARGER THAN THOSE THAT DIDN'T. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE WITH INCOMES ABOVE POVERTY BUT LESS THAN FOUR TIMES THAT (MOST OF WHOM AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID) STILL SAW AN OVERALL DECLINE IN UNINSURANCE OF 6.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, WHILE STATES THAT DIDN'T TAKE THAT OPTION SAW THAT RATE DROP BY ONLY 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS.
175	THAT GAME YOU USED TO PLAY IS GETTING A FULL-LENGTH FEATURE AND THE TRAILER GIVES US A FIRST LOOK AT FAVOURITE CHARACTERS LIKE NAMELESS RED BIRD AND BLACK BLOWY-UP BIRD ANGRY BIRDS IS THE RED-HOT IPHONE APP OF THE MOMENT.  WESTRIDGE ELECTRIC IS THE ONLY ELECTRICAL CONTRACTOR IN WESTERN CANADA AUTHORIZED TO PERMANENTLY FIX ALUMINUM WIRING WITH COPALUM. ITS LITERALLY A ONE-IN-A-MILLION SENSATION. YOUR FRIENDS CANT STOP PLAYING IT. THE WORLDS EDGIEST COMEDIANS CANT STOP REFERENCING IT AND NOW ITS HEADING TO THE BIG SCREEN! WHAT SORT OF BLOCKBUS OH, HANG ON, MY FAULT, SORRY. I THOUGHT IT WAS 2012. LET ME START AGAIN. ANGRY BIRDS IS THAT IPHONE GAME THAT PEOPLE USED TO PLAY A LOT THREE YEARS AGO BUT DONT ANY MORE. AND NOW ITS GOING TO BE A FILM. AND THERES A TRAILER FOR IT. THERE, THATS BETTER.  THE GAP WAS ALSO VISIBLE IN JAPANESE OPTIONS MARKETS. STILL, WHILE WERE HERE, LETS GIVE THE ANGRY BIRDS TRAILER A CLOSER LOOK. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST WE OPEN WITH A SHOT OF THE CHARACTER WERE MOST LIKELY TO REMEMBER FROM THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED ANGRY BIRDS SEVERAL YEARS AGO NAMELESS RED BIRD. HERES NAMELESS RED BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. SO FAR, THIS IS A FILM ABOUT A CARTOON BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST ALSO PRESENT, THREE SEXY BIRDS. AT LEAST I ASSUME THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY.  NOT THIS WEEK, HERITAGE. DONT DO THIS WHILE NEBULOUS ALMOST-BESTIALITY IS SUCH A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE. GET IT TOGETHER.  AND THEY WERE AIMING ALL THEIR RED-HOT SEXUALITY AT THAT HUNKY SORT-OF BLUEISH BIRD. I HOPE THE RED BIRDS OK, AND DIDNT MISTAKENLY THINK THE OTHER BIRDS WERE ACTUALLY COMING ON TO HIM. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST AH.  NOW IM 0-FOR-FOUR, NO RBI. HE DID. AND BY THE LOOK OF IT HE HASNT TAKEN THE REJECTION WELL. IN FACT, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT HES NOW A FAIRLY ANGRY BIRD. SEE WHAT I DID THERE? THAT WAS CLEVER OF ME WASNT IT? SO ANGRY IS NAMELESS RED BIRD, IN FACT, THAT HE APPEARS TO HAVE ENROLLED IN SOME SORT OF ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME, ALONG WITH AN ANNOYING YELLOW BIRD PLAYED BY THE ANNOYING MAN WHO PLAYED THE ANNOYING SNOWMAN IN FROZEN. TYPECASTING ISSUES ASIDE, THOUGH, THIS LITERALLY SEEMS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE A FILM ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. THATS LITERALLY WHAT THIS FILM IS. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR THE BLACK BLOWY-UP UP BIRD IS ALSO ANGRY, BECAUSE HES JUST BLOWN UP. WOW, THESE PEOPLE HAVE REALLY GRABBED THE WHOLE ANGRY BIRDS IDEA BY ITS MOST LITERAL END AND RUN WITH IT, HAVENT THEY? FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST BUT ITS OK, BECAUSE HERES A PIG, WHICH YOU MIGHT REMEMBER IS THE MORTAL ENEMY OF THE ANGRY BIRDS. PRETTY SOON THESE PIGS WILL BE CONSTRUCTING DANGEROUSLY RAMSHACKLE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES, AND THE BIRDS WILL KAMIKAZE INTO THEM AS REVENGE. IF MY MEMORY IS CORRECT, THE BIRDS ALL DIE AS SOON AS THEYVE BEEN CATAPULTED AT THE PIGS, WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE WILL ACTUALLY TURN UP TO BE A SORROWFUL MEDITATION ON THE FUTILITY OF WAR. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, WRONG AGAIN. ITS JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE IS LITERALLY JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME BIRDS WHO GET ANGRY SOMETIMES. HOPEFULLY CLEAR FLAWS WILL ALL BE ADDRESSED ADDRESSED AND IRONED OUT BY THE TIME THEY MAKE A FILM ABOUT YOUR SECOND-FAVOURITE IPHONE APP, GOOGLE MAPS.

179	TLC HAS A NEW SHOW, SEX IN PUBLIC, STARRING THERAPIST JILL DICTROW, WHO GETS UNSUSPECTING PEOPLE TO OPEN UP TO HER ABOUT THEIR SEX LIVES. THE SHOW PROMPTS PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL AND EMOTIONAL ISSUES, BUT HOW FAR IS TOO FAR WHEN IT COMES TO TALKING ABOUT SEX ON TV? SOME BELIEVE THE SERIES IS A BAD CHOICE FOR TLC. TIM WINTER, PRESIDENT OF THE PARENTS TELEVISION COUNCIL, SEES THE SHOW AS A DESPERATE MOVE FOR THE CHANNEL. TLC ONCE STOOD FOR THE LEARNING CHANNELAND NOW IT STANDS FOR TOTALLY LUDACRIS CONTENT, HE TOLD FOX411. ITS PATHETIC AND ITS DESPERATE. ITS A STRATEGIC BLUNDER. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BRAND FOR YOUR PROGRAMING AND A PROGRAM LIKE SEX IN PUBLIC IS GOING TO HELP NOBODY. IT MAY BE CLEVER IN TERMS OF OH THEYRE GOING TO A FOOD COURT TO TALK TO ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL APPETITE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS EXPLICIT CONTENT, ITS ON A NETWORK THAT HAS BUILT A BRAND ON OTHER TYPES OF CONTENT. I JUST DONT THINK ITS GOING TO FIT. THE PTC SENT OUT A PRESS RELEASE ON TUESDAY URGING ADVERTISERS TO STEER CLEAR OF SEX IN PUBLIC AND OTHER TLC SHOWS THAT ARE CLEARLY DESIGNED TO SHOCK AND ACCELERATE. BUT DICTROW TOLD US SHE BELIEVES THE SHOW IS DOING A GOOD THING BY HIGHLIGHTING A TABOO SUBJECT. [THE SHOW IS] TALKING ABOUT SEX THE WAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT SO WE CAN OPENLY TALK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES AND CLOSED DOORS SO PEOPLE ARE HAVING SATISFYING SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS. [WERE] NOT TALKING ABOUT IT IN A WAY THAT IS CRUDE AND UNKIND, DICTROW SAID. NEVERTHELESS, SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME PEOPLE CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE DISCUSSING SEX SO OPENLY. I THINK SEX HAS A BAD CONNOTATION FOR TWO REASONS. ON THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT, SOME PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GIVING THEIR VIRGINITY AWAY, SHE SAID. AND I THINK PORN UNFORTUNATELY HAS GIVEN SEX A SORT OF DEGRADING FACTOR DICTROW SAID, IN REGARDS TO THE BACKLASH THE SHOW HAS RECEIVED FROM THE PTC, THAT CRITICS OF THE SERIES SHOULD WATCH IT BEFORE THEY BASH IT. FIRST OF ALL ARE THEY BASING IT ON THE CLIPS OF THE SHOW OR WHAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SHOW IS? WELL, ALL I CAN SAY IS WATCH THE SHOW. IM NOT DEFENDING THE SHOW UNTIL THEY SEE IT. I REFUSE. SHE ARGUED THAT THE SHOW FOCUSES ON HELPING PEOPLE. NOT ONLY DID I DO SOME THERAPY IN THE SHOW, BUT THERE WAS NOT ONE PERSON THAT DID NOT THANK ME AFTER AND SAY OH MY GOD THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT. THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME THOSE QUESTIONS TO MAKE ME THINK. SHE ADDED THAT ALL SHE WANTS IS TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING A FULFILLING SEXUAL LIFE IS SOMETHING TO BE OPEN AND HAPPY ABOUT. I THINK YOU HAVE TO KNOW EVERYONE COMES WITH BAGGAGE AND YOU DONT REALLY KNOW WHAT GOES ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT REALLY IS THE TRUTH, SHE SAID. HAVING A SEXUAL FULFILLING SEX LIFE IS A GREAT ASPECT TO HAVE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

181	GAINESVILLE - HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT RECEIVED NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR ITS NEW LOGO DESIGN PROJECT DURING LAST WEEK'S 4CMA CONFERENCE IN ATLANTA. 3CMA, THE CITY-COUNTY COMMUNICATIONS AND MARKETING ASSOCIATION, IS A NETWORK OF PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC COMMUNICATORS AND MARKETERS FROM ALL OVER THE NATION. THE ORGANIZATION'S ANNUAL SAVVY AWARDS COMPETITION RECOGNIZES OUTSTANDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACHIEVEMENTS IN COMMUNICATIONS, PUBLIC-SECTOR MARKETING AND CITIZEN-GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS.  "THE LOGO DESIGN PROJECT WAS TRULY A GRASSROOTS EFFORT, LAUNCHED WITH THE INPUT OF CITIZENS AND EMPLOYEES," HALL COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR RANDY KNIGHTON SAID. "WE ARE HONORED TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE THOROUGH AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROCESS WE USED TO PRODUCE A QUALITY BRAND THAT TRULY EXEMPLIFIES HALL COUNTY'S UNIQUE ASSETS." THE LOGO FEATURES TWO FLOWING BLUE STRIPES, A SOFT GREEN ARC AND THE IMAGE OF A RISING YELLOW SUN, COMPLETE WITH "RAYS" IN THE SHAPE OF MECHANICAL COGS. EACH ELEMENT OF THE LOGO HIGHLIGHTS A DISTINCT CHARACTERISTIC OF HALL COUNTY.  BEN-AMI SAID THAT WOULD CAUSE TROUBLE. "THE BLUE STREAKS REPRESENT LAKE LANIER, AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF HALL COUNTY'S LANDSCAPE AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE," SAID KATIE CRUMLEY, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER FOR HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT. "THE BLUE LINES ALSO RESEMBLE ROADWAYS, GIVING A NOD TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE HALL COUNTY PROVIDES AND MAINTAINS FOR ITS CITIZENS." CRUMLEY SAID THE GREEN ARC IS REMINISCENT OF HALL COUNTY'S LOCATION AT THE FOOTHILLS OF THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS AND THE AREA'S RICH AGRICULTURAL HERITAGE. THE RISING SUN REPRESENTS THE COUNTY'S CURRENT STATE OF GROWTH AND POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. "THE MECHANICAL COGS SEEN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SUN ALSO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE FACT THAT HALL COUNTY IS MOVING FORWARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND THRIVE IN THE FUTURE," SHE SAID.  IT WILL ALSO GIVE THE PERSON THE CHANCE TO CLEAR UP ANY MISCOMMUNICATION OR MISUNDERSTANDING THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN YOU. THE JUDGES FOR THE 5CMA SAVVY COMPETITION PRAISED HALL COUNTY FOR CITIZEN AND EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT AND BTHEIR IMPRESSIVE BRAND IDENTITY STANDARD GUIDE. HALL COUNTY BEGAN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A NEW LOGO IN 2013 WITH A AVAILABLE ON THE COUNTY'S WEBSITE, HALLCOUNTY.ORG.  LAST YEAR, THE RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, ORRIAA,REPORTED OVER 100,000 COPYRIGHT INFRINGING FILES WERE AVAILABLE FOR FREE ON SHAREBEAST. THE SURVEY ASKED FOR FEEDBACK FROM HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND HALL COUNTY RESIDENTS ABOUT WHAT IMAGES, COLORS, FONTS AND MORE SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN THE NEW DESIGN. THE SURVEY ALSO ASKED WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN A FOCUS GROUP DEDICATED TO EXPOUNDING ON THE SURVEY RESPONSES.  FOLLOWING THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF BCITIZEN AND EMPLOYEE INPUT, FORUM COMMUNICATIONS,A LOCAL FULL-SERVICE STRATEGIC MARKETING AGENCY , WAS HIREDD AS A CONSULTANT FOR THE ACTUAL DESIGN OF THE LOGO.  THESE PROMISES ARE APPROPRIATED BY FAITH AND THE FAITH COMES FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT GOD PROMISES YOU. USING INPUT GENERATED FROM CITIZEN SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS, SEVERAL LOGO OPTIONS WERE DEVELOPED. THOSE OPTIONS WERE REVISED AND NARROWED DOWN BY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND HALL COUNTY STAFF UNTIL THE FINAL LOGO DESIGN WAS COMPLETE. THE NEW LOGO DESIGN AND SLOGAN WERE A PART OF A LARGER REBRANDING EFFORT, WHICH INCLUDED A REDESIGN OF THE COUNTY WEBSITE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONAL VALUES AND THE RELEASE OF A HALL COUNTY PROMOTIONAL VIDEO.
182	WHETHER YAKUB MEMON DESERVED TO BE PUT TO DEATH, AND WHETHER IN CARRYING OUT THE SENTENCE, THE STATE WAS ACTING IN A DISCRIMINATORY WAY, ARE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEBATED PASSIONATELY AND ARTICULATELY ACROSS MEDIA. AT A MORE FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL, THE DEATH SENTENCE ITSELF IS COMING UNDER SCRUTINY, WITH MANY ARGUING THAT THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THAT MODE OF PUNISHMENT IN ANY COUNTRY THAT WANTS TO CALL ITSELF CIVILIZED. THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY WAS YAKUB MEMON HANGED BUT THAT SO MANY TOOK SUCH PLEASURE IN IT, IS SEEN TO BE A TROUBLING SIGN. IS THE DESIRE TO PUT A TERRORIST WHO HELPED MURDER HUNDREDS OF INNOCENTS TO DEATH A SIGN OF A BRUTAL AND PRIMITIVE BLOODLUST? WHAT EXPLAINS THE GREAT INTEREST TAKEN IN METING OUT SUCH AN EXTREME FORM OF PUNISHMENT TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING? THOSE THAT OPPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY, EVEN IN THE RAREST OF RARE CASES ARGUE THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE NO BUSINESS DELIBERATELY TAKING THE LIVES OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. APART FROM THE MORAL DIMENSIONS OF THE ISSUE, THERE ARE MORE PRACTICAL REASONS INNOCENTS CAN MISTAKENLY BE EXECUTED AS HISTORY BEARS EVIDENCE, A LIFE SPENT IN PRISON MIGHT ACTUALLY BE MORE OF A PUNISHMENT THAN DEATH, AND IN THE CASE OF TERRORISM IN PARTICULAR, DEATH MAY NOT BE A DETERRENT AT ALL FOR DYING IS OFTEN VERY MUCH A PART OF THE IDEA OF TERRORISM. LOOKED AT FROM THE OTHER SIDE, THE DESIRE TO HIT BACK AT THOSE THAT COMMIT CRIMES THAT CANNOT BE COMPREHENDED IN NORMAL HUMAN TERMS IS NOT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND. THE DEATH PENALTY IS AN INARTICULATE AND EXTREMELY LIMITED WAY OF EXPRESSING HELPLESSNESS AND REVULSION AT ACTIONS THAT CANNOT BE LOCATED INSIDE THE AMBIT OF HUMANITY. THE LANGUAGE THAT SURROUNDS THE SUPPORT FOR THE DEATH PENALTY MAY REEK OF MACHISMO AND EXAGGERATED BRAVADO, BUT AT AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL, IT IS AN ADMISSION OF THE INADEQUACY OF ANY RESPONSE. PUTTING SOMEONE TO DEATH IS THE MOST WE CAN DO, EVEN IF THAT FEELS GROSSLY INSUFFICIENT. THE RATIONAL ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD THAT IT ACTS AS A DETERRENCE IS IN PART THE FIG LEAF WORN BY A MORE PRIMITIVE URGE. CONCEPTUALLY, THE RIGHT TO EXISTENCE IS NOT UNDERWRITTEN BY SOCIETY; ONE IS BORN INTO SOCIETY AND IN ORDER TO RECEIVE ITS PROTECTION AND PATRONAGE, ONE MUST FOLLOW ITS RULES. WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL ACTS IN A WAY THAT CROSSES BOUNDARIES DRAWN CULTURALLY, SOME PUNISHMENT IS GUARANTEED. IT COULD TAKE PLACE USING INSTRUMENTS OF A CULTURAL KIND OR OF A LEGAL KIND. EXTREME ACTS OF DISOBEDIENCE ATTRACT THE ULTIMATE REACTION- THAT OF BEING PUT TO DEATH. IT DOESNT MATTER WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION- IT IS SIMPLY THE MOST THAT SOCIETY BELIEVES IT CAN DO. DEATH EXHAUSTS THE HUMAN IMAGINATION, AND PEOPLE THAT ACT IN A WAY WHERE THEIR HUMANITY IS SUSPECT ARE DEALT WITH BY WITHDRAWING THEIR RIGHT TO EXIST. AT A HUMAN LEVEL, THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT TERRORISM PROVOKES REACTIONS TODAY OF THE MOST PRONOUNCED KIND BECAUSE AS A CRIME, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE SENSE OF AT A HUMAN LEVEL. TERRORISM MARKETS FEAR, AND TERRORISTS HARVEST ITS CONSEQUENCES. RANDOM KILLING OF INNOCENTS TO MAKE A PURELY SYMBOLIC POINT DESTROYS ALL NOTIONS OF CAUSE AND EFFECT- THE ARBITRARINESS OF THE ACTION AS WELL ITS LACK OF POINTEDNESS MAKES RETALIATION OF A POINTED KIND VERY DIFFICULT. NOTHING IS MORE VEXING THAN THE INSTITUTION OF THE SUICIDE BOMBER FOR HERE THE TERRORIST BEGINS WHERE CIVILIZATION ENDS- BY PLACING NO VALUE ON HIS LIFE. THE FACT THAT EVEN WHERE IT IS PATENTLY CLEAR THAT DEATH IS NO PUNISHMENT, FOR A SUICIDE BOMBER PRESUMPTIVELY EMBRACES THAT IDEA, THE PUNISHMENT SOUGHT IS THE DEATH SENTENCE REVEALS THAT IT HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH DETERRENCE. THE DEATH PENALTY IN THIS CASE MIGHT BE A CONFESSION OF INCOMPREHENSION, RATHER THAN A SHOW OF STRENGTH THAT IT PURPORTS TO BE, BUT THE NEED TO EMPLOY THE MOST EXTREME RESPONSE THAT IS AVAILABLE, IS ONE THAT IS VISIBLE IN THE PUBLIC SUPPORT THAT THIS MODE OF PUNISHMENT RECEIVES. IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY SENSIBLE WAY OF REACTING TO TERRORISM, THE MOST EXTREME WAY PERMITTED BY SOCIETY, IS CHOSEN. IN THEORY, THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM SEEKS TO CONCEPTUALISE PUNISHMENT AS A DISPASSIONATE RESPONSE TO INFRACTIONS COMMITTED BY INDIVIDUALS; IT AFFIXES RESPONSIBILITY AND APPORTIONS PUNITIVE MEASURES DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE CRIME AND THE CRIMINAL. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEALING WITH THE CRIME RESTS ENTIRELY ON THE STATE; THE VICTIMS ROLE IS LIMITED TO BEING THE REASON FOR THE PROCEEDINGS. THE CRIME IS IN SOME SENSES, ALWAYS AGAINST THE STATE, WHICH IS MEANT TO ACT CLINICALLY. IT IS WHEN CRIME EVOKES A PERSONALIZED AND MORE HOT-BLOODED RESPONSE THAT PUNISHMENT TAKES ON A DIFFERENT, ALTOGETHER MORE AGGRESSIVE HUE. IN THIS SCENARIO, THE VICTIMS RIGHTS ARE OFTEN INVOKED TO DEMAND MORE MUSCULAR PUNISHMENT. IN INDIA TODAY, LYNCH MOBS OF ALL KINDS ARE IN FAVOUR, BE THEY ON MAINSTREAM MEDIA, SOCIAL MEDIA OR IN EVERYDAY LIFE. HAIR TRIGGER REACTIONS ARE COMMON, BE THEY ON THE ROAD OR IN MEDIA, AND IN THIS CONTEXT, IT IS HARDLY SURPRISING THAT THE DEATH SENTENCE IS A VALUED MEMBER OF SOCIETY. COMPASSION BECOMES AN UNAFFORDABLE LUXURY, FOR IT NEEDS A CERTAIN SENSE OF TRANQUIL SELF-ASSURANCE, A COMMODITY THAT IS IN SCARCE SUPPLY IN THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE TODAY. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN A SENSATION HUNGRY MEDIA AND ITS CONSUMERS WHO HAVE THEMSELVES BECOME TINPOT PRODUCERS OF INCREASINGLY CANTANKEROUS OPINION HAS CREATED A RISING SPIRAL OF UNHAPPY OUTRAGE. THOSE THAT ARGUE AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY ARE FIGHTING A LOST CAUSE AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MERITS OF THEIR ARGUMENT. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT THE TIME. AS A SOCIETY, WE ARE PERPLEXED, AFRAID AND WE ARE ANGRY, AND WE HAVE SOPHISTICATED WAYS OF INFECTING EACH OTHER WITH UNHAPPINESS, AND SOME PEOPLE WILL DIE BECAUSE OF THAT.

I HAD TO LEARN TO WALK AGAIN," SHE SAYS, HER VOICE BREAKING AS SHE DESCRIBES HER DAILY STRUGGLE. "I WAKE EVERY DAY IN PAIN. I WILL NEVER RUN COMFORTABLY. AND WHEN MY KIDS WANT ME TO PLAY, I CAN'T.  SEP, 2015 /A ITS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT JAPANESE FOOD AND BEER ARE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN.ONE MAY EVEN SAY, WASSHOI!, AN EXCLAMATION OF EXCITEMENT OR CELEBRATION IN JAPANESE. I'M IN TOO MUCH PIN." SARAH SAYS SHE IS HARASSED DAILY AND ADMITS SHE FEARS FOR HER LIFE; SHE SAYS THE POLICE HAVE IGNORED HER CONCERNS. "HE [EX-PARTNER]HAS TOLD ME HE WANTS TO KILL HIS EX-WIFE. HE HASTOLD ME THE WAYS HE WANTS TO DO IT. BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE POLICE THEY SAID IT'S NORMAL FOR PEOPLE TO SAY THEY WANT TO KILL THEIR EX-PARTNERS, AND IT IS A COMMON FIGURE OF SPEECH." NEARLY A QUARTER OF AUSTRALIAN WOMEN SAY THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME FORM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHILST THEY WERE PREGNANT AND HALF OF THEM EXPERIENCED ABUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING THAT PERIOD. JULIE-ANN, 28, IS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING PREGNANCY. "THE ABUSE BEGAN NINE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS 12 WEEKS PREGNANT," JULIE-ANN SAYS, SPEAKING OUT ABOUT HER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. "THINGS WERE FINE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP UNTIL THE 12 WEEK MARK AND THEN, I DON'T KNOW, IT JUST WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE." STATISTICS SHOW LEAVING AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AND PREGNANCY ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS TIMES FOR A WOMAN EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. JULIE-ANN EXPERIENCED ABUSE FOR NINE AND A HALF YEARS FOLLOWING FIRST PREGNANCY THROUGH FEAR OF LEAVING. EVENTUALLY SHE ESCAPED AND MOVED INTERSTATE. "IT FELT SAFER TO STAY," SHE SAYS ABOUT HER NINE YEARS OF ABUSE. "BECAUSE HE WOULD LOSE CONTROL. IF I WAS AWAY I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS, WHAT HE WAS THINKING, OR WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO." FAMILY VIOLENCE ACADEMIC DEBORAH WALSH HAS SPECIFICALLY STUDIED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREGNANCY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SAYS PREGNANCY OFTEN OFFERS HOPE THAT AN ABUSIVE PARTNER WILL CHANGE. "A BABY OFFERS HOPE FOR THE FUTURE AND A HOPE FOR CHANGE," MS WALSH SAID. MS WALSH SAID DUE TO THIS HOPE WOMEN HAVE WHILE PREGNANT MANY PROCESSES INVOLVED IN SCREENING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WOULD NOT BE TOTALLY EFFECTIVE. "WE NEED TO SUPPORT MEN IN OUR COMMUNITY TO MANAGE THEIR FEELINGS APPROPRIATELY, SAFELY, AND NON-VIOLENTLY, IN A WAY THAT IT IS NOT SEEN AS AN ATTACK ON MASCULINITY, BUT INSTEAD A PART OF MS WALSH SAID. "UNLESS WE SUPPORT OUR MEN (TO) DEAL WITH THEIR EMOTIONS, FEELINGS AND ASSOCIATED BEHAVIOURS, THIS IS GOING TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION CENTRE DIRECTOR AMY COMPTON-KEEN SAID PREGNANCY AND POST-BIRTH WERE BOTH VULNERABLE TIMES FOR WOMEN AND IT WAS COMMON FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO OCCUR AT THESE TIMES. "MANY PREGNANT WOMEN DO NOT REPORT, DISCLOSE, OR SEEK HELP DUE TO FEELING VULNERABLE AND UNCERTAIN OF THE FUTURE," MSCOMPTON-KEEN SAID. "THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE MAY INCLUDE PERIODS WHERE THEIR PARTNER IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE, THEIR CHILD, AND BECOMING A PARENT, AND THEY MAY MAKE PROMISES. "THESE PROMISES ARE POWERFUL AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A WOMAN REMAINING IN AN ABUSIVE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE DISTRESSED CAN PHONE LIFELINE ON 131 114.

FOR INDEPENDENT NEWS COVERAGE, BE SURE TO OUR THE RISK OF ENDURING ANOTHER PREMATURE BIRTH IS VERY REAL FOR MARTINE*, WHO IS SIX MONTHS PREGNANT WITH HER SECOND CHILD. HER  FIRST WAS BORN SEVEN WEEKS TOO EARLY AFTER A BEATING FROM HER EX-PARTNER FORCED HER INTO A HOSPITAL BED AND CONSEQUENTLY LABOUR. SIX YEARS LATER MARTINE, 29, HAS A NEW RELATIONSHIP AND A NEW BABY ON THE WAY BUT THE ABUSE HAS NOT STOPPED FROM HER EX-PARTNER, WHO CONTINUES TO HARASS HER DAILY.  DESPITE LEAVING THE MAN WHO BEAT HER INTO EARLY LABOUR, MARTINE FEARS HIS CONSTANT HARASSMENT COULD FORCE ANOTHER PREMATURE BIRTH. "HE HAS THREATENED MY LIFE, KILLED ANIMALS IN MY YARD, THREATENS ANY NEW RELATIONSHIP I START TO THE WHERE PARTNERS HAVE LEFT SHE SAYS. MARTINE HAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORDER IN PLACE, BUT SAYS HER EX-PARTNER HAS CHANGED HIS METHODS OF HARASSMENT TO AVOID GETTING CAUGHT. "MY TYRES HAVE BEEN LET DOWN, HIS CAR CONSTANTLY DRIVES PAST MY HOME, AND I KEEP GETTING PRIVATE NUMBERS CALLING MY PHONE. JUST THIS MORNING I HAD A CALL AND I KNOW IT'S HIM," SHE SAYS. "I HAVE HAD TO CHANGE MY PHONE NUMBER SIX TIMES." HAVING ALREADY BEEN THROUGH A PRE-TERM BIRTH AND LIVING WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS, MARTINE'S PREGNANCY IS CLASSIFIED AS BEING HIGH-RISK. HOWEVER, AT SIX MONTHS PEGNANT SHE HAS TO DEFEND HERSELF IN COURT FROM HER EX-PARTNER, WHO MADE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT HER FITNESS TO PARENT THEIR CHILD. "I'M SCARED THE STRESS OF ALL THE COURT CASES COULD TRIGGER ANOTHER PRE-TERM LABOUR," SHE SAID. "HE SAID 'I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL YOU DIE SO I CAN PISS ON YOUR GRAVE'. I KNOW HE WANTS ME OUT OF THE PICTURE ANY WAY POSSIBLE." "HE HAS MADE MY LIFE HELL, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY." A STRING OF WOMEN'S DEATHS CAUSED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN EARLY HAS PROMPTED MORE WOMEN TO SPEAK OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES. SARAH*, 26, FOUGHT BACK TEARS AS SHE DESCRIBED HEARING ABOUT THE RECENT SPATE OF ATTACKS AGAINST WOMEN. "IT COULD HAVE BEEN ME," SHE SAYS, REFERRING TO KARINA LOCK WHO WAS SHOT DEAD AT A MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT ON THE GOLD COAST. LOCK'S WAS ONE OF THREE LIVES LOST TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN A HORROR WEEK FOR QUEENSLAND. SARAH IS PERMANENTLY DISABLED FROM HER ABUSIVE EX-PARTNER AND, LIKE MANY WOMEN, THE VIOLENCE WAS EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY.
184	HUNGARY HAS DETAINED 60 MIGRANTS FOR ILLEGALLY CROSSING THE SERBIAN BORDER FENCE AS IT IMPOSED TOUGH NEW RULES TO SECURE ITS SOUTHERN FRONTIER AND STOP THE FLOW OF REFUGEES. AUTHORITIES ERECTED A RAZOR-WIRE FENCE OVERNIGHT AT A RAILWAY TRACK USED BY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES TO CROSS INTO HUNGARY FROM NEIGHBOURING SERBIA, A NON-EU NATION. HUNGARY ALSO DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN TWO SOUTHERN COUNTIES NEAR THE BORDER BECAUSE OF THE MIGRATION CRISIS. THE HUNGARIAN ARMY HAS ALREADY BEEN DEPLOYED IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY? BUT REINFORCEMENTS MAY BE SENT TO THE CRISIS AREAS. ON TUESDAY, POLICE DETAINED THE 60 MIGRANTS FOR BREACHING THE RAZOR-WIRE FENCE, THE GOVERNMENT SAID. THE SPOTS WHERE THE FENCE WAS DAMAGED WERE BEING REPAIRED. POLICE ALSO SAID 9,380 MIGRANTS WERE CAUGHT CROSSING FROM SERBIA ON MONDAY, THE HIGHEST DAILY FIGURE THIS YEAR. THE GOVERNMENT HAS VOWED TO BUILD A 3.5M-HIGH FENCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE 108 MILES OF HUNGARYS SOUTHERN BORDER BY OCTOBER. NEW BORDER LAWS AND POWERS TO EXPEL ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO CROSS FROM SERBIA WERE ENACTED AT MIDNIGHT LOCAL TIME, PROMPTING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TO CAMP OUT AT THE BORDER, AS AID WORKERS BROUGHT TENTS, FOOD AND WATER. SKYS ALEX ROSSI, ON THE SERBIAN SIDE OF THE BORDER, MET A FAMILY WHO SAID THEIR BABY WAS BORN FOUR DAYS AGO IN GREECE AS THEY MADE THE JOURNEY FROM SYRIA TO EUROPE. THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR ITS TREATMENT OF THE REFUGEES. BUT OFFICIALS ARE ADAMANT THE COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT ITSELF, WHILE ALSO CLAIMING IT IS ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF EUROPES BORDERS. THE UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE AGENCY, THE UNHCR, SAID IT DISPUTES HUNGARYS DESIGNATION OF SERBIAAS A SAFE THIRD COUNTRY, AND ADVISED MIGRANTS AGAINST RETURNING TO SERBIA. MORE THAN 190,000 REFUGEES HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS ENTERING HUNGARY THIS YEAR, MANY OF THEM FLEEING CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA. MOST OF THE REFUGEES ARE TRYING TO REACH THE RICHER COUNTRIES OF NORTHERN AND WESTERN EUROPE, PARTICULARLY GERMANY. HUNGARY SAYS REFUGEES ARE STILL ABLE TO CLAIM ASYLUM AT OFFICIAL BORDER CROSSINGS, BUT IF THEY HAVE ENTERED FROM SERBIA THEY FACE AUTOMATIC EXPULSION WITHIN EIGHT DAYS. ANY REFUGEE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE COUNTRY UNOFFICIALLY FACES A 12 MONTH TO THREE-YEAR PRISON TERM. AT THE OFFICIAL BORDER CROSSING, AROUND A MILE FROM THE NOW-CLOSED UNOFFICIAL CROSSING POINT, THE HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES LAUNCHED AN UNEXPECTED MASS TRANSIT OPERATION. REFUGEES STILL INSIDE SERBIA WERE ALLOWED TO FORM THEMSELVES INTO LINES AND ENTER THE CUSTOMS AREA, TO BE LOADED ONTO BUSES. THEY WERE THEN DRIVEN A SHORT DISTANCE TO TRAINS WAITING TO TAKE THEM TO AUSTRIA. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES HAVE MADE THE JOURNEY TO EUROPE THIS YEAR, THE VAST MAJORITY HEADING TO GERMANY, AS THEY FLEE CONFLICT AND POVERTY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. IN BRUSSELS, MINISTERS FROM THE 28-NATION BLOC HAVE AGREED TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 40,000 PEOPLE SEEKING REFUGE IN OVERWHELMED ITALY AND GREECE. THE LEADERS ARE HOPEFUL OF REACHING EVENTUAL AGREEMENT ON WHICH EUROPEAN NATIONS WOULD TAKE 120,000 MORE. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WANTS 22 EU MEMBER STATES TO SIGN UP TO A QUOTA POLICY BUT SEVERAL NATIONS OPPOSE SUCH A MOVE, INCLUDING POLAND, SLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY. MINISTERS WILL MEET AGAIN NEXT MONTH TO WORK OUT HOW MANY REFUGEES EACH NATION WILL TAKE IN. BUT THE FAILURE TO REACH A CONSENSUS ON THE 120,000 HAS DRAWN CRITICISM, INCLUDING FROM SOME AID AGENCIES. THE GERMAN VICE CHANCELLOR SIGMAR GABRIEL SAID EUROPE MADE A FOOL OF ITSELF AGAIN YESTERDAY. MR GABRIEL RAISED THEPROJECTION ON THE NUMBER OF NEWCOMERS GERMANY EXPECTS TO SHELTER THIS YEAR FROM 800,000 TO 1 MILLION. VIDEO FOR SKY NEWS, 2015, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

186	I HAD NOT HEARD OF IMRE KERTSZ UNTIL TODAY, BUT I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN JEWISH HISTORY SINCE THE 1970'S, HOLOCAUST HISTORY SINCE THE 80'S, AND HUNGARIAN HISTORY SINCE THE LATE 90'S. ALSO, I AM VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN EUROPE NOW. HIS VOICE IS UNEXPECTED ON THE ANTI-MIGRATION SIDE. PERHAPS IT IS DRIVEN ENTIRE BY HIS ETHNIC JEWISHNESS, BUT IT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE DRAWN FROM A BROAD LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL MIND, AND A LONG HISTORY OF OBSERVING CENTRAL EUROPEAN BEHAVIOR. THERE WAS A LINKED WEEKLY STANDARD ARTICLE TODAY WHICH INTRODUCED ME TO KERTSZ. I DON'T KNOW WHAT EUROPE SHOULD DO ABOUT AN INVASION WHICH IS ABOUT 25% PATHETIC REFUGEES AND 75% OPPORTUNISTS WITH LARGELY ECONOMIC MOTIVES - OR WORSE. I DON'T BLAME THE YOUNG MEN FROM AFRICA AND ASIA FOR THEIR DESIRE TO MOVE TO A PLACE WHERE THEY MIGHT MAKE A DECENT LIVING, AS OPPOSED TO THE OPPRESSIVE COUNTRIES THEY COME FROM. BUT NEITHER DO I FEEL SORRY FOR THAT GROUP. HOW DO THEY RESCUE THE ONE AND TURN BACK THE OTHER? ESPECIALLY AS THE 25% IS A DEFEATED, FRIGHTENED, KICKED-DOG GROUP WHILE THE OTHER IS A DEFIANT, VIOLENT SECTOR PREPARED TO PUNISH ANYONE IN THEIR PATH? AND ARE ALREADY COMPLAINING THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING TREATED RIGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR MUSLIM SENSIBILITIES? IF YOU WANT A NICE MULTICULTI GROUP WITH DECENT FAMILIES MOVING IN TO HELP TEACH YOUR CHILDREN THAT "SEE? THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE ALL OVER. LET'S HAVE THEM FOR BARBECUE - OH! OR SOMETHING - NEXT SATURDAY," THEN THESE ARE NOT THE DROIDS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. A SERBIAN FRIEND, A REFUGEE WHO WORKS AT MY HOSPITAL SAID LAST WEEK. "I HATE, HATE MILOEVI. HE WOULD KILL HIS MOTHER. BUT THIS IS WHAT HE SAID." A STORY FROM 1993. OUR FAMILY SPONSORED A HAITIAN CHILD FROM ABOUT 1986-96. IN 1991, HAITIANS STARTED COMING ACROSS TO FLORIDA IN MAKESHIFT BOATS IN INCREASING NUMBERS. BUSH 41 HAD THEM STEERED TO GUANTANAMO OR BACK TO HAITI, WHILE WE DECIDED WHAT TO DO WITH A GROUP WHICH WAS PART POLITICAL, PART ECONOMIC REFUGEE. BILL CLINTON MADE IT A CAMPAIGN ISSUE, THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE SO CRUEL AS TO NOT RESCUE SUCH PEOPLE, PROMISING THE US WOULD HELP SUCH SUFFERERS UNDER A CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. IN EARLY 1993 THE NUMBERS OF HAITIANS IN RIDICULOUSLY RICKETY BOATS SUDDENLY INCREASED IN THE ATLANTIC. WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY RESCUE THEM IN A WELCOMING CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. WE EVENTUALLY, QUIETLY, WITHOUT A LOT OF REPORTING, SENT THEM BACK. EXCEPT FOR THOSE WHO HAD ALREADY DROWNED TRYING TO GET HERE, CONFIDENT THAT THE CALCULATED RISK WAS NOW WORTH IT. THEIR NUMBER INCLUDED THE FATHER OF OUR SPONSORED CHILD. I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR TRYING. WHY WOULDN'T HE BELIEVE WHAT AN AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SAID? FALSE KINDNESS KILLS, AND IT KILLS THE POOREST AND MOST VULNERABLE. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT EUROPE SHOULD DO, BUT I DON'T SEE HOW IT CAN ABSORB THE MILLIONS WHO WILL WANT TO COME. THEY WANT TO COME TO GERMANY, AND SWEDEN, AND FRANCE. THEY ARE TRYING TO BYPASS A DOZEN WARLESS BUT POORER NATIONS. YET WESTERN EUROPE, FOR ALL ITS RHETORIC, IS ULTIMATELY ABLE TO SLOW THE NUMBERS INTO THEIR COUNTRIES TO A MANAGEABLE LEVEL. AS IN THE YEARS 640-1683, IT WILL BE ITALY, GREECE, BULGARIA, SERBIA, CROATIA, MACEDONIA, ROMANIA, HUNGARY WHO PAY THE PRICE.
187	MORE PUBLIC SERVICE NEWS FINANCE DEPARTMENT SECRETARY JANE HALTON SAYS IT IS TIME TO SLASH THE AMOUNT OF DUPLICATED INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES MUST GATHER FOR PERFORMANCE REPORTING. MS HALTON SAID RED TAPE NEEDED TO BE CURTAILED BY PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO OFTEN CREATED IT THEMSELVES, SEEMINGLY OUT OF THIN AIR. SHE SAID ONE PUBLIC SERVANT SHE KNEW THOUGHT HE NEEDED THREE QUOTES BEFORE SPENDING $100 ON A CREDIT CARD WHEN IN FACT HE DID NOT. "SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE HAS DECIDED THAT'S WHAT THE RULES ARE AND THAT HAS BECOME LOCAL MYTH," MS HALTON SAID. "IT'S NOT DONE FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN GOOD INTENTIONS." SPEAKING TO AN AUDIENCE OF PUBLIC SERVANTS AT A DINNER TO MARK THE START OF THE FIRST INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ACT CONFERENCE, SHE SAID INFORMATION PROVIDED IN ANNUAL REPORTS - NOW MUCH THICKER THAN THEY WERE 30 YEARS AGO - "DID NOT ADD TO THE SUM OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE". MS HALTON ALSO REVEALED AS HEALTH DEPARTMENT SECRETARY SHE "HAD WORDS" WITH JOE HOCKEY, WHEN HE WAS SHADOW TREASURER, ABOUT FACTUALLY INCORRECT CLAIMS HE MADE REGARDING ALLEGED FEDERAL-STATE DUPLICATION. IN 2012 HE WAS OFTEN QUOTED AS SAYING "THERE'S A DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN CANBERRA WITH OVER 6000 EMPLOYEES - NOT ONE OF THEM IS A DOCTOR OR NOT ONE OF THEM IS A NURSE TREATING A PATIENT". IN FACT THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC SERVANTS WAS NOT AS HIGH AS 6000 AND A NUMBER OF THEM WERE DOCTORS. "I THINK IT WAS A RHETORICAL FLOURISH," MS HALTON SAID. SHE BALANCED THIS BY SAYING IT WAS FAIR TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE BECAUSE EXPERIENCE HAD SHOWN IT WAS EASY FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE WORKFORCE TO ESCALATE. TREASURY SECRETARY JOHN FRASER, BROUGHT FROM GLOBAL ASSET MANAGER UBS EIGHT MONTHS AGO, SAID THE "RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY" IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE "STILL GETS YOU DOWN AT TIMES" BUT HE FELT AS THOUGH PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE. HE CREDITED PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONER JOHN LLOYD WITH MAKING IT EASIER TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RECRUIT STAFF. AT A TIME WHEN THE PUBLIC SERVICE WILL BE LOOKING TO MAKE THE MOST OF TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW IT TO WORK QUICKER, MR FRASER SAID HE WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE AUSTRALIAN BUREAUCRACY TO FIND SOME OF THE OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY USED.
188	PEYTON MANNING'S SUMMER WAS BOTH DAZZLING AND PERPLEXING. PRACTICES CONSISTED OF SPRINT-OUTS, ROLL-OUTS AND BOOTLEGS FROM UNDER CENTER, PLAY-ACTION PASSES FROM THE PISTOL FORMATION AND SCRAMBLES FOR FIRST DOWNS IN DEFIANCE OF HIS 39-YEAR-OLD LEGS. PRESEASON GAMES WERE FILLED WITH EMPTY BACKFIELDS AND SHOTGUN FORMATIONS THAT PRODUCED A PAUCITY OF POINTS AND PLENTY OF ANGST AMONG BRONCOS FANS AND FANTASY FOOTBALL OWNERS ALIKE. WHICH MANNING SHOWS UP SUNDAY IS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE. "THE LAST THREE YEARS HE'S BEEN HERE, THERE WERE (PRESEASON) GAMES WE DIDN'T SCORE POINTS AND WE'D COME OUT AND SCORE 35, 42 POINTS" IN THE OPENER, WIDE RECEIVER DEMARYIUS THOMAS SAID. "SO, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BY DESIGN OR NOT, BUT IT HAPPENS." IF MANNING IS CONCERNED THAT HE DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN AUGUST, HE DIDN'T SHOW IT WEDNESDAY. "HEY, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SUNDAY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM," MANNING SAID. "WE'VE GOT SOME NEW GUYS PLAYING AND WE'VE GOT SOME NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO. I'VE SAID ALL ALONG THE KEY FOR US IS TO IMPROVE THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF A GAME. "BALTIMORE'S AN EXCELLENT DEFENSE. ARE YOU GOING TO DOMINATE ALL FOUR QUARTERS? I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S EVER DONE THAT AGAINST BALTIMORE, BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WIN ENOUGH PLAYS AND BE EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO WIN THE FOOTBALL GAME." RAVENS COACH JOHN HARBAUGH SAID ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES HE'S FACING THIS WEEK AS HE PREPARES FOR THE OPENER WAS FIGURING OUT HOW BRONCOS COACH GARY KUBIAK, HIS FORMER OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WAS ADAPTING HIS SCHEME TO FIT MANNING'S SKILLS. "THE TEAMS THAT PLAY HIM IN WEEK 3 AND 4 AND 5 AND 6 AND DOWN THE ROAD WILL HAVE A BETTER FEEL FOR THAT THAN WE WILL," HARBAUGH SAID. "I'M SURE THAT THEY DIDN'T SHOW IN THE PRESEASON EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE PLANNING ON DOING." THE BRONCOS SHOWED ALMOST NOTHING IN THE PRESEASON, IN PART BECAUSE MANNING NEVER HAD PRO BOWL RECEIVERS THOMAS AND EMMANUEL SANDERS TOGETHER WITH HIM ON THE FIELD. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO USE TRAINING CAMP TO GET A FEEL FOR THE FUTURE. GENERAL MANAGER JOHN ELWAY SAID HE LIKED WHAT HE SAW IN BROCK OSWEILER, WHO'S ENTERING HIS FOURTH SEASON AS MANNING'S BACKUP. HE ALSO LIKED ROOKIE TREVOR SIEMIAN, SO MUCH SO THAT HE HAD TO KEEP THE FORMER NORTHWESTERN QB ON THE 53-MAN ROSTER RATHER THAN RISK TRYING TO SLIP HIM THROUGH TO THE PRACTICE SQUAD. MANNING MADE CAMEOS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD EXHIBITION GAMES AND DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN NINE FULL POSSESSIONS. HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PLAYED MORE AND BETTER BUT WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS PREPARATION FOR HIS 18TH NFL SEASON. HARBAUGH MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO EXPECT SUNDAY, BUT HE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF KUBIAK AND HIS TOP LIEUTENANT, RICK DENNISON, LAST YEAR, RAVENS QUARTERBACK JOE FLACCO HAD THE BEST SEASON OF HIS SEVEN-YEAR CAREER. "I'M SURE THAT PEYTON IS HAVING A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM," FLACCO SAID. "... THEY JUST HELPED ME PLAY FAST, PLAY WITH A QUIET MIND, BE CONFIDENT AND MAKE QUICK DECISIONS. I THINK THAT OUR LINE PLAYED REALLY WELL LAST YEAR UNDER THEIR PROTECTION SCHEME AND I THINK THAT HELPED OUT A TON." THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR MANNING, WHO HAS FOUR NEW O-LINEMEN, INCLUDING TWO NOVICES IN LEFT TACKLE TY SAMBRAILO AND CENTER MATT PARADIS. RAVENS RUNNING BACK JUSTIN FORSETT WENT FROM JOURNEYMAN TO PRO BOWLER IN KUBIAK'S ZONE BLOCKING SCHEME LAST YEAR, AND HARBAUGH SAID DENVER PRO BOWLER C.J. ANDERSON SHOULD BE IN FOR A SIMILARLY SPECTACULAR SEASON. "HE'S A DOWNHILL, ONE-CUT, VERY PHYSICAL GUY," HARBAUGH SAID. "DIFFERENT KINDS OF BACKS ARE GOOD IN THIS SCHEME, BUT THEY'VE GOT TWO OF THEM. RONNIE HILLMAN DOES IT DIFFERENTLY THAN C.J. DOES IT. I THINK THEY'VE GOT TWO GUYS WITH DIFFERENT STYLES THAT RUN THE SCHEME VERY WELL." NOTES: PLAYERS VOTED MANNING, DE DEMARCUS WARE AND S DAVID BRUTON JR. AS TEAM CAPTAINS. ...

BARTKOWSKI IS THE SECOND TANEV IN THE MAKING, WITH GREAT MOBILITY AND PUCK-MOVING SKILLS. COMING TO VANCOUVER FROM AN ILL-SPOKEN BOSTON LOCKER ROOM, BARTKOWSKI IS LOOKING TO START ALL OVER AGAIN, AFTER SIGNING A NEW ONE-YEAR, $1.75M DEAL. ONE REASON FOR EARLY OPTIMISM FOR THIS SIGNING IS HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE CANUCKS PRESEASON GAMES. AFTER A COUPLE RUSTY SHIFTS, BARTKOWSKI TURNED ON HIS GAME AND SHOWED US WHY WE HAD PAID TO LAND HIM VIA FREE AGENCY. HIS TRANSITION PLAY WAS SPECTACULAR, AND HIS UP-ICE VISION MADE THE FORWARDS LIVES EASIER GOING UP THE ICE.

BARTKOWSKI IS COMING OFF A SEASON WITH JUST FOUR ASSISTS IN 47 GAMES, A DECLINE FROM HIS PRODUCTION FROM TWO YEARS AGO WHEN HE PLAYED A TOP-4 ROLE WITH THE BRUINS. HOWEVER, AS A DEFENSEMAN, HIS YEAR WILL NOT BE GAUGED JUST BASED ON HIS POINT TOTALS. HE WILL BE JUDGED ON HOW WELL HE PLAYS OUT JIM BENNINGS PURPOSE IN SIGNING HIM, TO BE A MOBILE DEFENSEMAN WHO HAS THE WHEELS TO PROVIDE SOME PLAYMAKING.

IF BARTKOWSKI WANTS TO STAY IN VANCOUVER, HE WILL NEED TO CARRY SBISA AND BAIL HIM OUT ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. I AM MORE THAN COMFORTABLE IN HAVING BARTKOWSKI AT $1.75M A YEAR AS MY 3RD PAIRING DEFENDER, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE SBISA BETTER.

190	BRITISH SCIENTISTSMAKE APPLICATION TO THE GOVERNMENTS FERTILITY WATCHDOG WANT TO USE TECHNIQUE TO UNDERSTAND CAUSES OF REPEAT MISCARRIAGES INSIST THE GENETICALLY MODIFIED EMBYROS WOULD BE DESTROYED AFTER PROJECT CRITICS CALL FOR A BAN ON THE CREATION OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED BABIES IVF EMBRYOS COULD BE GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BRITISH HISTORY IF A UNIQUE APPLICATION FROM SCIENTISTS IS ALLOWED. THE GENETICISTS INVOLVED SAY THEY HOPE TO USE THE TECHNIQUE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES SOME WOMEN TO SUFFER REPEATED MISCARRIAGES, USING A GENE MANIPULATION TECHNIQUE CALLED CRISPR/CAS9. IN APRIL THIS YEAR, CHINESE SCIENTISTS BECAME THE FIRST TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY TO GENETICALLY MODIFY SPARE HUMAN IVF EMBRYOS, CAMPAIGNERS WARNED OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE THAT COULD LEAD TO DESIGNER BABIES. THE GENETICISTS INVOLVED SAY THEY HOPE TO USE THE TECHNIQUE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES SOME WOMEN TO SUFFER REPEATED MISCARRIAGES. PICTURED: EMBRYO SELECTION FOR IVF THE TEAM FROM SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY IN GUANGZHOU, SOUTH CHINA, WERE AIMING TO MODIFY THE GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR BETA THALASSAEMIA - A POTENTIALLY FATAL INHERITED BLOOD DISORDER. EDITING GENETIC CODES TO REMOVE INHERITED DISEASE HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN TO WORK ON MICE. HOWEVER MOST GENETICISTS BELIEVE THE PROCEDURE IS NOT READY TO BE CARRIED OUT ON HUMAN EMBRYOS. THE UNNAMED BRITISH SCIENTISTS APPLICATION TO THE GOVERNMENTS FERTILITY WATCHDOG SEEKS PERMISSION TO UNDERTAKE SIMILAR WORK, BUT THIS TIME FOCUSING ON WHY SOME WOMEN SUFFER REPEATED MISCARRIAGES. THE RESEARCH TEAM HAVE SAID THAT IF THEIR APPLICATION IS GRANTED, THE GENETICALLY MODIFIED EMBYROS WOULD BE DESTROYED AFTER THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED. THEY ALSO MAINTAIN THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT THE EMBYROS COULD SURIVE. THE CHINESE SCIENTISTS USED AN ADVANCED CUT AND PASTE TECHNIQUE INVOLVING THE INJECTION OF ENZYMES, ATTEMPTING TO EDIT THE DNA IN 86 NON-VIABLE HUMAN EMBRYOS FROM LOCAL FERTILITY CLINICS. THE RESEARCH TEAM HAVE SAID THAT IF THEIR APPLICATION IS GRANTED, THE GENETICALLY MODIFIED EMBYROS WOULD BE DESTROYED AFTER THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED NONVIABLE EMBRYOS ARE THOSE WHICH CANNOT RESULT IN A LIVE BIRTH. THE GENES ONLY CHANGED IN 28 CASES, BUT EVEN AMONG THOSE THERE WERE NUMEROUS MUTATIONS WHICH WERE NOT INTENDED BY THE SCIENTISTS. MANY EXPERTS SAID THE ULTIMATE FAILURE OF THE PROCEDURE UNDERLINES THE CASE FOR CAUTION WITH THE TECHNIQUE. DR DAVID KING, FROM WATCHDOG HUMAN GENETICS ALERT, SAID: THIS NEWS EMPHASISES THE NEED FOR AN IMMEDIATE GLOBAL BAN ON THE CREATION OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED DESIGNER BABIES. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE AVOID A EUGENIC FUTURE. IF CHINA DOES NOT WANT TO GET THE REPUTATION OF BEING THE WILD WEST OF THE NEW EUGENICS IT MUST JOIN THE MANY COUNTRIES - INCLUDING THE UK - WHICH WOULD BAN SUCH RESEARCH. LEAD SCIENTIST DR JUNJIU HUANG ADMITTED THE EXPERIMENT, PUBLISHED BY JOURNAL PROTEIN AND CELL, HAD FAILED. HE TOLD NATURE NEWS: IF YOU WANT TO DO IT IN NORMAL EMBRYOS, YOU NEED TO BE CLOSE TO 100 PER CENT. THATS WHY WE STOPPED. ITS TOO IMMATURE. HE ADDED THE REPORT WAS REJECTED BY LEADING JOURNALS SCIENCE AND NATURE. BOTH ORGANISATIONS LAST NIGHT REFUSED TO CONFIRM OR DENY THE CLAIM. HE SAID: WE WANTED TO SHOW OUR DATA TO THE WORLD SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WITH THIS MODEL, RATHER THAN JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITHOUT DATA. DR GEORGE DALEY, A STEM CELL BIOLOGIST AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, SAID THE EXPERIMENT POSES A CAUTIONARY TALE. THE US GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY ENFORCING A MORATORIUM ON FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC.
191	NICEGIRLSTV IS ALL ABOUT AMAZING WOMEN SO WE ARE HAPPY TO BRING YOU OUR WOMEN OF THE WEEK. EACH WEEK WE WILL GET TOGETHER AND SHARE OUR FAVORITE TV WOMEN WITH YOU. THERE ARE SO MANY TALENTED WOMEN ON TV THAT WE WANTED TO RECOGNIZE FOR THEIR BRILLIANCE AND BEAUTY. MOST BADASS: KIKI SUKEZANE FROM HEROES REBORN CHARACTER NAME: MIKO OTOMO NOMINATED BY LEE ANN, THE FIGHT SEQUENCES SHE PERFORMED ALBEIT AS AN AVATAR IN THAT VIDEO GAME WERE PRETTY SPECTACULAR. HONORABLE MENTION: MAGDA APANOWICZ FROM CONTINUUM CHARACTER NAME: EMILY NOMINATED BY LEE ANN, DESPITE BEING KIDNAPPED, SHE FOUGHT HER CAPTORS LIKE CRAZY AND THEN USED HER SMARTS TO GET FREE AND BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF THE GUYS WHO TOOK HER. THOSE FIGHT SCENES WERE JUST WOW; AND THEN, REALIZING THAT DESPITE HOW MUCH SHE CARES ABOUT BOYFRIEND ALEC (AND THE REVELATION THAT SHE IS NOT THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILD THIS IS A COMPLICATED STORYLINE IF YOU DONT WATCH THE SHOW), AND THAT SHE POSES A RISK FOR ALECS MISSION (ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM), THAT SHE NEEDS TO LEAVE. GREAT PERFORMANCE NOT ONLY IN THE FIGHT SCENES BUT ALSO PUTTING HER EMOTIONS ON THE LINE. MOTHER OF THE YEAR IS A THREE WAY TIE FOR THREE VERY DIFFERENT REASONS: JULIE BOWEN FROM MODERN FAMILY CHARACTER NAME: CLAIRE DUNPHY NOMINATED BY LISA, CLAIRE WAS TRYING TO CHEER HALEY UP AFTER ANDY (THE GUY SHE REALIZED SHE LOVED) PROPOSED TO SOMEONE ELSE.

193	SOME FARMERS IN HADEJIA, JIGAWA HAVE COMMENDED THE STATE GOVERNMENT OVER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TWO SUGAR FACTORIES BY DANGOTE GROUP AND CRYSTAL SUGAR COMPANY. A CROSS SECTION OF THE FARMERS GAVE THE COMMENDATION IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) IN HADEJIA ON SUNDAY. ALHAJI IDRIS YAU, A COMMERCIAL FARMER, SAID THAT THE EFFORT OF STATE GOVERNMENT IN ENCOURAGING INVESTMENT IN THE SECTOR WAS COMMENDABLE. YAU SAID THE SUGAR FACTORIES WOULD GENERATE EMPLOYMENT AND ENHANCE WEALTH CREATION AMONG RURAL FARMERS. WE COMMEND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUGARCANE PLANTATIONS AND SUGAR FACTORIES IN HADEJIA AND KAUGAMA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS OF THE STATE. THIS IS A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS COMMITMENT TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURING SECTORS, HE SAID. MALAM ABDULLAHI HARUNA, ANOTHER FARMER, SAID THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SUGAR FACTORIES WOULD ENCOURAGE SUGARCANE FARMING IN THE STATE. HARUNA NOTED THAT FARMERS WERE NOT CULTIVATING SUGARCANE DUE TO LACK OF MARKET FOR THE PRODUCE. WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT, FARMERS WHO HITHERTO, ABANDONED THE PLANTATIONS WILL NOW CULTIVATE SUGARCANE, HE SAID. NAN RECALLS THAT THE JIGAWA GOVERNMENT HAD IN THE YEAR 2000 INTRODUCED INDUSTRIAL SUGARCANE FARMING AND ESTABLISHED A SUGAR FACTORY IN HADEJIA. THE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED ABOUT 5, 000 PILOT SUGARCANE PLANTATION IN THE AREA. THE SUGAR FACTORY PROJECT WAS ABANDONED AFTER IT REACHED ABOUT 90 PER CENT COMPLETION STAGE, WHILE THE SUGARCANE PLANTATIONS DESIGNED TO SUPPLY RAW MATERIALS TO THE FACTORY WILTED DUE TO NON COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT. IN ITS DRIVE TO ACTUALIZE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SUGARCANE PRODUCTION PROGRAMME, THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAD IN 2013, SOLD THE ABANDONED SUGAR FACTORY TO CRYSTAL SUGAR COMPANY. THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAD EQUALLY INVITED DANGOTE GROUP TO ESTABLISH ANOTHER SUGAR FACTORY IN KAUGAUMA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF THE STATE. ALSO SPEAKING, ALHAJI MUHAMMAD ABACHA, THE CHAIRMAN, CRYSTAL SUGAR COMPANY, SAID THAT THE FACTORY WOULD PRODUCE REFINED SUGAR, ANIMAL FEEDS AND ETHANOL AS WELL AS GENERATE 150 MEGAWATTS OF ELECTRICITY IN THE STATE. ABACHA TOLD NAN THAT THE FACTORY WOULD ENGAGED ABOUT 30, 000 WORKERS FROM THE STATE. HE NOTED THAT THE COMPANY WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL 30, 000 HECTRES OF SUGARCANE PLANTATION WHEN IT BECOME FULLY OPERATIONAL. ON HIS PART, ALHAJI ALIKO DANGOTE, THE CHAIRMAN DANGOTE GROUP, ANNOUNCED THAT HIS COMPANY WOULD INVEST 250 MILLION US DOLLARS IN THE PROPOSED SUGAR FACTORY IN THE STATE. DANGOTE, WHO STATED THIS DURING A VISIT TO THE STATE RECENTLY SAID THE SUGAR FACTORY WAS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE OPERATION LATER THIS YEAR. HE SAID THAT ABOUT 20,000 HECTARES FARMLANDS WOULD BE DEVELOPED TO PRODUCE SUGARCANE WITH AN ANNUAL PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF MORE THAN 150,000 METRIC TONNES. DANGOTE EXPLAINED THAT SOME 10, 000 FARMERS WOULD BE ENGAGED IN SUGARCANE CULTIVATION, WHILE 13, 000 INDIGENES OF THE STATE WOULD BE EMPLOYED AS CONVENTIONAL FACTORY WORKERS. WE ARE HOPING TO COMMENCE WORK IN THE FACTORY BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, BECAUSE PRODUCTION OF SUGAR IS A SEASONAL BUSINESS AND THE SEASON IS QUITE SHORT, HE SAID. THE BUSINESS MOGUL ADDED THAT THE FACTORY WOULD UTILISE PRODUCTS FROM SUGARCANE TO PRODUCE ETHANOL FOR VEHICLES, FERTILISER AND ANIMAL FEEDS TO BOOST SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. NAN REPORTS, HOWEVER, THAT BOTH THE TWO FACTORIES OWNED BY DANGOTE GROUP AND CRYSTAL SUGAR COMPANY RESPECTIVELY WERE YET TO COMMENCE OPERATION. (NAN)
194	WHEN IT COMES TO FASHION BLOGGERS WHO HAVE MADE IT BIG, KRISTINA BAZAN OF KAYTURE INSTANTLY COMES TO MIND. THE SWISS STYLE POWERHOUSE JET SETS ACROSS THE WORLD WEARING THE MOST INSANELY GORGEOUS OUTFITS, TAKES OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD PICTURES (BELIEVE US, THESE ARE NOT YOU AVERAGE #OOTDS), AND ALSO KNOWS A THING OR TWO ABOUT FILMING A SUPER INFORMATIVE MAKEUP TUTORIAL. BUT THE FASHION-SAVVY BUSINESSWOMAN IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST THAT SHE ALSO LOVES TO WRITE AND IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF PENNING HER FIRST BOOK. WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE INSTA-FAMOUS STAR TO TALK EVERYTHING FROM HER LOVE OF MISS DIOR PERFUME , TO HOW-TO NAIL SELFIES, TO THE TEXTURIZING POWDER THAT GIVES HER HAIR INSTANT BEACHY WAVES. OH, AND BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE VIDEO SHE AND HER BESTIE, DIRECTOR JUSTIN WU , FILMED DURING THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL. ITS AN ODE TO HER FAVE FRAGRANCE! BLOGGING WASNT ALWAYS HER CAREER PLAN: IT WAS A VERY SPONTANEOUS DECISION.I WAS ACTUALLY INHIGHSCHOOL AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT I WAS QUITE BORED AT THE TIME.I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A VERY CREATIVE PERSON, AND I WAS INTERESTED IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS.WHEN I OPENED MY BLOG, I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD LEAD ME TO HAVING A CAREER IN FASHION.IT TURNED OUT THAT MY BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME WAS A GREAT PHOTOGRAPHER AND SAID THAT I HAD A GREAT SENSE OF STYLE AND THAT WE SHOULD SHOOT SOME PICTURES.I WAS ALSO WITH A MODELING AGENCY, AND I WAS ALWAYS IN NEED OF SOME CONTENT FOR MY BOOK.WHEN WE STARTED DOING PICTURES TOGETHER, WE REALIZED THAT THEY LOOKED BEAUTIFUL AND THAT IT MADE PERFECT SENSE TO FIND A SPACE ONLINE WHERE WE COULD POST EVERYTHING. HER STYLE HAS CHANGED SINCE THE START OF THE BLOG. A LOT: MY STYLE HAS EVOLVED PRETTY DRAMATICALLY. WHEN I STARTED, I REMEMBER SAYING THAT I WOULD NEVER WEAR JEANS OR TROUSERS.NOW, IT IS MORE THE OPPOSITE IN THAT I WOULD PREFER TO WEAR PANTS INSTEAD OF A DRESS. I THINK I STARTED BY WEARING OUTFITS THAT WERE PRETTY GIRLY AND EXTREMELY FEMININE; NOW I AM SPORTING MORE OF AN EDGY LOOK AND MORE INTO A MINIMALISTIC AESTHETIC INSTEAD OF DOING COLOR BLOCKING OR PLAYING WITH TOO MANY PRINTS.MY STYLE HAS ALWAYS EVOLVED AROUND THE IDEA OF ELEGANCE AND TIMELESSNESS.I JUST ALWAYS TRY TO LOOK CHIC AND POLISHED, BUT EDGY, EFFORTLESS, AND CASUAL AT THE SAME TIME. SHE TAKES MANY, MANY PICTURES TO GET A GOOD ONE: I WOULD SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT TRICK FOR TAKING AMAZING PICTURES IS DEFINITELY TO FIND GREAT LIGHT, BECAUSE LIGHTING IS 7080% OF THE PICTURE.THEN, JUST TRAIN YOUR POSES; I THINK THAT THE MORE YOU SHOOT, THE MORE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR GOOD ANGLES ARE.YOU JUST NEED TO TRY TO TAKE AS MANY PICTURES AS POSSIBLE AND FIND OUT WHAT LOOKS BEST ON YOU. SHE CANT LIVE WITHOUT COCONUT OIL: I ALWAYS TRAVEL WITH A LITTLE POT OF COCONUT OIL BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO MY SKIN, COCONUT OIL HEALS IT.I THEREFORE USE IT AS A MAKEUP REMOVER, A BODY LOTION, AND A MOISTURIZER, AND I USE IT FOR MY HANDS, MY HAIR, EVERYTHING.THERE IS A CLEANSER BY KORA , MIRANDA KERRS BRAND, THAT I HAVE BEEN USING FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF THAT HAS BEEN AMAZING FOR MY SKIN, WHICH IS QUITE SENSITIVE.THIS IS A CREAM CLEANSER, AND IT IS GOOD.YOU CAN BUY IT ON NETAPORTER.I THINK THAT I HAVE ALREADY FINISHED FIVE TUBES OF IT. I REALLY LOVE IT. I ALSO RECENTLY FELL IN LOVE WITH THE NEW DIOR ADDICT LIPSTICKS . SHE DOUBLE CLEANSES: I OBVIOUSLY WEAR QUITE A LOT OF MAKEUP, AS WE ARE OFTEN SHOOTING AND, AS I TRAVEL SO MUCH, I AM JET-LAGGED MORE OR LESS ALL THE TIME. I THEREFORE NEED TO LOOK FRESH AND BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF ALL MY MAKEUP. I CLEANSE MY FACE TWICE. IN THE EVENING, I FIRST TAKE MY MAKEUP OFF WITH EITHER SOME COCONUT OIL OR A BEAUTY BALM.I WILL THEN CLEANSE IT FOR A SECOND TIME WITH THE KORA CLEANSER THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER.I THEN USUALLY USE A BEAUTY MIST, WHICH IS EITHER ROSEWATER OR A THERMAL WATER SPRAY.AFTER THAT, I WILL USE EITHER A SERUM OR SOME OIL. THEN, I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH A CREAM. IN THE MORNING, I TRY TO KEEP THINGS VERY SIMPLE SO I EITHER JUST USE A BIT OF MY CLEANSER AND SOME DAY CREAM OR TONER OR A MIST IF I THINK THAT I DO NOT NEED TO WASH MY FACE AGAIN. I DEFINITELY TRY TO MOISTURIZE AS MUCH AS I CAN. HER FIRST GROWN-UP BEAUTY MOMENT INVOLVED MISS DIOR PERFUME: I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS CELEBRATING MY 16TH BIRTHDAY, MY MOM BOUGHT ME A BOTTLE OF MISSDIORCHERIE , AND THIS WAS SO IMPORTANT TO ME, BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE A FIRST STEP TOWARDS GROWING INTO A WOMAN.THE PERFUME IS A SYMBOL OF PLAYFULNESS AND FRESHNESS, THAT INVOKES BEING A YOUNG WOMAN WITH SO MUCH AHEAD OF YOU.IT IS A LUXURIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL OBJECT THAT YOU WANT TO CHERISH, AND IT IS A BEAUTIFUL SYMBOL. EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT ELEGANCE AND TIMELESS AESTHETIC AND THIS ASPECT OF BEING FEMININE BUT STILL MODERN, CONFIDENT, POWERFUL, AND STRONG..I THINK OF DIOR IMMEDIATELY. I ALWAYS HAD VERY STRONG CONNECTIONS TO SCENTS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP.EVERY TIME I WENT ON A TRIP WITH MY PARENTS, I HAD A TRADITION TO GO INTO A PHARMACY AND BUY A PERFUME SO THAT WHEN I CAME BACK AND SMELLED THE PERFUME, IT WOULD REMIND ME OF MY HOLIDAYS.I REMEMBER ONE TRIP TO TURKEY WITH MY FAMILY WHEN I BOUGHT THE MONOI PERFUME, AND IT HAD A SCENT THAT REMINDED ME OF THE ISLANDS, THE BEACH, LONG WALKS BY THE WATER, AND SUNSETS.I REMEMBER ALWAYS BEING EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO PERFUMES AND, WHEN I SMELL MISSDIOR CHERIE, IT REALLY REMINDS ME OF WHEN I WAS 16 YEARS OLD AND SO FRESH OUT OF THE OVEN IN A WAY, AND SO FREE AND CARELESS BUT IN A VERY POSITIVE AND CUTE MANNER.AT THE SAME TIME, I WAS EMBRACING THE FACT OF GROWING INTO A WOMAN AND BECOMING MORE CONFIDENT AND AWARE OF MY BODY, AND MYSELF, AND EVERYTHING. ALEXANDRA UTZMANN FOR CHRISTIAN DIOR PARFUMS YOU WOULDNT KNOW IT, BUT SHE BARELY DOES ANYTHING TO HER HAIR: MY HAIR ROUTINE IS VERY EASY, AND I AM LUCKY TO HAVE QUITE FLAT HAIR.AT LEAST IT IS PERFECTLY STRAIGHT, SO I DO NOT NEED TO DO MUCH TO IT.USUALLY, WHEN I GET OUT OF THE SHOWER, I JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT OF MOROCCANOIL ON IT, AND I THEN EITHER LET IT JUST DRY WITH NATURAL AIR, OR BLOWDRY IT AND BRUSH IT LIGHTLY WITH SOME HAIRSTYLING PRODUCTS.I LIKE USING DRY SHAMPOO, AND MY FAVORITE IS BAMONBAMBO, WHICH IS A POWDER THAT IS VERY EASY TO USE AND GIVES YOU A PERFECT TEXTURE. SHE WRITES SONGS IN HER DOWNTIME: WHEN I HAVE SOME DOWNTIME ON MY OWN, I LOVE USING IT TO CREATE THINGS.I LOVE SONGWRITING AND, RECENTLY, I HAVE BEEN SPENDING QUITE A LOT OF TIME ON WRITING MY BOOK.I HAVE ALSO BEEN DRAWING AND WRITING TEXTS.THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF CREATIVE THINGS I LIKE TO DO. THEY REALLY RELAX ME AND MAKE ME FEEL GREAT AND, IN A WAY, I NEED THEM.IF I DO NOT DO THESE THINGS, I WILL FEEL BAD, BECAUSE I NEED TO LET THESE FEELINGS OUT. UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE NOT HAD A LOT OF TIME LATELY TO WATCH MOVIES OR EVEN READ. I USED TO READ A LOT, BUT NOW I JUST PREFER TO WRITE AND CREATE MY OWN THINGS.HOWEVER, I THINK THAT ONCE I HAVE FINISHED WRITING MY BOOK, I WILL START READING SOME OTHER THINGS.THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT BOOKS THAT I WANT TO READ AND DISCOVER. SHE WANTS TO DYE HER HAIR BLACK, BUT PROBABLY WONT: I AM, IN FACT, QUITE SAFE WHEN IT COMES TO BEAUTY.HOWEVER, I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN WEARING A LOT OF WIGS, WHICH IS REALLY FUN, BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO DYE MY HAIR BLACK.THAT WOULD BE SUCH A HUGE CHANGE.I THINK THAT PEOPLE PERCEIVE ME IN A CERTAIN WAY, AND A BLACK WIG MAKES A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SIDE OF MY PERSONALITY COME OUT.I THEREFORE DECIDED TO BUY ONE AND SEE HOW PEOPLE WOULD REACT, OR IF I EVEN FELT DIFFERENTLY WEARING IT.I STARTED BY WEARING IT TO RESTAURANTS, COFFEE SHOPS, AND PARTIES AND JUST TOTALLY EMBRACED MYSELF SORT OF BECOMING A NEW PERSON.IT MAKES ME FEEL THAT I REALLY WANT TO DO IT ONE DAY.IT MIGHT HAPPEN WHO KNOWS? SHE USED TO BE INTO EMO BOY BANDS: I REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS A DRAMATIC CRISIS PERIOD WHERE I WAS DEPRESSED AND REALLY INTO A PARTICULAR BOY BAND, WHEN I WAS ABOUT 15.THEY WERE LIKE EMO AND WERE VERY DARK AND GOTHIC, AND I WAS REALLY INTO THAT. I REMEMBER HOW I FOUGHT WITH MY PARENTS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND WOULD CRY ALL THE TIME.I ALSO ARGUED WITH MY TEACHERS.HOWEVER, IT WAS AN IMPORTANT PERIOD FOR ME TO GO THROUGH.I WOULD THEREFORE JUST TELL MY 15-YEAR-OLD SELF TO LIVE HER EXPERIENCES AND MAKE HER MISTAKES, AND THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT IN THE END.

196	IF YOU COULD CHOOSE WHAT OR WHO TO SPEND YOUR NEXT LIFE AS, WHAT WOULD YOUR CHOICE BE? WHY? IF YOU WOULDPREFER TO LEAVE IT UP TO SOME OTHER POWER TO DECIDE,WHY? TANYA: THIS ONE IS SOOOOOO...EASY!!! IN MY NEXT LIFE I WANT TO BE A BLACK DIVA SOUL SINGER. YOU SEE, I KNOW I HAVE AN INNER ARETHA; WHEN THE MUSIC BEGINS I FEEL HER SWELLING WITHIN ME JUST BURSTING TO BE SET FREE...MY BODY IS GYRATING, I AM FEELING THE SPIRIT WITH EVERY FIBRE OF MY BEING.THE RUB IS, I OPEN MY MOUTH AND THERE IS A PROFOUNDLY SAD DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT I AM SURE IS SURGING THROUGH MY BODY AND WHAT I HEAR EMANATING FROM MY VOCAL CHORDS. SOMETHING ALWAYS GOES TERRIBLY WRONG AS THE SOUND RISES OUT OF MY BODY.IF ONLY IT SOUNDED THE WAY IT FEELS I WOULD BE OVERCOME WITH JOY! SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. HANDS DOWN, NEXT LIFE I CHOOSE TO BE A SOUL SISTER! DAVE W: I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THIS TOPIC FOR THE LAST WEEK AND I CAN'T ESCAPE THE FIRST ANSWER THAT CAME TO ME: IF I COULD CHOOSE WHO I WOULD BE IN MY NEXT LIFE, I WOULD CHOOSE TO BE MYSELF. BUT A HIGHER-EVOLVED RENDITION OF MYSELF. A PERSON WHO, AS A YOUTH, WOULD NOT BE AS FEARFUL OF HIS FATHER, WHO WOULD STAND UP FOR HIMSELF TO BULLIES (BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND FOR OTHERS), WHO WOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THOUGHT, WHO WOULDN'T BE AFRAID OF BEING KNOWN AS "SMART", WHO WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT APPLYING ONESELF IN ATHLETICS IS GOING TO CAUSE PAIN BUT THAT THE PAIN IS TEMPORARY AND THE BENEFITS LONG-LASTING, WHO WOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF ASKING GIRLS OUT AND PUTTING HIS HEART ON THE LINE AND WHO WOULD GO AWAY TO COLLEGE. FAR, FAR AWAY. JAIME: AS I SLIPPED ON MY THREADBARE, BUT FAVORITE JEANS TODAY, THE ONES WHERE THE BELT LOOPS HAVE ALMOST BEEN COMPLETELY TORN OFF THE PANTS THEMSELVES, I REALIZED, THAT'S IT! I WANT TO COME BACK AS A WELL-WORN AND BELOVED PAIR OF BLUE JEANS. IF YOU PUT OUT OF YOUR MIND FOR A MOMENT, THE FACT THAT YOUR OWNER'S CROTCH AND BEHIND WILL RUB UP AGAINST YOU FOR HOURS AT A TIME, AND POSSIBLY FOR YEARS ON END, I HOPE I CAN HELP YOU COME TO UNDERSTAND THE UNCONDITIONAL BOND THAT FORMS BETWEEN A PERSON AND THEIR FAVORITE PAIR OF JEANS. AS THE PERFECT PAIR OF DENIM, I WOULD BE LOVED FROM THE MOMENT I WAS TRIED ON IN THE FITTING ROOM TO THE DAY I WOULD SORROWFULLY BE DONATED TO GOODWILL. ONLY AS A PAIR OF JEANS WOULD I BE LOVED MORE AND MORE WITH EACH PASSING DAY AND WASH. EACH ITERATION IN MY LIFE CYCLE WOULD BRING MY OWNERNEW-FOUNDHAPPINESS, CONFIDENCE, AND COMFORT. AS MY TEXTURE AND STRUCTURE CHANGE OVER TIME, PERHAPS A TEAR HERE OR THERE, OR A BIT OF FADING, I COULD BE REINCARNATED AGAIN AND AGAIN. I WOULD BE APPRECIATED FOR THE FAMILIARITY I OFFER, AND YET THE NEWNESS THAT COMES WITH MY EVER-CHANGING APPEARANCE AND FIT. WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR US TO PART, IT WOULD BE WITH SADNESS, BUT ALSO WITH THE HOPE THAT I WOULD OFFER MY NEXT OWNER THE SAME JOY AND SATISFACTION EXPERIENCED DURING OUR TIME TOGETHER. OKAY, THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A STRETCH, BUT IT WAS FUN TO THINK ABOUT. STEVE: I LIKE KRISTINE'S APPROACH TO THIS THEME, SO HERE'S MY ANSWER-- IN THIS MOMENT: I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND AN INCARNATION AS A CHERRY TREE. EACH YEARI'D SPEND A SEASON COVERED IN BEAUTIFUL BLOSSOMS, AND THEN I'D LET GO OF ALL OF THE PETALS IN BREEZY PINK FLURRIES. I'D MAKE DELICIOUS, JUICY CHERRIES FOR LOVERS TO FEED EACH OTHER AND FOR PARENTS TO BAKE INTO PIES. AND THEN I'D GET TO JUST HANG OUT FOR A WHILE, UNDER THE RADAR, MAYBE A FEW BIRDS NESTING IN MY BRANCHES NOW AND THEN. AND DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, YEAR AFTER YEAR, UNTIL IT'S TIME FOR MY NEXT LIFE. KRISTINE: IN THIS MOMENT THIS IS MY ANSWER--- A CLOUD EVER CHANGING LIGHT REFLECTING FASTLYMOVED HANGING STILL LIGHT AND FLUFFY DARK ANDMENACING HERE THEN GONE
197	ONTARIO DOCTORS WARN THAT PATIENTS WILL HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CUTTING THEIR FEES. THE GOVERNMENT IS CHOPPING FEES BY 1.3 PER CENT STARTING NEXT WEEK TO KEEP THE PROFESSION WITHIN AN ALLOTTED $11.6-BILLION BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. DR. MICHAEL TOTH, PRESIDENT OF THE ONTARIO MEDICAL ASSOCIATION , SAYS THE PROFESSION IS FRUSTRATED AND SOME MEMBERS ARE TALKING ABOUT LEAVING THE PROVINCE OR RETIRING EARLY. "IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PATIENTS ULTIMATELY," HE WARNED, NOTING THAT SOME PHYSICIANS WILL BE FORCED TO LAY OFF STAFF AND CUT OFFICE BUDGETS. PHYSICIANS ARE VENTING THEIR ANGER ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ON TWITTER , HARDLINERS ARE THREATENING JOB ACTION SUCH AS A WORK-TO-RULE CAMPAIGN, HOUR CUTBACKS AND CANCELLATION OF FLU-SHOT CLINICS. TOTH SAID THE OMA, WHICH REPRESENTS 28,000 MEMBERS, WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH GOVERNMENT AND IS CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION. HEALTH MINISTER ERIC HOSKINS SAID HE WANTS TO REASSURE ONTARIANS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERVICE CUTS. "MY CONCERN IS THAT A PERCEPTION IS BEING PROPAGATED THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE CHALLENGING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE FACTS SIMPLY DON'T BEAR THIS OUT," HE SAID. ONTARIO DOCTORS ARE AMONG THE BEST PAID IN CANADA WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF ABOUT $350,000, AN AMOUNT THAT HAS GROWN BY 60 PER CENT OVER THAT LAST DECADE, HOSKINS SAID. FROM THAT, PHYSICIANS PAY OVERHEAD COSTS, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE WAGES AND OFFICE RENT, AN AMOUNT WIDELY QUOTED AS ABOUT 30 PER CENT. HOSKINS SAID PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED OVER WHAT IS A DISPUTE OVER REMUNERATION: "I HAVE RECEIVED ASSURANCE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE OMA THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE ACTION THAT WILL IMPACT THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY PROVIDE OR PATIENT SAFETY. I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD." THE RIFT DATES BACK TO A PAYMENT SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT UNILATERALLY IMPOSED LAST JANUARY AFTER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OMA ENDED IN AN IMPASSE. IT INCLUDED A 2.65 PER CENT FEE CUT AND A CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IF DOCTORS' OHIP BILLINGS WERE TAKING DOCTORS OVER THEIR $11.6-ALLOTMENT. THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENT MODEL ALLOWS DOCTORS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPENSATION. IF THEY SEE MORE PATIENTS AND PERFORM MORE PROCEDURES, THEY CAN BILL THE PUBLIC INSURANCE PLAN FOR MORE MONEY. THE PAYMENT SCHEME ALSO INCLUDES INCREASES OF 1.25 PER CENT IN THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES BUDGET FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE ANNUAL INCREASES ARE INTENDED TO MEET A RISE IN DEMAND FROM A GROWING AND AGING POPULATION AND THE ADDITION OF 700 NEW DOCTORS. BUT THE OMA CONTENDS INCREASES OF 2.7 PER CENT ARE NEEDED IN EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND GROWTH. THE OMA IS LOBBYING MPPS, HOLDING TOWN HALL MEETINGS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE PROVINCE AND STAGING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH MEMBERS NEXT WEEK. TOTH ARGUED THERE IS A "POWER IMBALANCE" WITH GOVERNMENT AND CALLED FOR A NEUTRAL THIRD-PARTY TO WEIGH IN WITH A BINDING DECISION: "WE ARE LOOKING TO RESOLVE THIS ... WE THINK THE WAY TO DO THIS IS MEDIATION-ARBITRATION."

200	MY OWN NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING BLOG POST/ARTICLE: "EASIER" IS THE WORD SHE IS CONTEMPLATING HERE. DOES LOSING A CHILD OR A MUCH WANTED PREGNANCY GET EASIER? I AGREE WITH "NO". IT GETS BEARABLE. THAT IS THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE HOW THINGS ARE ALMOST 4 YEARS OUT. THE DEFINITION OF BEARABLE IS: ABLE TO BE ENDURED, TOLERABLE. IT DIDN'T USED TO FEEL BEARABLE. I WOULD SAY THE GRIEF BECAME BEARABLE SOMETIME BETWEEN YEAR 1 AND 2. BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALL ACTIVE GRIEF. THE FIRST 3 MONTHS I WAS UTTERLY LOST AND CONSUMED BY THE LOSS OF MICHAEL AND ALENA - HAPPINESS FELT PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE. AT 3-6 MONTHS I WAS GETTING INTO THE TERRITORY OF WANTING HAPPINESS AGAIN; OF WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD. THE HEAVIEST KIND OF GRIEF WAS BECOMING EXHAUSTING AND I BEGAN FEELING THE NEED TO PARENT MY LOST BABIES THROUGH ACTS. FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR, I WAS ACTIVELY TRYING TO HEAL AND FIND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY. GRIEF AT THIS STAGE WAS CONSUMING, BUT NOT ALL-CONSUMING. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS A "NORMAL" PERSON AT ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME. AT THIS POINT IN MY JOURNEY AS A BEREAVED MOTHER, I WOULD SAY MOST WOULD CONSIDER ME A NORMAL, HAPPY, FUNCTIONING MOTHER/WIFE/WOMAN ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. MEANING, I GET ON WITH LIFE, TRYING TO ENJOY EVERYTHING I CAN, WHILE HONORING MY BABIES AND GIVING IN TO THE GRIEF WHEN NECESSARY. THINGS ARE BEARABLE. I'LL NEVER BE AT 100% AGAIN - THERE IS TOO MUCH SCARRING. BUT I WORK EVERY DAY TO GET JUST ONE MORE PERCENT HEALED. MY SKIN IS THICKER AND FOR 11 MONTHS OF THE 12 PER YEAR, I AM SMILING AND ABLE TO GET ON WITH IT. THAT SINGLE MONTH IS VERY NEAR. I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BODY...THE NEARING OF OCTOBER. I CAN FEEL THEIR BIRTHDAY APPROACHING; CAN ALMOST HEAR IT, TOUCH IT, SMELL IT. THE LEAVES BEGINNING TO TURN AND THE COOL MORNINGS ARE INDICATORS THAT THE MONTH OF MEMORIES SWIMS NEARER TO ME. I WELCOME THE MEMORIES OF THE TWO BEINGS I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING UP TILL THAT POINT, BUT ALSO SHRINK BACK IN PAIN. THIS WILL BE THE MONTH (ALSO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS), THAT I HAVE TO RELIVE MY KIDS DYING. IT'S THE MONTH I HAVE TO REMEMBER GIVING BIRTH, WHILE TEARS OF HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FALL DOWN MY FACE. IT'S FREAKING PAINFUL. BUT, IT'S BEARABLE. AND I WILL GET THROUGH IT JUST LIKE I DID LAST YEAR AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IF YOU HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES, KEEP READING. I LOVED THE WAY THIS WRITER EXPRESSED LIFE AS A BEREAVED PARENT. *COPIED FROM STILL STANDING MAGAZINE* A QUESTION IM FREQUENTLY ASKED BY BEREAVED PARENTS IS, DOES ITEVERGET EASIER? THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES IS PALPABLE. I KNOW. I GET IT. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION STILL SCARES ME TOO BECAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EASIER FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS STRAIGHT. AND IT WASNT LONG AGO THAT I WAS ASKING BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WERE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD OF GRIEF THAN I WAS THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. IM NOT SURE WHEN I STOPPED ASKING IT PROBABLY WHEN I REALIZED IT MIGHT NOT EVER HAPPEN. STRADDLING HEAVEN AND EARTH ISNT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DESCRIBE ASEASY. EASIERIS A TRICKY WORD WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING AS PERMANENTLY HORRIFIC AS CHILD LOSS. I LIKE TO RESERVE THE WORDEASIERFOR THINGS LIKE LEARNING A NEW SKILL OVER TIME. EASIER IS A NICE LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BEMEASURED.ITS ALSO A LOVELY LITTLE WORD FOR THINGS THAT ARENT IRRETRIEVABLY LOST AND PERMANENTLY MISSING. FOREVER AND EVER. IM CERTAIN THE PROGRESS OF MOVING THROUGH THE UNCHARTED WATERS OF GRIEF AFTER THE LOSS OF A CHILD IS IMMEASURABLE. ITS ONE STEP FORWARD, FOUR STEPS BACK. ITS TREADING WATER, WITH YOUR HEAD SLIGHTLY ABOVE, UNTIL YOURE NOT. ITS SWIMMING ALONG, THEN DROWNING WITHOUT NOTICE. ITS NOT LINEAR. I WILL REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT GRIEF. WHETHER IN A DAY, A YEAR, OR A LIFETIME GRIEF ISNOTLINEAR. EVEN STILL, SEVEN YEARS LATER, I THINK IM SAILING ALONGOK,THEN ALL OF A SUDDENSMACKOUT OF NOWHERE GRIEF BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF ME. SOMETIMES IT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF A STRATEGICALLY PLACED GORGEOUS NINE YEAR OLD, BLUE-EYED LITTLE BOY WHO SHOULD BE MY LIVING BREATHING OLDEST SON, BUT WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONGS TO ANOTHER MOTHER WHO IS CALLING AFTER HIM; SOMETIMES IT COMES FROM THE MISSING PUZZLE PIECE OF MY HEART THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF MY SON THAT STARTS OOZING UNCONTROLLABLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND TEARS LEAK OUT OF MY EYES WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. SOMETIMES ITS THE SIMPLE, ALMOST-PERFECT MOMENTS WITH MY 2/3RDS CHILDREN, THAT SMACK ME UPSIDE THE HEAD AND ROB MY LUNGS OF PROPER BREATH. BREATHE,I GASP.BREATHE. THE THING ABOUT LIFE AFTER LOSS IS THAT NO MATTER WHATSOMEONE IS ALWAYS MISSING.NO MATTER WHAT, MY FAMILY IS ALWAYS ACHINGLYINCOMPLETE.I COULD HAVE FOUR MORE CHILDREN, AND THESE FACTS WOULD STILL REMAIN, STARING ME DOWN LIKE A CRUEL BULLY WHO WILL TORMENT ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH I FIGHT BACK. THE REALITY OF CHILD LOSS IS THAT THE WRONG CAN NEVER BE MADE RIGHT. IT CAN NEVER BE FIXED. EVER. LIFE IS IRREPARABLY BROKEN WITHOUT OUR LIVING, BREATHING CHILD(REN) IN IT. LIFE WILL NEVER FEEL A-OKAY AGAIN. SURE IT WILL HAVE MOMENTS OF BITTERSWEET JOY, AND BITTERSWEET HAPPINESS, AND YOU WILL EVENTUALLY LAUGH AGAIN, AND FIND STUPID THINGS FUNNY, BUT IT WILL NEVER AGAIN BE WHAT ITONCE WAS. THERE WILL NEVER AGAIN BE THAT TWITTERPATED FEELING OF HAPPINESS THE KIND THAT FEELS NAIVE NOW, THE KIND YOU WONDER IF EVER EXISTED AT ALL? YOU MIGHT NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE FEELING THAT ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD. YOU CANT FIX IT, MEND IT, OR EVEN CRY IT AWAY. NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS GO BY,THE ACHE REMAINS. SO BACK TOTHEQUESTION DOES IT EVER GET EASIER? THE HARD TRUTH IS A RESOUNDINGNO. NOT FOR ME, ANYWAY. IT HASNT GOTTENEASIERTO LIVE WITHOUT A HUGE PIECE OF MY HEART. GRIEF IS ALWAYS THERE, LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WALK THIS EARTH WITHOUT MY SON. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO BREATHE WHILE CHOKING ON AIR. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE NORMAL ANSWERS TO NORMAL QUESTIONS ANYMORE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO TRY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WHILE HALF OF YOU IS LIVING IN THEWHAT SHOULD BESANDWHY THE HELL IS IT NOT, DAMNIT!IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION,HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER TO WONDER WHAT YOUR CHILD WOULD LOOK LIKE, BE LIKE, SOUND LIKE, ACT LIKE, LIVE LIKE? IT DOESNT GET EASIER, BUT IT BECOMESDIFFERENT SOFTER, AT TIMES LOUDER AT OTHER TIMES. ITS LIKE A STORM. YOU CANT PREDICT WHEN ITS COMING, AND YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL BE ABLE TO FIND SHELTER OR NOT. YOU CANT PREDICT WHETHER YOULL EVEN SURVIVE. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRACE YOURSELF FOR THE IMPACT, AND HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME SOLID GROUND. EVENTUALLY. SOMETIMES YOULL GET SWEPT UNDER BY THE TSUNAMI OF GRIEF; OTHER DAYS YOULL TREAD WATER, AND STILL OTHER DAYS YOULL CHOKE AND GAG ON THE ON-GOING HORROR OF IT ALL. SOME DAYS YOU MIGHT FLOAT ABOVE IT, AND YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL FEEL THE GLORIOUS FEELING OF AIR HITTING YOUR SKIN ABOVE WATER SUN ON YOUR FACE WIND IN YOUR HAIR. THOSE ARE THE VERYGOOD DAYS OF GRIEF,OF LIFE AFTER LOSS. OVER TIME THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF THEM, SO EMBRACE THEM WHEN THEY COME. AND LET THE SUN DRY OUT THE SOGGIER PARTS OF YOU WHENEVER YOU CAN. THE THING IS NOTHING ABOUT LIFE AFTER THE DEATH OF A CHILD ISEASY. I THINK ITS ALL PRETTY DARN FREAKIN HARD. WHETHER YOURE A DAY IN, OR 20 YEARS OUT, I BELIEVE BEING A BEREAVED PARENT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON EARTH. PERIOD. WHAT PEOPLE DONT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IS ITS A LIFE SENTENCE. ONE WE DIDNT ASK FOR, OR WANT ITS ONE WE WERE CHARGED WITH AGAINST OUR WILL. THE LIFE SENTENCE DOESNT CHANGE, OR LESSEN, OR EVERGO AWAY. NOT WITH TIME, NOT WITH A WHOLE LOT OF ANYTHING. WERE FORCED MEMBERS OF THIS HEINOUS CLUB THAT IS EVERY PARENTS WORST NIGHTMARE. A CLUB WE CAN NEVER LEAVE. SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS? WE ARE FORCED TO LEAN INTO IT TO GRIN AND BEAR IT. WE ARE FORCED TO FIND GRIT WE NEVER KNEW WE HAD. WE ARE FORCED TO DIG DEEPER THAN IS PROBABLY HUMANLY POSSIBLE. WE ARE FORCED TO LIVE OUT THIS HORRIFIC LIFE SENTENCE, SOME HOW, SOME WAY, EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING WITHIN US IS SCREAMING,NOOOOOOOOO. WE ARE FORCED TO LEARN HOW TO CONSISTENTLY DO HARD. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BECAUSE, GUESS WHAT? HARD IS THE ONLY CHOICE WE HAVE, THE ONLY CHOICE WE WERE GIVEN. ITS DO YOU WANT HARD, OR HARD? EITHER WE FIND A WAY, OR WE GIVE UP, RIGHT? AND GIVING UP ISNT AN OPTION. SO WE FIND A WAY. AND WE KEEP ON DOING HARD.TOGETHER.WE FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN SAYME TOO, ME TOOWITH US AND OVER TIME WE REALIZE THAT FINDING A VILLAGE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF OUR PAIN WITHOUT WORDS NECESSARY IS REALLY WHAT MAKESALLTHE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD WHEN DOINGHARD. AND JUST BECAUSE ITS HARD, DOESNT MEAN ITS NOT ALSO A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT CAN BE BEAUTIFULANDWE ACHE. WE CAN REBUILD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE FROM THE GROUND UP. WE CAN HONOR OUR PRECIOUS CHILD WITH EVERY BREATH WE TAKE. WE CAN AND WILL BE HAPPY AGAINANDIM GUESSING IT WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS FEEL DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT OUR CHILD. WE LIVEANDWE GRIEVE. IT DOESNT GET EASIER, IT JUST BECOMESDIFFERENT. SOME MIGHT CALL THAT PESSIMISM, BUT FOR ME, ITSTRUTH. ITS SIMPLY THE REALITY OF BEREAVED PARENTHOOD. NOTE: GRIEF IS AS UNIQUE AS EACH PERSONS FINGERPRINT. IVE MET PLENTY OF BEREAVED PARENTS WHO WOULD SAY A RESOUNDING YES, GRIEF DOES GET EASIER OVER TIME. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE FOR THEM. EASIER JUST ISNT THE WORD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. EACH PERSONS EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT. NO TWO PEOPLE GRIEVE THE SAME. AND OUR JOB IS TO MEET EVERYONES EXPERIENCE/REALITY WITH UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT AND LOVE.

201	AFTER ANY TYPE OF TRAUMA (FROM COMBAT TO CAR ACCIDENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT TO CHILD ABUSE), THE BRAIN AND BODY CHANGE. EVERY CELL RECORDS MEMORIES AND EVERY EMBEDDED, TRAUMA-RELATED NEUROPATHWAY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPEATEDLY REACTIVATE. SOMETIMES THE ALTERATIONS THESE IMPRINTS CREATE ARE TRANSITORY, THE SMALL GLITCH OF DISRUPTIVE DREAMS AND MOODS THAT SUBSIDE IN A FEW WEEKS. IN OTHER SITUATIONS THE CHANGES EVOLVE INTO READILY APPARENT SYMPTOMS THAT IMPAIR FUNCTION AND PRESENT IN WAYS THAT INTERFERE WITH JOBS, FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS. ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECTS FOR SURVIVORS IN THE AFTERMATH OF TRAUMA IS UNDERSTANDING THE CHANGES THAT OCCUR, PLUS INTEGRATING WHAT THEY MEAN, HOW THEY AFFECT A LIFE AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO AMELIORATE THEM. LAUNCHING THE RECOVERY PROCESS BEGINS WITH NORMALIZING POST-TRAUMA SYMPTOMS BY INVESTIGATING HOW TRAUMA AFFECTS THAT BRAIN AND WHAT SYMPTOMS THESE EFFECTS CREATE.THE 3-PART BRAIN THE TRIUNE BRAIN MODEL, INTRODUCED BY PHYSICIAN AND NEUROSCIENTIST PAUL D. MACLEAN, EXPLAINS THE BRAIN IN THREE PARTS:REPTILIAN (BRAIN STEM): THIS INNERMOST PART OF THE BRAIN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SURVIVAL INSTINCTS AND AUTONOMIC BODY PROCESSES.MAMMALIAN (LIMBIC, MIDBRAIN): THE MIDLEVEL OF THE BRAIN, THIS PART PROCESSES EMOTIONS AND CONVEYS SENSORY RELAYS.NEOMMALIAN (CORTEX, FOREBRAIN): THE MOST HIGHLY EVOLVED PART OF THE BRAIN, THIS AREA OUTER CONTROLS COGNITIVE PROCESSING, DECISION-MAKING, LEARNING, MEMORY AND INHIBITORY FUNCTIONS. DURING A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE, THE REPTILIAN BRAIN TAKES CONTROL, SHIFTING THE BODY INTO REACTIVE MODE. SHUTTING DOWN ALL NON-ESSENTIAL BODY AND MIND PROCESSES, THE BRAIN STEM ORCHESTRATES SURVIVAL MODE. DURING THIS TIME THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM INCREASES STRESS HORMONES AND PREPARES THE BODY TO FIGHT, FLEE OR FREEZE. IN A NORMAL SITUATION, WHEN IMMEDIATE THREAT CEASES, THE PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SHIFTS THE BODY INTO RESTORATIVE MODE. THIS PROCESS REDUCES STRESS HORMONES AND ALLOWS THE BRAIN TO SHIFT BACK TO THE NORMAL TOP-DOWN STRUCTURE OF CONTROL. HOWEVER, FOR THOSE 20 PERCENT OF TRAUMA SURVIVORS WHO GO ON TO DEVELOP SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AN UNMITIGATED EXPERIENCE OF ANXIETY RELATED TO THE PAST TRAUMA THE SHIFT FROM REACTIVE TO RESPONSIVE MODE NEVER OCCURS. INSTEAD, THE REPTILIAN BRAIN, PRIMED TO THREAT AND SUPPORTED BY DYSREGULATED ACTIVITY IN SIGNIFICANT BRAIN STRUCTURES, HOLDS THE SURVIVOR IN A CONSTANT REACTIVE STATE.THE DYSREGULATED POST-TRAUMA BRAIN THE FOUR CATEGORIES OF PTSD SYMPTOMS INCLUDE: INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS (UNWANTED MEMORIES); MOOD ALTERATIONS (SHAME, BLAME, PERSISTENT NEGATIVITY); HYPERVIGILANCE (EXAGGERATED STARTLE RESPONSE); AND AVOIDANCE (OF ALL SENSORY AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA-RELATED MATERIAL). THESE CAUSE CONFUSING SYMPTOMS FOR SURVIVORS WHO DONT UNDERSTAND HOW THEYVE SUDDENLY BECOME SO OUT OF CONTROL IN THEIR OWN MINDS AND BODIES. UNEXPECTED RAGE OR TEARS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, INCREASED HEART RATE, SHAKING, MEMORY LOSS, CONCENTRATION CHALLENGES, INSOMNIA, NIGHTMARES AND EMOTIONAL NUMBING CAN HIJACK BOTH AN IDENTITY AND A LIFE. THE PROBLEM ISNT THAT THE SURVIVOR WONT JUST GET OVER IT BUT THAT SHE NEEDS TIME, HELP AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCOVER HER OWN PATH TO HEALING IN ORDER TO DO SO. THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN SEVERAL CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL IMBALANCES CAN PRESENT AFTER TRAUMA. THEIR EFFECTS ARE ESPECIALLY EXACERBATED BY THREE MAJOR BRAIN FUNCTION DYSREGULATIONS:OVERSTIMULATED AMYGDALA: AN ALMOND-SHAPED MASS LOCATED DEEP IN THE BRAIN, THE AMYGDALA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SURVIVAL-RELATED THREAT IDENTIFICATION, PLUS TAGGING MEMORIES WITH EMOTION. AFTER TRAUMA THE AMYGDALA CAN GET CAUGHT UP IN A HIGHLY ALERT AND ACTIVATED LOOP DURING WHICH IT LOOKS FOR AND PERCEIVES THREAT EVERYWHERE.UNDERACTIVE HIPPOCAMPUS: AN INCREASE IN THE STRESS HORMONE GLUCOCORTICOID KILLS CELLS IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS, WHICH RENDERS IT LESS EFFECTIVE IN MAKING SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS NECESSARY FOR MEMORY CONSOLIDATION. THIS INTERRUPTION KEEPS BOTH THE BODY AND MIND STIMULATED IN REACTIVE MODE AS NEITHER ELEMENT RECEIVES THE MESSAGE THAT THE THREAT HAS TRANSFORMED INTO THE PAST TENSE.INEFFECTIVE VARIABILITY: THE CONSTANT ELEVATION OF STRESS HORMONES INTERFERES WITH THE BODYS ABILITY TO REGULATE ITSELF. THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM REMAINS HIGHLY ACTIVATED LEADING TO FATIGUE OF THE BODY AND MANY OF ITS SYSTEMS, MOST NOTABLY THE ADRENAL.HOW HEALING HAPPENS WHILE CHANGES TO THE BRAIN CAN SEEM, ON THE SURFACE, DISASTROUS AND REPRESENTATIVE OF PERMANENT DAMAGE, THE TRUTH IS THAT ALL OF THESE ALTERATIONS CAN BE REVERSED. THE AMYGDALA CAN LEARN TO RELAX; THE HIPPOCAMPUS CAN RESUME PROPER MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN RECOMMENCE ITS EASY FLOW BETWEEN REACTIVE AND RESTORATIVE MODES. THE KEY TO ACHIEVING A STATE OF NEUTRALITY AND THEN HEALING LIES IN HELPING TO REPROGRAM THE BODY AND MIND. WHILE THE TWO COLLABORATE IN A NATURAL FEEDBACK LOOP, PROCESSES DESIGNED FOR EACH INDIVIDUALLY ARE VAST. HYPNOSIS, NEURO-LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING AND OTHER BRAIN-RELATED MODALITIES CAN TEACH THE MIND TO REFRAME AND RELEASE THE GRIP OF TRAUMA. LIKEWISE, APPROACHES INCLUDING SOMATIC EXPERIENCING, TENSION AND TRAUMA RELEASING EXERCISES AND OTHER BODY-CENTRIC TECHNIQUES CAN HELP THE BODY RECALIBRATE TO NORMALCY. SURVIVORS ARE UNIQUE; THEIR HEALING WILL BE INDIVIDUAL. THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL OR PERSONAL GUARANTEE FOR WHAT WILL WORK (AND THE SAME PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE). HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT WHEN SURVIVORS COMMIT TO A PROCESS OF EXPLORING AND TESTING TREATMENT OPTIONS THEY CAN, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA AND EVEN ELIMINATE SYMPTOMS OF PTSD.
202	NEWLY RELEASED DATA SHOWS THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS ACCOUNT FOR 17 PERCENT OF ALL ARRESTS IN CALIFORNIA WHILE ONLY CONSTITUTING SIX PERCENT OF THE POPULATION. THEY ALSO ACCOUNT FOR A QUARTER OF IN-CUSTODY DEATHS, ACCORDING TO STATE-RUN WEBSITE OPEN JUSTICE. A NEW CRIMINAL JUSTICE TOOL, THE OPEN JUSTICE SITE WAS UNVEILED BY CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL KAMALA HARRIS AND PROVIDES DATA ON ARRESTS AND BOOKINGS, DEATHS IN CUSTODY, AND OFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. THEWEBSITE ALSO FEATURES INTERACTIVE TOOLS THAT ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO SEE THE DATA SETS OVER TIME, AND ACROSS POLICE JURISDICTIONS. THE MOST GLARING REVELATION SO FAR CONCERNS THE RACIAL DISPARITY SEEN REGARDING ARRESTS AND DEATHS IN CUSTODY. IT'S VERY STARK AND WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE ABOUT WHY SO MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE DYING COMPARED TO THE STATE POPULATION," JUSTIN ERLICH, A SPECIAL ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO'S OVERSEEING THE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS, TOLDTHE SACRAMENTO BEE. FOR ARRESTS AND BOOKINGS, THE DATA COMES FROM 64.5 MILLION ARRESTS BETWEEN 1980 AND 2013, AN AVERAGE OF OVER 3,800 PER 100,000 RESIDENTS. THE FINDINGS SHOW AFRICAN-AMERICANS, MALE AND FEMALE, ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED AT ANY AGE MOST NOTABLY BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18-40 AT A 25 PERCENT HIGHER RATE THAN WHITES. HISPANICS ACCOUNT FOR 42 PERCENT OF ARRESTS AND MAKE UP 37 PERCENT OF THE STATE POPULATION. ASIANS HAVE THE LOWEST ARREST RATE AT 3 PERCENT. LOS ANGELES POLICE CHIEF CHARLIE BECK ACKNOWLEDGED THE RACIAL DISPARITIES REFLECTED IN THE NUMBERS AND SAID THAT THE DATA WOULD HELP ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. "OUT OF CRISIS COMES OPPORTUNITY," BECK TOLD THE SACRAMENTO BEE. "WE HAVE A NATIONAL CRISIS IN POLICING. IT'S ALSO A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A STEP FORWARD AND BUILD TRUST WHERE SOMETIMES IN SOME COMMUNITIES IT HAS BEEN LOST." OTHER DATA SETS SHOW THAT SINCE 1980, THERE HAVE BEEN AN AVERAGE OF 10 POLICE OFFICER DEATHS PER YEAR 180 WERE THE RESULT OF A CRIMINAL ACT AND 150 WERE ACCIDENTAL. A TOTAL OF 345 OFFICERS WERE KILLED BETWEEN 1980 AND 2014. THE DATA SETS FOR DEATHS IN CUSTODY SHOW THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN 6,000 BETWEEN 2005 AND 2014, AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT 685 PER YEAR. OF THOSE, 61 PERCENT WERE FROM NATURAL CAUSES. THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE WAS HOMICIDE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AT 14 PERCENT, AND 10 PERCENT WERE SUICIDES. BROKEN DOWN BY ETHNICITY, 41 PERCENT OF THE DEATHS WERE WHITE, 29 PERCENT WERE LATINO AND 24 PERCENT WERE AFRICAN-AMERICANS, WHICH REPRESENTS ROUGHLY A QUARTER OF IN-CUSTODY DEATHS. THE WEBSITE, ACCORDING TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, IS THE CULMINATION OF MONTHS OF WORK AIMED AT PROVIDING DATA ON LAW ENFORCEMENTS INTERACTIONS WITH THE PUBLIC. IT WAS ALSO CREATED TO IMPROVE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AFTER NATIONAL PROTESTS OVER POLICE PRACTICES SPARKED DEBATE OVER THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BEING SMART ON CRIME MEANS MEASURING OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH DATA AND METRICS, SAID HARRIS IN A STATEMENT. THIS INITIATIVE PUTS FORWARD A COMMON SET OF FACTS, DATA AND GOALS SO THAT WE CAN HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE AND IMPROVE. OFFICIALS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER STATE DEPARTMENT IN THE COUNTRY WITH A SIMILAR EFFORT AND HOPE THAT THEIR ACTIONS WILL INSPIRE OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW SUIT.

203	UPDATE. IS YOUR DOCTOR KEEPING A SECRET FROM YOU? IF YOU DONT KNOW YOUR BREAST DENSITY, YOU DONT HAVE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR BREAST HEALTH, SAID NANCY CAPPELLO, A FORMER EDUCATION ADMINISTRATOR FROM WOODBURY, CONNECTICUT, WHO STARTED THE ARE YOU DENSE CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE OTHER WOMEN. CAPPELLO CALLS BREAST DENSITY A BEST-KEPT SECRET. IF YOU HAVE A MAMMOGRAM, YOUR DOCTOR KNOWS YOUR BREAST DENSITY, BUT IS HE SHARING THIS CRITICAL INFORMATION WITH YOU? DEPENDING ON WHICH STATE YOU LIVE IN, THE ANSWER COULD BE NO. NANCYS STORY CAPPELLOS STORY IS SHOCKING. AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF ROUTINE ANNUAL MAMMOGRAMS AND THE HAPPY GRAM REPORTS THAT SHOWED HER RESULTS AS NORMAL WITH NO SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS, CAPPELLO WAS TOLD SHE HAD CANCER WHEN A DOCTOR NOTICED A SUSPICIOUS RIDGE IN HER RIGHT BREAST DURING AN ANNUAL PHYSICAL EXAM. A SUBSEQUENT MAMMOGRAM REVEALED NOTHING, BUT AN ULTRASOUND SHOWED STAGE 3C CANCER THAT HAD SPREAD TO 13 LYMPH NODES. FROM THE SIZE AND HOW IT METASTASIZED, THE CANCER HAD BEEN GROWING FOR SIX YEARS, CAPPELLO SAID. AS A HEALTHY WOMAN AND EDUCATED PATIENT WHO WATCHED HER WEIGHT, EXERCISED REGULARLY AND NEVER MISSED A MAMMOGRAM APPOINTMENT, CAPPELLO WAS BOWLED OVER TO LEARN SHE HAD ADVANCED BREAST CANCER. THATS WHEN HER DOCTOR TOLD HER ABOUT HER DENSE BREAST TISSUE AND HOW IT CAN HIDE CANCER ON A MAMMOGRAM.  THE RESPONSE WAS THAT ITS NOT STANDARD PROTOCOL TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH THE PATIENT, CAPPELLO SAID. SHE WENT INTO ACTION, AND CONNECTICUT WAS THE FIRST STATE TO PASS A BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAW. WHAT DOES DENSE MEAN? DENSE BREAST TISSUE IS NOT ABNORMAL.  6; DEJONGE, NO. ITS JUST THE WAY A WOMAN IS BUILT, SAID DR. KATHRYN EVERS, DIRECTOR OF BREAST IMAGING AT FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER IN PHILADELPHIA. ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS DENSE BREAST TISSUE, WHICH MEANS THAT IT HAS A HIGH PROPORTION OF GLANDULAR OR CONNECTIVE TISSUE. A RADIOLOGIST READS A MAMMOGRAM AND RATES IT IN FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FROM EXTREMELY FATTY TO EXTREMELY DENSE, SAID DR. EMILY F. CONANT, PROFESSOR AND CHIEF, DIVISION OF BREAST IMAGING, DEPARTMENT OF RADIOLOGY, HOSPITAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. TEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE HAVE ENTIRELY FATTY BREAST TISSUE AND 10 PERCENT HAVE EXTREMELY DENSE BREAST TISSUE. THE OTHER 80 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS BROKEN DOWN EVENLY BETWEEN SCATTERED FIBROGLANDULAR (FATTY) TISSUE AND HETEROGENEOUSLY DENSE. DENSE BREAST TISSUE CAMOUFLAGES TUMORS ON A MAMMOGRAM, EVERS SAID. FATTY TISSUE SHOWS UP GREYISH BLACK ON A MAMMOGRAM, MAKING IT STAND OUT. DENSE TISSUE LOOKS WHITE. BREAST MASSES OR TUMORS ALSO APPEAR WHITE ON A MAMMOGRAM, MAKING THEM HARD OR IMPOSSIBLE TO SPOT IN DENSE BREASTS. PAGE 2 OF 3 - BREAST DENSITY VARIES BY AGE AND WEIGHT, CONANT SAID. AS WOMEN AGE THEIR BREASTS BECOME LESS DENSE. WOMEN WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE OFTEN HAVE DENSER BREASTS. NOT ONLY CAN DENSE BREAST TISSUE HIDE CANCER ON A MAMMOGRAM, THERE IS SOME INCREASED RISK FOR BREAST CANCER FOR WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS, EVERS SAID. ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO TELL IF YOUR BREASTS ARE DENSE BY SIGHT OR FEEL. ITS NOT A MATTER OF A BREAST FEELING FIRM OR LUMPY, EVERS SAID. BREAST DENSITY CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY A MAMMOGRAM, SHE SAID. INFORMATION VS. EXPENSE AND THATS WHERE A BIT OF CONTROVERSY COMES IN, CONANT SAID. TWENTY-FOUR STATES HAVE LAWS THAT REQUIRE HEALTH FACILITIES TO NOTIFY WOMEN IF THEY HAVE DENSE BREASTS. ELEVEN OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAWS, AND NATIONWIDE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS. A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW AND DESERVES TO BE EDUCATED SO SHE CAN MAKE INFORMED HEALTH-CARE CHOICES AND POSSIBLY SEEK ADDITIONAL SCREENING METHODS, CAPPELLO SAID. THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT, THOUGH, IS WARY OF CREATING PANIC AND ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO SEEK OUT COSTLY ADDITIONAL SCREENING TESTS, CONANT SAID. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW THEIR BREAST DENSITY, CONANT SAYS. BUT TELLING WOMEN CAUSES FRUSTRATION BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THERE ARE RISKS AND BENEFITS TO MAMMOGRAMS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE NEGATIVES. FOR A WOMAN WITH DENSE BREASTS, AN ULTRASOUND IS A COMPLEMENTARY SCREENING, CONANT SAID: USED WITH MAMMOGRAMS, ULTRASOUNDS MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING BREAST CANCER BUT THEY COME WITH MANY FALSE NEGATIVES AND POSITIVES. AN MRI IS A VERY GOOD TOOL. IT FINDS MORE CANCERS THAN A MAMMOGRAM AND HAS SLIGHTLY FEWER FALSE POSITIVES THAN A MAMMOGRAM, CONANT SAID. BUT MRIS CAN COST THOUSANDS, AND INSURANCE WONT COVER IT IN THE CASE OF A WOMAN WHO HAS DENSE BREASTS AND NO OTHER HIGH-RISK FACTORS. THREE-DIMENSIONAL MAMMOGRAMS ARE THE BEST SCREENING METHOD FOR BREAST CANCER, CONANT SAID. ITS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE HAVING. THE BENEFITS OF 3-D MAMMOGRAMS INCLUDE THE ABILITY FOR THE RADIOLOGIST TO ZOOM IN, MAGNIFY AND CHANGE THE CONTRAST OF THE BREAST IMAGE AND VIEW IT IN SLICES FOR MORE PRECISE IMAGES, FLEXIBLE PLATES FOR GREATER COMFORT AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FALSE POSITIVES. ADVICE THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY RECOMMENDS WOMEN GET AN ANNUAL MAMMOGRAM STARTING AT AGE 40, CONTINUING AS LONG AS A WOMANS IN GOOD HEALTH. AS A WOMAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOUR DOCTOR, CAPPELLO SAID. THE INFORMATION SHOULD NEVER BE HIDDEN. FIND OUT YOUR BREAST DENSITY AND WHAT IMPACT IT CAN HAVE ON YOUR BREAST HEALTH.

205	MAX MUMBY/INDIGO/ (LONDON) -- PRINCE HARRY IS BACK IN GREAT BRITAIN, SPORTING A NEW BEARD AND CELEBRATING HIS 31ST BIRTHDAY AFTER A LONG SUMMER AWAY FROM LONDON AT THE FRONT LINES OF ANTI-POACHING EFFORTS IN AFRICA. HARRY, WHO RETIRED FROM THE MILITARY EARLIER THIS SUMMER, DECIDED TO CELEBRATE HIS BIRTHDAY TUESDAY BY HONORING WORLD WAR II SPITFIRE PILOTS ON THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN. SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL ONCE CALLED THE PILOTS "THE FEW STILL ALIVE" AND HARRY SPENT THE DAY HONORING THE VETERANS, MANY OF WHOM ARE NOW IN THEIR 90S. THE WWII SPITFIRE AND HURRICANE PILOTS TOOK TO THE SKIES AT THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN FLYPAST IN CHICHESTER, ENGLAND, TO MARK THE ANNIVERSARY. PRINCE HARRY, THE FIFTH-IN-LINE TO THE BRITISH THRONE, DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS UNBELIEVABLY FORTUNATE AND LUCKY TO BE CELEBRATING AT THE EVENT ON HIS BIRTHDAY. HARRY, A CERTIFIED PILOT HIMSELF, WAS SUPPOSED TO GET IN THE COCKPIT AND FLY WITH THE VETERANS, BUT WHEN ONE OF THE PLANES BROKE, THE PRINCE GAVE UP HIS SEAT SO THAT 95-YEAR-OLD WING COMMANDER TOM NEIL COULD TAKE PART IN HONORING HIS FELLOW HEROES. I CAN'T BEGIN TO COMPREHEND WHAT THEY MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH, HARRY TOLD BRITAIN'S CHANNEL 4, WHICH IS PREPARING A DOCUMENTARY, BATTLE OF BRITAIN: RETURN OF THE SPITFIRES , ON THE WWII HEROES. WHILE HARRY FOCUSED ON THE VETERANS ON HIS BIRTHDAY, THE PRINCE WILL REPORTEDLY BE THE GUEST OF HONOR AT A BOAT PARTY ON THE THAMES LATER THIS WEEK ORGANIZED BY HIS FRIENDS TO WELCOME HIM BACK. THE PRINCE SPENT THE LAST THREE MONTHS TRACKING LIONS IN A REMOTE REGION OF NAMIBIA AND WORKING ON THE FRONT LINES IN THE ANTI-POACHING EFFORTS TO SAVE THE ENDANGERED RHINO IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. NOW THAT HE IS BACK IN ENGLAND, PRINCE HARRY HAS A BUSY FALL AHEAD OF HIM WITH MULTIPLE ROYAL ENGAGEMENTS AND TWO FOREIGN TRIPS. ON FRIDAY, THE PRINCE, THE PATRON OF ENGLANDS RUGBY FOOTBALL UNION, WILL ATTEND THE RUGBY WORLD CUP WITH HIS BROTHER, PRINCE WILLIAM, AND SISTER-IN-LAW, THE DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE. HARRY WILL FOCUS HIS ATTENTIONS ON WOUNDED SOLDIERS AND VETERANS AGAIN THIS FALL BY HELPING THEM TRANSITION BACK TO WORK AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES. HE WILL SUPPORT, THROUGH HIS CHARITY, WALKING WITH THE WOUNDED, THE WALK OF BRITAIN, AN EXPEDITION IN WHICH FOUR BRITISH AND TWO U.S. WOUNDED VETERANS ARE WALKING 1,000 MILES ACROSS BRITAIN, ENDING AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE IN NOVEMBER. IN LATE OCTOBER, PRINCE HARRY WILL MAKE HIS FIRST OF SEVERAL FOREIGN TRIPS, BEGINNING WITH A TRIP TO WASHINGTON, D.C., TO BEGIN WORK ON THE 2016 INVICTUS GAMES, A WOUNDED WARRIORS ATHLETIC EVENT THAT WILL BE HELD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE U.S. AT ESPNS WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS COMPLEX IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA. FURTHER DOWN THE LINE, PRINCE HARRY WILL VENTURE BACK TO LESOTHO FOR THE OPENING OF THE CHILDREN'S MAMOHATO CENTER, A CHILDRENS CENTER THAT WILL SERVE AS THE FLAGSHIP FACILITY FOR THE AIDS-FOCUSED CHARITY, SENTEBALE, HARRY FOUNDED MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO IN HONOR OF HIS LATE MOTHER, PRINCESS DIANA. PRINCE HARRY WILL ALSO UNDERTAKE A TOUR TO SOUTH AFRICA IN LATE NOVEMBER ON BEHALF OF HIS GRANDMOTHER, THE QUEEN. COPYRIGHT 2015, ABC RADIO. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
206	UPDATED. BLAENAU GWENT COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO CONTROL ITS SPENDING TO AVOID AN UNPLANNED DRAW FROM ITS RESERVES, A REPORT BEING SUBMIZTTED TO COUNCILLORS TOMORROW HAS REVEALED. AN UPDFATE ON SPENDING BY THE COUNCILS CHIEF FINANCE ODFFICER SAID THE COUNCIL IS SET TO SPEND 440,000 LESS THAN WAS EXPECTED BY THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR BUT THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES AHEAD. WHILE OVERALL SPENDING ACROSS ALL COUNCIL AREAS IS LESS THAN EXPECTED, THE REVENUE BUDGET MONITORING FORECAST REPORT REVEALED FIVE COUNCIL DEPARTMENTS ARE SET TO OVERSPEND BY 640,000. THE REPORT SAID A MAJOR RISK IS THAT EXPENDITURE EXCEEDS THE BUDGET AT THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR, LEADING TO UNPLANNED DRAW FROM THE COUNCILS GENERAL RESERVES. CHIEF ACCOUNTAONT AT THE COUNCIL, GINA TAYLOR, WROTTE IN THE REPORT: IT IS ALL PORTFFOLIOS CONTINUE TO CONTROL EXPENDITURE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN UNDERSPENDS OR TO MITNIMISE FURTHER OVERSPENDS. THIS WILL ASSIST IN MITIGATING ANY POTENTIAL UNPLANNED DRAW FROM RESERVES. 1.1 MILLION HAS ALREADY BEEN DRAWN FROM COUNCIL RESERVES TO FVUND ONE-OFF PLANNED EXPENDITURE THIS YEAR.  PROMOTED STORIES ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, WHICH FORECASTS WHETHER THE COUNCIL WILL MEET ITS BUDGET BY THE END OF THE YEAR, FOUR COUNCIL DEPARTMENTS ARE SET TO UNDERSPEND BY THE END OF THE FINAFNCIAL YEAR. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND SDTRATEGY IS UNDERSPENDING BECAUSE OF SAVINGS IN STAFF COSTS WHILE HIGHWAYS AND TRANSPORT HAS SPENT LESS BECAUSE OF TWO VACANT JOB POSTS AND LESS MONEY SPENT STREET LIGHTING UTILITY COSTS. BUT ONE "COST PRESSURE" IN HIGHWAYS AND TRANSPORT IS THE NEW MECHANICAL LINK IN EBBW VALE WHICH HAS HIGHER THKAN AINTICXIPATED REVENUE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS. SOCIAL SERVICES OVERALLG SAW AN UNDERSPEND THANKS TO GRANT FUNDING AND HEALTH CARE INCOME, ALTHOUGH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CHMILDREN IN CHILDRENS HOMES MEANT CHILDRENS SERVICES IS TO OVERSPEND. SHARE ARTICLEW AMONG THE DEPARTMENTS TO OVERSPEND IS PLANNING , BECAUSE OF 40,000 IANCURRED FROM A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO A COUNCIL DECISION ON A WIND FARM, AS WELL AS WASTE MANAGEMENT AND THE THE REPORT IS DUE TO BE REVIEWED BY THE COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON WEDNESDAY MORNING.
207	I WAS ALSO VERY PROUD THAT THEY SAID OURS WAS THE LARGEST RECEPTION THEYVE RECEIVED YET. THE GROUP WAS EXPECTED THIS MORNING TO START BACK AGAIN ON ITS 3,300 MILE JOURNEY ONE THAT WILL TAKE 29 DAYS TO COMPLETE.IN 1920, THE ARMY DECIDED TO PLAN AND EXECUTE A MOTOR CONVOY OF VARIOUS MILITARY VEHICLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON THE NEWLY FORMED BANKHEAD HIGHWAY.

208	IF YOU COULD CHOOSE WHAT OR WHO TO SPEND YOUR NEXT LIFE AS, WHAT WOULD YOUR CHOICE BE? WHY? IF YOU WOULDPREFER TO LEAVE IT UP TO SOME OTHER POWER TO DECIDE,WHY? TANYA: THIS ONE IS SOOOOOO...EASY!!! IN MY NEXT LIFE I WANT TO BE A BLACK DIVA SOUL SINGER. YOU SEE, I KNOW I HAVE AN INNER ARETHA; WHEN THE MUSIC BEGINS I FEEL HER SWELLING WITHIN ME JUST BURSTING TO BE SET FREE...MY BODY IS GYRATING, I AM FEELING THE SPIRIT WITH EVERY FIBRE OF MY BEING.THE RUB IS, I OPEN MY MOUTH AND THERE IS A PROFOUNDLY SAD DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT I AM SURE IS SURGING THROUGH MY BODY AND WHAT I HEAR EMANATING FROM MY VOCAL CHORDS. SOMETHING ALWAYS GOES TERRIBLY WRONG AS THE SOUND RISES OUT OF MY BODY.IF ONLY IT SOUNDED THE WAY IT FEELS I WOULD BE OVERCOME WITH JOY! SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. HANDS DOWN, NEXT LIFE I CHOOSE TO BE A SOUL SISTER! DAVE W: I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THIS TOPIC FOR THE LAST WEEK AND I CAN'T ESCAPE THE FIRST ANSWER THAT CAME TO ME: IF I COULD CHOOSE WHO I WOULD BE IN MY NEXT LIFE, I WOULD CHOOSE TO BE MYSELF. BUT A HIGHER-EVOLVED RENDITION OF MYSELF. A PERSON WHO, AS A YOUTH, WOULD NOT BE AS FEARFUL OF HIS FATHER, WHO WOULD STAND UP FOR HIMSELF TO BULLIES (BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND FOR OTHERS), WHO WOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THOUGHT, WHO WOULDN'T BE AFRAID OF BEING KNOWN AS "SMART", WHO WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT APPLYING ONESELF IN ATHLETICS IS GOING TO CAUSE PAIN BUT THAT THE PAIN IS TEMPORARY AND THE BENEFITS LONG-LASTING, WHO WOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF ASKING GIRLS OUT AND PUTTING HIS HEART ON THE LINE AND WHO WOULD GO AWAY TO COLLEGE. FAR, FAR AWAY. JAIME: AS I SLIPPED ON MY THREADBARE, BUT FAVORITE JEANS TODAY, THE ONES WHERE THE BELT LOOPS HAVE ALMOST BEEN COMPLETELY TORN OFF THE PANTS THEMSELVES, I REALIZED, THAT'S IT! I WANT TO COME BACK AS A WELL-WORN AND BELOVED PAIR OF BLUE JEANS. IF YOU PUT OUT OF YOUR MIND FOR A MOMENT, THE FACT THAT YOUR OWNER'S CROTCH AND BEHIND WILL RUB UP AGAINST YOU FOR HOURS AT A TIME, AND POSSIBLY FOR YEARS ON END, I HOPE I CAN HELP YOU COME TO UNDERSTAND THE UNCONDITIONAL BOND THAT FORMS BETWEEN A PERSON AND THEIR FAVORITE PAIR OF JEANS. AS THE PERFECT PAIR OF DENIM, I WOULD BE LOVED FROM THE MOMENT I WAS TRIED ON IN THE FITTING ROOM TO THE DAY I WOULD SORROWFULLY BE DONATED TO GOODWILL. ONLY AS A PAIR OF JEANS WOULD I BE LOVED MORE AND MORE WITH EACH PASSING DAY AND WASH. EACH ITERATION IN MY LIFE CYCLE WOULD BRING MY OWNERNEW-FOUNDHAPPINESS, CONFIDENCE, AND COMFORT. AS MY TEXTURE AND STRUCTURE CHANGE OVER TIME, PERHAPS A TEAR HERE OR THERE, OR A BIT OF FADING, I COULD BE REINCARNATED AGAIN AND AGAIN. I WOULD BE APPRECIATED FOR THE FAMILIARITY I OFFER, AND YET THE NEWNESS THAT COMES WITH MY EVER-CHANGING APPEARANCE AND FIT. WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR US TO PART, IT WOULD BE WITH SADNESS, BUT ALSO WITH THE HOPE THAT I WOULD OFFER MY NEXT OWNER THE SAME JOY AND SATISFACTION EXPERIENCED DURING OUR TIME TOGETHER. OKAY, THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A STRETCH, BUT IT WAS FUN TO THINK ABOUT. STEVE: I LIKE KRISTINE'S APPROACH TO THIS THEME, SO HERE'S MY ANSWER-- IN THIS MOMENT: I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND AN INCARNATION AS A CHERRY TREE. EACH YEARI'D SPEND A SEASON COVERED IN BEAUTIFUL BLOSSOMS, AND THEN I'D LET GO OF ALL OF THE PETALS IN BREEZY PINK FLURRIES. I'D MAKE DELICIOUS, JUICY CHERRIES FOR LOVERS TO FEED EACH OTHER AND FOR PARENTS TO BAKE INTO PIES. AND THEN I'D GET TO JUST HANG OUT FOR A WHILE, UNDER THE RADAR, MAYBE A FEW BIRDS NESTING IN MY BRANCHES NOW AND THEN. AND DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, YEAR AFTER YEAR, UNTIL IT'S TIME FOR MY NEXT LIFE. KRISTINE: IN THIS MOMENT THIS IS MY ANSWER--- A CLOUD EVER CHANGING LIGHT REFLECTING FASTLYMOVED HANGING STILL LIGHT AND FLUFFY DARK ANDMENACING HERE THEN GONE

211	IS YOUR DOCTOR KEEPING A SECRET FROM YOU? IF YOU DONT KNOW YOUR BREAST DENSITY, YOU DONT HAVE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR BREAST HEALTH, SAID NANCY CAPPELLO, A FORMER EDUCATION ADMINISTRATOR FROM WOODBURY, CONNECTICUT, WHO STARTED THE ARE YOU DENSE CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE OTHER WOMEN. CAPPELLO CALLS BREAST DENSITY A BEST-KEPT SECRET. IF YOU HAVE A MAMMOGRAM, YOUR DOCTOR KNOWS YOUR BREAST DENSITY, BUT IS HE SHARING THIS CRITICAL INFORMATION WITH YOU? DEPENDING ON WHICH STATE YOU LIVE IN, THE ANSWER COULD BE NO. NANCYS STORY CAPPELLOS STORY IS SHOCKING. AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF ROUTINE ANNUAL MAMMOGRAMS AND THE HAPPY GRAM REPORTS THAT SHOWED HER RESULTS AS NORMAL WITH NO SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS, CAPPELLO WAS TOLD SHE HAD CANCER WHEN A DOCTOR NOTICED A SUSPICIOUS RIDGE IN HER RIGHT BREAST DURING AN ANNUAL PHYSICAL EXAM. A SUBSEQUENT MAMMOGRAM REVEALED NOTHING, BUT AN ULTRASOUND SHOWED STAGE 3C CANCER THAT HAD SPREAD TO 13 LYMPH NODES. FROM THE SIZE AND HOW IT METASTASIZED, THE CANCER HAD BEEN GROWING FOR SIX YEARS, CAPPELLO SAID. AS A HEALTHY WOMAN AND EDUCATED PATIENT WHO WATCHED HER WEIGHT, EXERCISED REGULARLY AND NEVER MISSED A MAMMOGRAM APPOINTMENT, CAPPELLO WAS BOWLED OVER TO LEARN SHE HAD ADVANCED BREAST CANCER. THATS WHEN HER DOCTOR TOLD HER ABOUT HER DENSE BREAST TISSUE AND HOW IT CAN HIDE CANCER ON A MAMMOGRAM. I ASKED, WHY WASNT I TOLD I HAVE DENSE BREAST TISSUE? THE RESPONSE WAS THAT ITS NOT STANDARD PROTOCOL TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH THE PATIENT, CAPPELLO SAID. SHE WENT INTO ACTION, AND CONNECTICUT WAS THE FIRST STATE TO PASS A BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAW. WHAT DOES DENSE MEAN? DENSE BREAST TISSUE IS NOT ABNORMAL. ITS JUST THE WAY A WOMAN IS BUILT, SAID DR. KATHRYN EVERS, DIRECTOR OF BREAST IMAGING AT FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER IN PHILADELPHIA. ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS DENSE BREAST TISSUE, WHICH MEANS THAT IT HAS A HIGH PROPORTION OF GLANDULAR OR CONNECTIVE TISSUE. A RADIOLOGIST READS A MAMMOGRAM AND RATES IT IN FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FROM EXTREMELY FATTY TO EXTREMELY DENSE, SAID DR. EMILY F. CONANT, PROFESSOR AND CHIEF, DIVISION OF BREAST IMAGING, DEPARTMENT OF RADIOLOGY, HOSPITAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. TEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE HAVE ENTIRELY FATTY BREAST TISSUE AND 10 PERCENT HAVE EXTREMELY DENSE BREAST TISSUE. THE OTHER 80 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS BROKEN DOWN EVENLY BETWEEN SCATTERED FIBROGLANDULAR (FATTY) TISSUE AND HETEROGENEOUSLY DENSE. DENSE BREAST TISSUE CAMOUFLAGES TUMORS ON A MAMMOGRAM, EVERS SAID. FATTY TISSUE SHOWS UP GREYISH BLACK ON A MAMMOGRAM, MAKING IT STAND OUT. DENSE TISSUE LOOKS WHITE. BREAST MASSES OR TUMORS ALSO APPEAR WHITE ON A MAMMOGRAM, MAKING THEM HARD OR IMPOSSIBLE TO SPOT IN DENSE BREASTS. PAGE 2 OF 3 - BREAST DENSITY VARIES BY AGE AND WEIGHT, CONANT SAID. AS WOMEN AGE THEIR BREASTS BECOME LESS DENSE. WOMEN WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE OFTEN HAVE DENSER BREASTS. NOT ONLY CAN DENSE BREAST TISSUE HIDE CANCER ON A MAMMOGRAM, THERE IS SOME INCREASED RISK FOR BREAST CANCER FOR WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS, EVERS SAID. ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO TELL IF YOUR BREASTS ARE DENSE BY SIGHT OR FEEL. ITS NOT A MATTER OF A BREAST FEELING FIRM OR LUMPY, EVERS SAID. BREAST DENSITY CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY A MAMMOGRAM, SHE SAID. INFORMATION VS. EXPENSE AND THATS WHERE A BIT OF CONTROVERSY COMES IN, CONANT SAID. TWENTY-FOUR STATES HAVE LAWS THAT REQUIRE HEALTH FACILITIES TO NOTIFY WOMEN IF THEY HAVE DENSE BREASTS. ELEVEN OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAWS, AND NATIONWIDE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS. A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW AND DESERVES TO BE EDUCATED SO SHE CAN MAKE INFORMED HEALTH-CARE CHOICES AND POSSIBLY SEEK ADDITIONAL SCREENING METHODS, CAPPELLO SAID. THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT, THOUGH, IS WARY OF CREATING PANIC AND ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO SEEK OUT COSTLY ADDITIONAL SCREENING TESTS, CONANT SAID. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW THEIR BREAST DENSITY, CONANT SAYS. BUT TELLING WOMEN CAUSES FRUSTRATION BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THERE ARE RISKS AND BENEFITS TO MAMMOGRAMS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE NEGATIVES. FOR A WOMAN WITH DENSE BREASTS, AN ULTRASOUND IS A COMPLEMENTARY SCREENING, CONANT SAID: USED WITH MAMMOGRAMS, ULTRASOUNDS MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING BREAST CANCER BUT THEY COME WITH MANY FALSE NEGATIVES AND POSITIVES. AN MRI IS A VERY GOOD TOOL. IT FINDS MORE CANCERS THAN A MAMMOGRAM AND HAS SLIGHTLY FEWER FALSE POSITIVES THAN A MAMMOGRAM, CONANT SAID. BUT MRIS CAN COST THOUSANDS, AND INSURANCE WONT COVER IT IN THE CASE OF A WOMAN WHO HAS DENSE BREASTS AND NO OTHER HIGH-RISK FACTORS. THREE-DIMENSIONAL MAMMOGRAMS ARE THE BEST SCREENING METHOD FOR BREAST CANCER, CONANT SAID. ITS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE HAVING. THE BENEFITS OF 3-D MAMMOGRAMS INCLUDE THE ABILITY FOR THE RADIOLOGIST TO ZOOM IN, MAGNIFY AND CHANGE THE CONTRAST OF THE BREAST IMAGE AND VIEW IT IN SLICES FOR MORE PRECISE IMAGES, FLEXIBLE PLATES FOR GREATER COMFORT AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FALSE POSITIVES. ADVICE THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY RECOMMENDS WOMEN GET AN ANNUAL MAMMOGRAM STARTING AT AGE 40, CONTINUING AS LONG AS A WOMANS IN GOOD HEALTH.

212	PHILADELPHIA, SEPT. 23, 2015 /PRNEWSWIRE-USNEWSWIRE/ -- ATTORNEY STEPHEN SHELLER FIRST CONNECTED THE USE OF THE POWERFUL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG RISPERDAL IN CHILDREN WITH THE DEVASTATING CONDITION OF GYNECOMASTIA, THE GROWTH OF FEMALE-LIKE BREASTS IN BOYS AND YOUNG MEN. THE PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEY ALSO FOUND THAT THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY AND ITS JANSSEN DIVISION WERE ILLEGALLY PROMOTING THE DRUG FOR USE IN CHILDREN. BOTH SET IN MOTION A DECADE-LONG PURSUIT OF JUSTICE. SHELLER'S PURSUIT IS HIGHLIGHTED IN WHAT NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST NICHOLAS KRISTOF IS CALLING A "DEVASTATING, EPIC" REPORT ON J&J, "AMERICA'S MOST ADMIRED LAWBREAKER" BY VETERAN JOURNALIST STEVEN BRILL. THE 15-CHAPTER EXPOSE ON THE HIGHLINE IMPRINT OF THE HUFFINGTON POST IS BEING RELEASED CHAPTER BY CHAPTER ONLINE THROUGH SEPTEMBER 29. BRILL WRITES A NARRATIVE WEAVING MULTIMEDIA INTERVIEWS, COURT AND INTERNAL J&J DOCUMENTS, IMAGES AND VIDEO IN A FORMAT UNIQUE IN TODAY'S JOURNALISM TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW A CORPORATION PUT "PROFITS OVER PEOPLE." HE DIGS INTO THE GENESIS OF HOW A DRUG INTENDED FOR THE SEVERE DISORDERS SCHIZOPHRENIA AND BI-POLAR MANIA, APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR ONLY THAT NARROW POPULATION, WAS MARKETED BY J&J FOR USE IN CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS THREE YEARS OLD. THERE WERE TWO AVENUES FOR SHELLER TO TRAVERSE, SEPARATE BUT RELATED: FILING HUNDREDS OF INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST J&J ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE INVESTIGATION OF ILLEGAL CONDUCT DEFRAUDING THE GOVERNMENT'S HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS LEADING TO A $2.2 BILLION RECOVERY THE LARGEST SINGLE PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG FRAUD SETTLEMENT IN U.S. HISTORY. BRILL'S REPORTING PROVIDES AN INSIDE LOOK OF HOW SHELLER HAS NAVIGATED THE UNUSUAL AND DIFFICULT LEGAL TERRAIN. SHELLER, P.C.'S INVESTIGATION AND ITS LEGAL REPRESENTATION OF HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN AND THEIR FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY LEAD TO TRIALS THAT BEGAN TWO YEARS AGO, WITH A RECENT $2.5 MILLION VERDICT ON BEHALF OF A YOUNG BOY WHO DEVELOPED 46DD BREASTS. TRIALS FOR OTHER AFFECTED YOUNG MEN CONTINUE NEXT MONTH AND INTO 2016. CONCURRENT TO SHELLER'S PURSUIT OF JUSTICE FOR GYNECOMASTIA VICTIMS, SHELLER WAS CONTACTED IN 2003 BY A J&J PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETING REPRESENTATIVE WHO WAS ALARMED BY THE COMPANY'S PROMOTION OF THE DRUG FOR USE IN CHILDREN. SHELLER AND THE WHISTLEBLOWER PROVIDED THE BASIS FOR AN INVESTIGATION BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INTO THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF J&J THAT IN 2013 ENDED IN THE MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT ON BEHALF OF U.S. TAXPAYERS. "WE LAUD STEVE BRILL FOR HIS COMPREHENSIVE AND COMPELLING LOOK INTO J&J'S CONDUCT REGARDING RISPERDAL," SAYS STEPHEN SHELLER. "WE'RE SCHEDULED FOR MORE TRIALS IN COURT NEXT MONTH, BUT BRILL BRINGS DESPICABLE CORPORATE GREED TO THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION."

THE MAN WAS AT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY AND NOW HIS SON, 22, IS IN HOSPITAL IN CRITICAL CONDITION. HINDUTVA FUNDAMENTALISTS WANT TO BAN BEEF ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE COW IS CONSIDERED SACRED TO HINDUISM. MSGR. MASCARENHAS: "BUT THE HINDU MAJORITY IS TOLERANT. I APPEAL TO IT, IN ORDER TO CONDEMN THE EXTREMIST NATIONALIST FRINGE ". LUCKNOW (ASIANEWS) - AN INDIAN MAN OF 50, MOHAMMAD AKHLAQ, RESIDENT IN THE VILLAGE OF BISARA (IN THE INDIAN STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH), WAS ATTACKED AND BEATEN TO DEATH FOR ALLEGEDLY HAVING RAISED AND SLAUGHTERED A COW FOR CONSUMPTION IN HIS HOME. HIS 22 YEAR OLD SON, DANISH, IS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE IN HOSPITAL. THE FURY OF ABOUT 100 PEOPLE ARMED WITH IRON BARS AND STICKS, WAS TRIGGERED BY AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN A LOCAL HINDU TEMPLE, WHICH STATED THAT THE MAN HAD CONSUMED BEEF IN HIS HOUSE. MSGR. THEODORE MASCARENHAS, THE AUXILIARY BISHOP OF RANCHI, HAS NOTED: "WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR BELOVED COUNTRY IS REALLY DISTRESSING. DIVISIVE FORCES SEEM TO BE TAKING THE UPPER HAND". BUT THE MAJORITY OF HINDUS ARE TOLERANT, AND THIS IS WHY HE IS LAUNCHING "AN APPEAL TO HINDU BRETHREN, TO SPEAK UP AGAINST THE FUNDAMENTALISTS". THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AROUND 10 PM (LOCAL TIME) ON SEPTEMBER 28, WHEN THE MAN WAS ATTACKED BY AN ANGRY MOB. THE CULPRITS ALSO TRIED TO HARASS HIS 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, SAJIDA, AND HIS ELDERLY GRANDMOTHER WAS HIT IN THE FACE. ON ARRIVAL, THE POLICE TOOK SAMPLES OF MEAT IN THE REFRIGERATOR OF THE HOUSE, AND SENT THEM TO THE FORENSIC DEPARTMENT FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION. SAJIDA, HOWEVER, TOLD THE PRESS THAT THE MEAT IS MOUFLON AND NOT COW, AS ANNOUNCED IN THE TEMPLE. COWS ARE A MANIFESTATION OF THE DIVINE IN HINDUISM. KILLING OR EATING ITS FLESH IS DEEMED SINFUL. PEOPLE FROM THE BRAHMIN CASTE AVOID EITHER. ONLY DALITS (OUTCASTES), WHO ARE CONSIDERED IMPURE AND UNTOUCHABLES, CAN TOUCH THE ANIMAL, EAT ITS MEAT AND WORK THE LEATHER. RECENTLY, THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA, WHICH IS ALSO RUN BY A BJP ADMINISTRATION, BANNED THE SALE OF BEEF, AND IN RECENT DAYS A HINDU NATIONALIST LEADER OF THE STATE OF JHARKHAND HAS THREATENED NEW ATTACKS AGAINST MINORITIES, ESPECIALLY CHRISTIANS, IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT IMPLEMENT THE TOTAL BAN OF LIVESTOCK. BOTH STATES ARE LED BY HINDU NATIONALISTS OF THE BJP (BHARATIYA JANATA PARTY, IN POWER THROUGHOUT THE UNION WITH MODI). KIRAN S, SUPERINTENDENT OF THE LOCAL POLICE IN THE DISTRICT OF GAUTAM BUDDH NAGAR, SAYS: "THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE TOOK THE MICROPHONE IN THE LOCAL TEMPLE OF BISARA

216	NORTH CARROLL HIGH SCHOOL HONORED ED POWELSON SIX YEARS AGO BY NAMING ITS STADIUM FIELD AFTER THE MAN WHO DEVOTED ALMOST ALL OF HIS ADULT LIFE TO HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS IN HAMPSTEAD, AND SEVERAL COUNTY SPORTS FIGURES ATTENDED THE CEREMONY. ONE OF THEM WAS GEORGE WUNDER, A 1992 NORTH CARROLL GRAD AND LONGTIME BASKETBALL COACH AT CENTURY HIGH. HE WANTED THE PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE TO KNOW HOW MUCH POWELSON IMPACTED HIS LIFE, AND MANY OTHERS, AS A COACH, ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, AND ROLE MODEL. "NO ONE EVER CARED ABOUT NORTH CARROLL MORE," WUNDER SAID THAT DAY, "THAN MR. POWELSON." LRELATED WESTMINSTERASCENSION EPISCOPAL CHURCH HOLDS BLESSING OF THE ANIMALSSEE ALL RELATED 8 POWELSON, ONE OF CARROLL COUNTY'S MORE RECOGNIZABLE SPORTS FIGURES, DIED SUNDAY AFTER A LONG BATTLE WITH CANCER. HE WAS 77. POWELSON COACHED BOYS SOCCER AT NORTH CARROLL FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS AND FINISHED HIS COACHING CAREER WITH 274 WINS THE MOST IN STATE HISTORY FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL COACH WHEN HE RETIRED IN 1995 TO GO WITH 46 COMBINED COUNTY, CONFERENCE AND REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS. HE WAS INDUCTED INTO THE CARROLL COUNTY SPORTS HALL OF FAME IN 2001, AND LATER THIS WEEK NORTH CARROLL WILL BEGIN ITS SEVENTH FALL SPORTS SEASON WITH GAMES PLAYED ON POWELSON FIELD. CCOMMENTS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY? START THE CONVERSATION AND BE THE FIRST TO COMMENT. ADD A COMMENT 0 TROY WAREHIME, NORTH CARROLL'S ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, SPOKE DURING A CEREMONY IN 2006 WHEN POWELSON BECAME THE FIRST MEMBER OF NC'S SPORTS HALL OF FAME. THREE YEARS LATER, HE SPOKE AGAIN AT THE POWELSON FIELD DEDICATION CEREMONY. WAREHIME IS PLANNING TO SAY SOME WORDS ABOUT POWELSON LATER THIS WEEK AT ONE OF POWELSON'S MEMORIAL SERVICES. "THIS TIME WON'T BE SO EASY," WAREHIME SAID. "HE WAS MY HERO." POWELSON HAILED FROM RIDGELEY, WEST VIRGINIA, GRADUATED FROM FAIRMONT STATE COLLEGE IN 1959, AND CAME TO CARROLL COUNTY IN 1961, WHEN HE TOOK A JOB TEACHING PHYSICAL EDUCATION AT HAMPSTEAD ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS. HE DECLINED AN OFFER TO BECOME A PE TEACHER AT NORTH CARROLL HIGH THE FOLLOWING YEAR. WHEN IT WAS OFFERED AGAIN THE NEXT YEAR, HE ACCEPTED. "I FIGURED THEY WOULDN'T ASK THREE TIMES," POWELSON SAID IN A 1997 TIMES ARTICLE. POWELSON COACHED TRACK AND FIELD, BASKETBALL, AND SOCCER TO START, THEN ADDED GYMNASTICS TO HIS RESUME. HE ALSO INHERITED ATHLETIC DIRECTOR DUTIES, EVEN THOUGH SUCH A POSITION DIDN'T REALLY EXIST BACK THEN. "I WAS THE ONLY COACH," POWELSON SAID IN THE 1997 ARTICLE. "AND YOU DID ALL THE SCHEDULING, YOU DID EVERYTHING, EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T CALLED ATHLETIC DIRECTORS AND WE DIDN'T GET PAID A CENT FOR ANY OF IT, WHICH WAS FINE. "THAT WASN'T A PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT WASN'T WHY YOU GET IN TEACHING OR COACHING. YOU WERE IN IT FOR THE LOVE OF IT." POWELSON'S BOYS SOCCER TEAMS WON 20 COUNTY TITLES BETWEEN 1961 AND 1988 AND ENJOYED A 46-GAME WINNING STREAK. HE STEPPED AWAY FROM COACHING IN 1995, AND LEFT HIS POST AS ATHLETIC DIRECTOR IN 1997, WRAPPING UP A TEACHING AND COACHING CAREER THAT SPANNED FOUR DECADES. "HE TAUGHT KIDS, HE TAUGHT THEIR PARENTS, AND HE MIGHT HAVE TAUGHT A FEW OF THEIR GRANDPARENTS," WAREHIME SAID. POWELSON HELPED INTRODUCE THE ATHLETIC TRAINER PROGRAM TO CARROLL IN THE 1980S; HE HELPED FORM THE MONOCACY VALLEY ATHLETIC LEAGUE IN 1972 AND THE CENTRAL MARYLAND CONFERENCE IN THE '80S; AND HE WAS INDUCTED INTO THE MARYLAND STATE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR HALL OF FAME IN 1998. "THEY SORT OF BROKE THE MOLD WITH ED," SAID JIM RODRIGUEZ, CARROLL'S SUPERVISOR OF ATHLETICS, AT THE 2009 FIELD-NAMING CEREMONY. "IT'S ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE HE TOUCHED AND THE LIFE LESSONS HE GAVE THEM BEYOND THE FIELD." WHEN NORTH CARROLL'S FOOTBALL TEAM HAD THE FIRST HOME PLAYOFF CONTEST IN ITS HISTORY LAST FALL, POWELSON WAS ON HAND TO TAKE PART IN THE PRE-GAME COIN FLIP. HE WAS ALREADY INTO HIS FIGHT AGAINST PROSTATE CANCER AT THE TIME, BUT POWELSON RARELY MISSED A SPORTING EVENT AT EITHER NORTH CARROLL OR MANCHESTER VALLEY. HIS DAUGHTER, DENEAN KOONTZ, IS NORTH CARROLL'S FIELD HOCKEY COACH. HIS SON-IN-LAW, BERNIE KOONTZ, COACHES BASKETBALL AT MANCHESTER VALLEY. DENEAN KOONTZ SAID IT SERVED HER FATHER WELL DURING A DIFFICULT TIME BEING ABLE TO WATCH THE PANTHERS' FIELD HOCKEY TEAM WIN THE LAST TWO CLASS 1A STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS, WITH HIS GRANDDAUGHTER JENSYN KOONTZ AS A STANDOUT. "HE DOESN'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY," DENEAN KOONTZ SAID. "HE KEPT FIGHTING UNTIL THE DAY HE PASSED AWAY. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO MY FATHER ... WAS HIS FAMILY. FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THE PAST [FEW] YEARS WITH THEM, AND TO SEE ALL OF THOSE THINGS, WAS VERY, VERY SPECIAL."

217	VOA - NEWS MONDAY 28TH SEPTEMBER, 2015 KENYAN PRESIDENT UHURU KENYATTA SAYS EAST AFRICAN NATIONS THAT HAVE WORKED TO BRING A NEW PEACE AGREEMENT FOR SOUTH SUDAN SHOULD EXPAND THEIR EFFORTS TO INCLUDE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN IMPLEMENTING THE PACT TO END 20 MONTHS OF FIGHTING. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH VOA'S AFRICA 54 IN NEW YORK, KENYATTA SAID THAT PATH WILL ALLOW THE OPENING OF HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS IN SOUTH SUDAN, WHERE THE CONFLICT HAS FORCED 2 MILLION PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES. IT WILL ALSO HELP IN ESTABLISHING AN AGREED UPON UNITY GOVERNMENT BETWEEN THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION AND REBELS. "I THINK THE KEY FOCUS NOW IS ACTUALLY ON IMPLEMENTATION, AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT ALL PARTIES HAVE SIGNED, I BELIEVE THERE IS A KEEN COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF ALL SOUTH SUDANESE PARTIES TO SEE A GENUINE PEACE ACHIEVED," KENYATTA SAID. "AND WHAT THEY NEED FROM US IS REALLY THE BACKING TO SEE THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH." KENYATTA EXPRESSED THE NEED TO INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT AND REBELS IN THE PROCESS, BUT ALSO TO BRING IN CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATION, CHURCHES AND THE COMMUNITIES OF SOUTH SUDAN. THE PEACE DEAL AGREED TO LAST MONTH CALLS FOR DEMILITARIZING THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL, JUBA, FORMING A TRANSITIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT WITHIN 90 DAYS AND GIVING REBELS THE POSITION OF VICE PRESIDENT. SINCE THE SIGNING, BOTH SIDES HAVE VIOLATED A CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT. IMPLEMENTING THE PEACE DEAL WILL BE THE FOCUS OF A MEETING TUESDAY ON THE SIDELINES OF THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN NEW YORK. THE TALKS WILL INCLUDE U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL BAN KI-MOON, AFRICAN UNION CHAIR NKOSAZANA DLAMINI ZUMA AND THE REGIONAL BODY IGAD THAT HELPED MEDIATE THE AGREEMENT. SOUTH SUDAN PRESIDENT SALVA KIIR IS SENDING VICE PRESIDENT JAMES WANI IGGA TO REPRESENT THE GOVERNMENT; IT IS NOT CLEAR IF REBEL LEADER AND FORMER VICE PRESIDENT RIEK MACHAR WILL PARTICIPATE. IN ADDITION TO THE SITUATION IN SOUTH SUDAN, KENYATTA TOLD AFRICA 54 THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS "GREATLY INCREASING" INVESTMENT IN SECURITY AFTER WHAT HE SAID WAS YEARS OF NOT SPENDING ENOUGH RESOURCES IN THAT SECTOR. HE SAID THE ISSUE IS NOT ONE THAT IS UNIQUE TO KENYA AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT IS PROMOTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO "DENY SOME OF THESE EXTREMISTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A PULL FOR THESE TERRORISTS." "AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THIS THREAT OF TERRORISM IS NOT A THREAT TO KENYA, IT'S A THREAT TO THE WORLD, AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DEFEAT IT," HE SAID. KENYATTA ALSO DISCUSSED THE SCHEDULED NOVEMBER VISIT OF POPE FRANCIS, CALLING IT A "SIGNIFICANT MOMENT FOR KENYA." "WE ARE VERY EXCITED, BESIDE THE FACT THAT I'M A CATHOLIC, BUT I THINK HE IS REACHING OUT TO ALL RELIGIONS AND REACHING OUT TO ALL PEOPLE, AND HE HAS A VERY HUMANE MESSAGE THAT HE IS SENDING WHICH I THINK IS VERY APPROPRIATE NOT JUST FOR KENYA, BUT FOR THE WORLD TODAY," KENYATTA SAID.
218	THE NFL UPGRADED THE COACH-TO-PLAYER COMMUNICATION SYSTEM THREE YEARS AGO AND NOW ITS APPARENT THE COACH-TO-COACH HEADSETS ARE DUE FOR AN UPGRADE, TOO. FOLLOWING PITTSBURGHS 28-21 LOSS AT NEW ENGLAND IN THE 2015 OPENER, STEELERS COACH MIKE TOMLIN COMPLAINED ABOUT HEADSET FAILURES, WHICH HE CHARGED ARE ALWAYS THE CASE WHEN PLAYING IN NEW ENGLAND. THE STEELERS SAID FRIDAY THEY DONT PLAN TO FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT AND THE LEAGUE SAID THE PATRIOTS DID NOTHING WRONG. BUT THE PATRIOTS ARE UNDER SCRUTINY AFTER THE TEAM ACCEPTED PUNISHMENT FOR USING DEFLATED FOOTBALLS AND TOM BRADY FOUGHT HIS SUSPENSION. LAST DECADE, THE PATRIOTS WERE PUNISHED FOR VIDEOTAPING THE HAND SIGNALS OF OPPOSING COACHES. NFL VICE PRESIDENT OF FOOTBALL COMMUNICATIONS MICHAEL SIGNORA SAID THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT FALLS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE LEAGUE, AND THAT THE HEADSET PROBLEMS WERE A FUNCTION OF A POWER ISSUE AT THE STADIUM THAT WAS MADE WORSE BY FOUL WEATHER BUT WAS FIXED DURING THE GAME. THE LEAGUE ADDED FRIDAY THAT IT INVOLVED NO MANIPULATION BY ANY INDIVIDUAL; AND THAT THE PATRIOTS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THE ISSUE WAS PROMPTLY RESOLVED AND THERE WERE NO FURTHER PROBLEMS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE GAME. WE WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE MATTER TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE TECHNICAL STEPS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO AVOID SIMILAR PROBLEMS FROM OCCURRING IN OTHER GAMES. PLAYERS AND COACHES SAY HEADSETS USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH QUARTERBACKS AND DESIGNATED DEFENDERS ON THE FIELD HAVE BECOME MORE RELIABLE IN RECENT SEASONS AFTER THE LEAGUE SWITCHED FROM THE OUTDATED ANALOG COMMUNICATION SYSTEM TO A DIGITAL NETWORK IN 2012, BUT PROBLEMS PERSIST IN THE COACH-TO-COACH CHANNELS. SOMETIMES, THEY HEAR STATIC, CROSSED SIGNALS, NOISES THAT ARENT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE LIKE THE PATRIOTS RADIO BROADCAST THAT TOMLIN SAID HE AND HIS STAFF HAD TO LISTEN TO ON THEIR HEADSETS IN THE FIRST HALF THURSDAY NIGHT. WITH RADIO FREQUENCIES, THERES MILLIONS OF FACTORS THAT COME INTO PLAY, SO I COULDNT TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THERE, SAID ALEX SHADA, DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS FOR GUBSER & SCHNAKENBERG LLC, THE LINCOLN, NEBRASKA-BASED PROVIDER OF COACH-TO-PLAYER COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS FOR THE NFL. GUBSER & SCHNAKENBERG ONLY PROVIDES THE COACH-TO-PLAYER SYSTEM; THE COACH-TO-COACH SYSTEMS ARENT AS SECURE AND ARE OPEN TO MORE INTERFERENCE, TEAMS SAY. ITS RARE THAT IVE GONE THROUGH AN NFL GAME THAT THERE WAS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE HEADSET, BROWNS COACH MIKE PETTINE SAID, NOTING THERES OFTEN DEAD ZONES IN CERTAIN SPOTS ON THE SIDELINE. PETTINE SAID THE COACH-TO-COACH COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WOULD SOON BE UPGRADED. THE SYSTEM THAT WERE USING, ITS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ITS GOING TO BE REPLACED. THAT, TO ME, HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS, PETTINE SAID. WEVE TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE OFFSEASON. WERE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS SEASON WITH WHAT WE HAVE AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH IT. COACHES AND COORDINATORS BEGAN TALKING TO QUARTERBACKS WITH RADIOS IN 1994 AND MISCOMMUNICATIONS AND MISHAPS WERE AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD WITH HOT DOG VENDORS, MUSICIANS, AND TRUCKERS HAVE SOMEHOW ENDING UP ON TEAM RADIOS UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THINGS GOT MUCH, MUCH BETTER. THE DIGITAL SYSTEM IS EASIER TO USE. THERES NO LONGER A DELAY PRECEDED BY A BEEP TO WAIT FOR THE FREQUENCY TO CLEAR. INSTEAD, COACHES NOW PUSH A BUTTON AND CAN TALK INSTANTLY AND WITH CLEARER SOUND. THE HELMETS ARE EQUIPPED ONLY WITH A SPEAKER, NOT A MICROPHONE. SO, THE PLAYER CANNOT TALK BACK TO THE COACH. EACH TEAM IS ONLY ALLOWED ONE LIVE HELMET, DESIGNATED BY A SMALL GREEN DOT ON THE BACK, ON THE FIELD AT A TIME. ONCE THE 40-SECOND PLAY CLOCK BEGINS, COACHES HAVE 25 SECONDS TO MAKE A CALL AND PASS ON INFORMATION. THE MICROPHONES FOR ALL THE RADIO TRANSMITTERS SHUT OFF AUTOMATICALLY AT THE 15-SECOND MARK, SO THE COACHES CANT GIVE LIVE ADVICE DURING A PLAY. A LEAGUE OFFICIAL IS ON SITE TO MONITOR. THE NFL HAS SAID MILITARY-GRADE ENCRYPTION CODES PROTECT THE FREQUENCIES. OBVIOUSLY, SIGNALS STILL GET CROSSED IN THE COACH-TO-COACH COMMUNICATIONS THOUGH. ITS JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE YOUVE GOT TO WORK THROUGH ON GAME DAY, LIKE AN INJURY OR SOMETHING, BRONCOS COACH GARY KUBIAK SAID. YOUVE GOT TO BATTLE YOUR WAY THROUGH IT.

IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE FOR THE FINEST MEMOIRS/AUTOBIOGRAPHIES I'VE READ BY INDIANS-WHETHER KHUSHWANT SINGH'S TRUTH, LOVE & A LITTLE MALICE, VINOD MEHTA'S LUCKNOW BOY, AND SINCE WE'RE TALKING FILMS, NASEERUDDIN SHAH'S AND THEN ONE DAY. THE LATEST V. SHANTARAM BOOK IS OF COURSE NOT AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY. THIS IS HIS DAUGHTER MADHURA PANDIT JASRAJ'S ATTEMPT AT RE-ENCAPSULATING HER FATHER'S CAREER. MUCH BEFORE THE STAR SYSTEM IN INDIAN CINEMA, THERE USED TO BE THE STUDIO SYSTEM. THE UNPAID OFFICE INTERN (SUCH AS YOUNG S.R. VANKUDRE IN THE PIONEER BABURAO PAINTER'S MAHARASHTRA FILM COMPANY IN KOLHAPUR) COULD WELL BE THE LEAD ACTOR. WHICH IS HOW VANKUDRE (WHO LATER NAMED HIMSELF V. SHANTARAM) MADE HIS SCREEN DEBUT IN 1921, WITH THE SILENT MOVIE SUREKHA HARAN, A MYTHOLOGICAL FILM, OBVIOUSLY. THERE IS OF COURSE MUCH IN SHANTARAM'S EARLY LIFE AND CAREER TO MARVEL AT. HIS FIRST JOB WAS AS A MANUAL LABOURER IN THE RAILWAYS. HE WENT ON TO ACT/DIRECT/PRODUCE 81 FILMS, BESIDES FOUNDING TWO STUDIOS-PRABHAT AND RAJKAMAL. WE'RE LOOKING AT A BOY WHO JOINED THE MOVIE INDUSTRY IN 1920 AND REMAINED ASSOCIATED WITH IT UNTIL HE DIED IN 1990. THAT IS SEVEN YEARS SHORT OF THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF INDIAN CINEMA-FROM SILENT TO TALKIE TO COLOUR TO TV. YOU WISH TO GET A SENSE OF THE CHANGING WORLD AROUND SHANTARAM-FILMS INCLUDED. THERE IS LITTLE OF THAT IN THE BOOK. ON THE PERSONAL FRONT, THE PORTRAIT THAT EMERGES OF SHANTARAM IS OF A MAN OBSESSED WITH HIS WORK, YES; BUT OF AN ASEXUAL FILMMAKER REPEATEDLY SPURRING ADVANCES FROM HIS EVER-WILLING HEROINES. AS A STUDIO BOSS, HE SEEMS WHOLLY SELFLESS, DOING EVERYTHING TO KEEP THE FLOCK TOGETHER, WHILE HIS JEALOUS, CONNIVING PARTNERS GANG UP TO DISLODGE HIM FROM THE PUNE-BASED PRABHAT FILM COMPANY. MIHIR BOSE'S SEMINAL WORK BOLLYWOOD: A HISTORY CITES SHANTARAM'S SON KIRAN'S BIOGRAPHY TO SUGGEST THAT THE REASON HIS PARTNERS DESERTED HIM WAS BECAUSE SHANTARAM HAD BROKEN A CARDINAL RULE: FALLEN FOR AN EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY, A MUCH YOUNGER ACTOR JAYASHREE WHOM HE MARRIED LATER. MADHURA IS SHANTARAM'S DAUGHTER FROM HIS FIRST WIFE VIMAL. SHANTARAM BOUNCED BACK WITH A NEW STUDIO, RAJKAMAL, HAVING MOVED TO BOMBAY. BY THE TIME THE FIRST RAJKAMAL FILM WAS READY (IN THE LATTER HALF OF 1943), WE'RE TOLD, HE HAD BECOME FATHER OF TWO MORE CHILDREN-CHARUSHEELA (HIS DAUGHTER FROM VIMAL), AND KIRAN, THE BIOGRAPHER (HIS SON FROM JAYASHREE). POLYGAMY MAY HAVE BEEN CULTURALLY ACCEPTABLE THEN. INTRICACIES OF SUCH A RELATIONSHIP INSPIRE MUCH CURIOSITY NOW. MADHURA, THE INSIDER, DWELLS NO FURTHER ON THIS POLITICS, STICKING TO HER FATHER'S PROFESSIONAL CV. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE BOOK'S TITLE: THE MAN WHO CHANGED INDIAN CINEMA. WAS SHANTARAM THAT MAN? IN THE EARLY YEARS OF TALKIES, MOVIES MAINLY MEANT 'HISTORICALS'/'MYTHOLOGICALS' LADEN WITH SONGS. DUNIYA NA MANE (1937; A FILM ON CHILD MARRIAGE) ONWARDS, SHANTARAM DID PROVE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MAKE FILMS ON SENSITIVE, SENSIBLE, SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS SUBJECTS THAT WERE ALSO COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. SHANTARAM DISPLAYED STAGGERING RANGE-HIS DO ANKHEN BARAH HAATH (1957, ON PRISON REFORMS) PICKED UP BOTH THE GOLDEN BEAR AT BERLIN AND A GOLDEN GLOBE, AND REMAINS FRESH IN PUBLIC MEMORY STILL. BESIDES BEING A PROGRESSIVE FILMMAKER, SHANTARAM WAS AN INSTITUTION BUILDER, WHICH TRULY EXPLAINS THE SIZE OF HIS CONTRIBUTION. HE ALSO INTRODUCED A POSSE OF TALENTS OVER SIX DECADES. THE CURRENT GENERATION WILL STILL KNOW MUMTAZ AND JEETENDRA FROM THIS BOOK. AND YEAH, HE WAS A WONDERFUL FAMILY MAN. MADHURA'S WARM LOVE LETTER TO HER DECEASED FATHER IS TESTIMONY TO THAT, EVEN IF IT FEELS LIKE A SERIES OF WIKIPEDIA ENTRIES. TO USE THE MOST TERRIBLE FILM REVIEWING CLICH, SINCE THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT FILMS: IT'S REALLY LONG; BUT YOU MUST READ IT, IF YOU'RE A SHANTARAM FAN! WELL. MAYANK SHEKHAR IS A FILM CRITIC AND RUNS THEW14.COM
221	THE ISSUE: THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE BY THE END OF THE MONTH WHETHER IT WILL PUT THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST. WE BELIEVE: FISH AND WILDLIFE SHOULD HOLD OFF AND LET CURRENT CONSERVATION EFFORTS WORK. WE DO THINK THE AGENCY SHOULD MAINTAIN ITS THREAT AS A MEANS TO KEEP THOSE PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD. TELL US WHAT YOU THINK: CONTACT US VIA EMAIL AT OPINION@WYOMINGNEWS.COM . IT IS BEING CALLED "THE LARGEST CONSERVATION EFFORT EVER UNDERTAKEN." AND IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. BUT SUPPORTERS OF THE 11-STATE EFFORT TO SAVE THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE SAY THEY WILL LOSE MUCH OF THEIR MOMENTUM - AND PERHAPS THE BIRD ITSELF - IF THE U.S.  THANKS.' THE POST SPARKED A FLURRY OF COMMENS WITH SARAH TURNER, WHO RUNS THE UNMUMSY MUM, TAGGING GARY BARLOW IN THE POST. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE LISTS IT AS ENDANGERED LATER THIS MONTH. WE AGREE. IN TRUTH, JUST THE THREAT OF THAT LISTING HAS DRIVEN A BROAD COALITION OF STATE AGENCIES, PRIVATE INDUSTRY, LANDOWNERS AND NONPROFIT GROUPS TO COMMENDABLY JOIN HANDS, MAKE COMPROMISES AND SET IN PLACE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS TO SAVE THE GROUSE. TAKE THAT THREAT AWAY, OR PUT THE AUTHORITY FOR CONTROLLING THE PROCESS INTO FEDERAL HANDS - AND PERHAPS COMPLICATE AND OVER-REGULATE THE EFFORT -  AND MANY OF THEM SIMPLY WILL WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE. AT STAKE IN THIS DISCUSSION IS A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY DEVELOPED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENTS OF INTERIOR AND AGRICULTURE TO MANAGE THE GROUSE ON BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT AND FOREST SERVICE LAND. IT INCORPORATES TE BATTLE PLANS DEVELOPED SEPARATELY IN RECENT YEARS BY THE 11 STATES - STRETCHING FROM WYOMING TO CALIFORNIA AND NORTHWARD TO THE CANADIAN BORDER - IN THE BIRDS' RANGE. (WYOMING HAS BEEN AMONG THE LEADERS IN THE PROCESS, MAINLY BECAUSE MOST OF THE BIRDS RESIDE WITHIN ITS BORDERS. A FEDERAL LISTING COULD HAVE DEVASTATING ONSEQUENCES HERE, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF RESTRICTING THE ESSENTIAL ENERGY INDUSTRY.) THE GOAL OF THE BLM EFFORT IS TO SAVE THE BIRD BY PROTECTING AND BUILDING UP ITS SAGEBRUSH HABITAT. ITS RANGE HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM 500,000 TO 250,000 SQUARE MILES, AND ITS NUMBERS HAVE DROPPED FROM 16 MILLION, BY SOME ESTIMATES, TO ABOUT 400,000. AND SCIENTISTS BELIEVE ITS NUMBERS CONTINUE TO DIP. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE PLANS SET ASIDE "CORE AREAS," WHERE DEVELOPMENT IS NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE OR WHERE WORK STOPPAGES OCCUR AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR, SUCH AS IN MATING SEASON. OTHER EFFORTS ALSO ARE MADE TO PROTECT THE GROUSE IN THESE ESSENTIAL AREAS, SUCH AS DISCOURAGING WIND DEVELOPMENT OR BANNING OIL AND GAS PIPELINES AND TRANSMISSION LINES. BUT THERE ARE OTHER BENEFITS FROM THESE EFFORTS. THE GROUSE IS AN "UMBRELLA SPECIES." THAT MEANS IT SHARES ITS HABITAT WITH SOME 350 OTHER SPECIES, SEVERAL OF WHICH ALSO MAY BE HEADED FOR LISTING BY THE FEDS. BOOSTING THE GROUSE'S HABITAT HELPS THEM AS WELL. ONE BENEFICIARY OF IMPROVED SAGEBRUSH THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO WYOMINGITES' HEARTS IS THE MULE DEER, WHICH WINTERS THERE. THE DEER'S NUMBERS ALSO ARE ON THE DECLINE IN THE COWBOY STATE.  THE AGENCY SHOULD MAINTAIN THE THREAT OF LISTING, PERHAPS CREATING TIMELINES FOR REVIEWING OUTCOMES, IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM MOVING FORWARD.  THREE CEDARS CONSISTS OF THREE SITES LOCATED IN IRON COUNTY, UTAH . BUT IF THE PLANS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THIS ACTUALLY COULD SET A NEW DIRECTION FOR WORKING WITH THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT, RATHER THAN ALL SIDES ACTING AS ADVERSARIES. ADDITIONALLY, THIS NEWSPAPER URGES WYOMING'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO BACK OFF OF ITS EFFORTS TO FORESTALL FEDERAL SAGE GROUSE ACTION THROUGH LEGISLATION. THAT MIGHT DELAY A LISTING, BUT IT ALSO COULD IMPLODE THESE COALITIONS BY REMOVING THEIR INCENTIVE TO WORK FOR THE BIRD AND FOR THEIR STATES. AND WITHOUT THESE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS, THE GROUSE THEN COULD END UP IN A WORSE PLACE AFTER A FEDERAL MORATORIUM, SINCE EFFORTS TO BUILD THEIR HABITAT WOULD HAVE FALTERED. AND THAT WOULD VIRTUALLY GUARANTEE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING DOWN THE ROAD. WE ENCOURAGE BOTH CONGRESS AND THE U.S.  CONSTRUCTION PROFESSIONALS CAN FOLLOW CONSTRUCTION NEWS VIA TWITTER (TWITTER.COM/4CONSTRUCTNPROS; TWITTER.COM/EQUIPMENTTODAY) AND FACEBOOK (FACEBOOK.COM/FORCONSTRUCTIONPROS; FACEBOOK.COM/EQUIPMENTTODAY). FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE TO LET THIS INNOVATIVE CONSERVATION EFFORT WORK. IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO WASTE THE TIME AND MONEY SPENT ALREADY TO SAVE THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE WHEN IT VERY WELL COULD YIELD REAL FRUIT IN THE YEARS AHEAD.

222	DESPITE ASSURANCES FROM THE FRANCOPHONE NORTHEAST SCHOOL DISTRICT, A CUSTODIAN EMPLOYED THERE IS WORRIED ABOUT ASBESTOS HARMING CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL WHERE HE WORKS. RAYMOND BASKIN HAS BEEN WORKING AT COLE LA RIVIRE FOR 30 YEARS AND NOW SUFFERS FROM PULMONARY FIBROSIS, A CONDITION WORKSAFENB HAS ACCEPTED AS BEING CONNECTED TO ASBESTOS IN THE BUILDING. THE SCHOOL HAD ASBESTOS CLEANED UP IN 2014. AIR QUALITY TESTING IS NOW ON-GOING, ACCORDING TO ELOI DOUCET, DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION WITH THE DISTRICT. BEING DONE TWO WEEKS AGO, IN REGARDS TO THE PRESENCE BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE PERSONNEL. WE DID SOME TESTING AND EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL UNDER THE NORM BY HEALTH AND SAFETY, HEALTH CANADA," HE SAID. "IN LA RIVIRE, IT WAS FOUND AT A VERY MINIMAL LEVEL," SAID DOUCET. CBC NEWS ASKED FOR THE TESTING RESULTS BUT THE DISTRICT WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THEM FRIDAY. BASKIN SAYS HE HAS SEEN THE TESTING GOING ON, BUT STILL WORRIES. "THE KIDS, I MEAN, THEY'RE A LOT YOUNGER THAN WE ARE WITH SMALLER LUNGS AND ALL THIS AND ANY LITTLE THING IN THE SCHOOL, THEY'RE INHALING IT. IF THERE'S ANY DUST OR PARTICLES, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THE KIDS ARE AT RISK TOO," HE SAYS. DOUCET SAYS VISUAL INSPECTIONS OF POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS AREAS ARE DONE ONCE A YEAR. "ONCE A YEAR, EVERY FEBRUARY, NOTICE IS BEING SENT TO PEOPLE IN OUR BUILDING DEPARTMENT TO CHECK ASBESTOS, THE SITUATION OF THE ASBESTOS THERE, AND TO GIVE US A REPORT AND FROM THERE WE DO AN ARRANGEMENT. WHEN THERE'S THINGS TO BE ARRANGED OR FIXED, THAT'S WHAT'S BEING DONE ANNUALLY," HE SAID. IT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY BASKIN, WHO NOW USES A MACHINE TO HELP CLEAR HIS LUNGS. HE SAYS JUST THIS SUMMER A SCHOOL IN TRACADIE BEACH, LA VILLA DES AMIS, WAS EVACUATED AFTER A CONTRACTOR WORKING ON THE HOT WATER TANK FOUND ASBESTOS. ELOI DOUCET SAYS THE ASBESTOS WAS CLEANED THERE TOO. CLASS IS NOW IN SESSION, AND THE SCHOOL IS SAFE, HE SAYS. "THE SCHOOL WAS TESTED AFTER THE REMOVAL WAS DONE. EVERYTHING IS UNDER THE NORM," SAYS DOUCET.

227	UPDATE -- MICHAEL TOTH, PRESIDENT OF THE ONTARIO MEDICAL ASSOCIATION , SAYS THE PROFESSION IS FRUSTRATED AND SOME MEMBERS ARE TALKING ABOUT LEAVING THE PROVINCE OR RETIRING EARLY. "IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PATIENTS ULTIMATELY," HE WARNED, NOTING THAT SOME PHYSICIANS WILL BE FORCED TO LAY OFF STAFF AND CUT OFFICE BUDGETS. PHYSICIANS ARE VENTING THEIR ANGER ON SOCIAL MEDIA.  THE NSW SENATOR BECOMES AUSTRALIAS SEVENTH DEFENCE MINISTER IN ALMOST A DECADE, AND THE THIRD IN LESS THAN 12 MONTHS. ON TWITTER , HARDLINERS ARE THREATENING JOB ACTION SUCH AS A WORK-TO-RULE CAMPAIGN, HOUR CUTBACKS AND CANCELLATION OF FLU-SHOT CLINICS. TOTH SAID THE OMA, WHICH REPRESENTS 28,000 MEMBERS, WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH GOVERNMENT AND IS CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION. HEALTH MINISTER ERIC HOSKINS SAID HE WANTS TO REASSURE ONTARIANS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERVICE CUTS. "MY CONCERN IS THAT A PERCEPTION IS BEING PROPAGATED THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE CHALLENGING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE FACTS SIMPLY DON'T BEAR THIS OUT," HE SAID. ONTARIO DOCTORS ARE AMONG THE BEST PAID IN CANADA WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF ABOUT $350,000, AN AMOUNT THAT HAS GROWN BY 60 PER CENT OVER THAT LAST DECADE, HOSKINS SAID.  ON HIS PART, OTIOTIO SAID HIS DECISION TO JOIN THE RACE WAS TAKEN BECAUSE HE WAS PREPARED FOR THE JOB AND THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE DESERVE A LEADER LIKE HIM WHO WILL BRING TO BEAR INTEGRITY IN RUNNING THE AFFAIRS OF THE STATE. FROM THAT, PHYSICIANS PAY OVERHEAD COSTS, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE WAGES AND OFFICE RENT, AN AMOUNT WIDELY QUOTED AS ABOUT 30 PER CENT. HOSKINS SAID PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED OVER WHAT IS A DISPUTE OVER REMUNERATION: "I HAVE RECEIVED ASSURANCE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE OMA THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE ACTION THAT WILL IMPACT THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY PROVIDE OR PATIENT SAFETY.  IM THINKING EIGHT YEARS AGO.  THE LITTLE BIRDIE IS FROM THE GARDEN WHIMSY STAMP SET. I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD." THE RIFT DATES BACK TO A PAYMENT SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT UNILATERALLY IMPOSED LAST JANUARY AFTER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OMA ENDED IN AN IMPASSE. IT INCLUDED A 2.65 PER CENT FEE CUT AND A CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IF DOCTORS' OHIP BILLINGS WERE TAKING DOCTORS OVER THEIR $11.6-ALLOTMENT.  THE DISCOVERY ART SHOW IS AN EXHIBITION CREATED BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, SO FOR PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC, THE COMMUNITY, LLOYDMINSTER AND AREA, THAT WILL BE ON DISPLAY DURING CULTURE DAYS, AND WILL BE A CELEBRATION OF LOCAL ART AND CREATIVITY, LANCASTER SAID. THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENT MODEL ALLOWS DOCTORS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPENSATION. IF THEY SEE MORE PATIENTS AND PERFORM MORE PROCEDURES, THEY CAN BILL THE PUBLIC INSURANCE PLAN FOR MORE MONEY.  THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE ANNUAL INCREASES ARE INTENDED TO MEET A RISE IN DEMAND FROM A GROWING AND AGING POPULATION AND THE ADDITION OF 700 NEW DOCTORS. BUT THE OMA CONTENDS INCREASES OF 2.7 PER CENT ARE NEEDED IN EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND GROWTH. THE OMA IS LOBBYING MPPS, HOLDING TOWN HALL MEETINGS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE PROVINCE AND STAGING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH MEMBERS NEXT WEEK. TOTH ARGUED THERE IS A "POWER IMBALANCE" WITH GOVERNMENT AND CALLED FOR A NEUTRAL THIRD-PARTY TO WEIGH IN WITH A BINDING DECISION: "WE ARE LOOKING TO RESOLVE THIS ... WE THINK THE WAY TO DO THIS IS MEDIATION-ARBITRATION." ONTARIO DOCTORS WARN THAT PATIENTS WILL HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CUTTING THEIR FEES. THE GOVERNMENT IS CHOPPING FEES BY 1.3 PER CENT STARTING NEXT WEEK TO KEEP THE PROFESSION WITHIN AN ALLOTTED $11.6-BILLION BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. DR.

229	SAN PEDRO >> EVEN WITH THE RETURN OF STARTING QUARTERBACK JACOB MILLER, SAN PEDRO DID WHAT IT DOES BEST: RUN THE FOOTBALL. CULVER CITY HAD NO ANSWER FOR THE PIRATES GROUND GAME AND SAN PEDRO PULLED AWAY FROM THE CENTAURS LATE IN A 44-33 VICTORY. MILLER GOT THE PIRATES (2-2) ROLLING IN THE FIRST QUARTER BY THROWING DEEP AND FINDING RECEIVER RAYMOND GEHA IN THE END ZONE FOR A 37-YARD TOUCHDOWN. HOWEVER, THE RUNNING BACKS TOOK OVER AFTER THAT AND SCORED FOUR RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS COMBINED. KAI KANESHIRO LED THE WAY FOR SAN PEDRO WITH 124 RUSHING YARDS ON 16 CARRIES AND SCORED TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER TO HELP THE PIRATES MAINTAIN THE LEAD. BRIAN HALSEY ALSO HAD A STRONG GAME WITH 102 RUSHING YARDS ON 17 CARRIES. ANTONIO FRAZIER FOUND A HOLE FOR A 28-YARD TOUCHDOWN IN THE SECOND QUARTER, AND SEAN DAVENPORT HAD A 24-YARD TOUCHDOWN IN THE THIRD QUARTER. HOWEVER, CULVER CITY (1-2) STAYED IN THE GAME AND TOOK A BRIEF 20-17 LEAD EARLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER AFTER QUARTERBACK JONATHAN MARTIN FOUND RECEIVER KYLE JOHNSON FOR A 5-YARD TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION. THEN IT WAS MICHAEL HERNANDEZ WHO STEPPED UP ON OFFENSE, DEFENSE AND SPECIAL TEAMS IN THE SECOND HALF. MILLER FOUND THE SPEEDY RECEIVER FOR A 31-YARD TOUCHDOWN CATCH LATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHICH GAVE SAN PEDRO THE LEAD FOR GOOD. HERNANDEZ THEN HAD AN IMPRESSIVE 80-YARD KICKOFF RETURN WHICH LED TO A 5-YARD TOUCHDOWN RUN FOR KANESHIRO AND GAVE THE PIRATES A 37-27 LEAD WITH 7:42 LEFT IN THE GAME. HERNANDEZ ALSO HAD A 40-YARD INTERCEPTION WHICH HE NEARLY RETURNED FOR A TOUCHDOWN. THAT LED TO ANOTHER SCORE FOR KANESHIRO WITH 4:33 REMAINING GIVING SAN PEDRO A COMFORTABLE 44-27 LEAD.

JANOV WRITES, THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA WHILE BEING CARRIED AND IN CHILDHOOD DIE IN AVERAGE TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THOSE RISK FACTORS. SO HERE THIS IS A GOOD ARGUMENT, FOR UNDERSTANDING AND RELIVING AND FEELING OUR PAIN, AND POSSIBLY EVEN HEALING BIG SECTIONS OF OUR HEARTS AND SOULS THAT ARE THERE WAS AN OLD BOOK THAT HE WROTE CALLED PRISONERS OF PAIN. THAT WERE ALL KIND OF HUGGED TIED BY OUR PAIN AND THE REPRESSION THAT WE USE TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT. JL: RIGHT, AND I THINK THIS CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF AFFECTS TOO IN TERMS OF HOW WE REPRESS OR HOW WE TRY TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE JUST AS BAD IF WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DIG PAST THE PAIN OR REPRESS IT THAT CREATES ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM, WHICH CAN THEN SHOW UP IN OTHER WAYS. THERE HASNT BEEN A LOT OF DEFINITIVE RESEARCH ON THIS, BUT DR. JANOV REALLY BELIEVES THAT THIS ALSO MAY BE BEHIND WHAT EVENTUALLY CAUSES CANCER, THIS SORT OF MASSIVE REPRESSION ON THE CELLULAR LEVEL THAT PREVENTS NATURAL GROWTH AND THEN OVERTIME CREATES CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES. KR: ID LIKE TO READ ANOTHER SHORT SECTION HERE, DR.  WE THEN GO ABOUT TREATING THE VARIED OFFSHOOTS FROM A CENTRAL IMPRINT, RATHER THAN THE IMPRINT ITSELF. TREATMENT BECOMES INTERMINABLE, WHAT WE GET IS A FRAGMENT OF PROGRESS, A CHANGE IN ASPECTS OF AN EARLY EXPERIENCE, RATHER THAN A HOLISTIC RECALIBRATION OR NEURO AND PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS CONNECTED WITH THE EXPERIENCE. JL: RIGHT. I THINK THATS REALLY TO KIND OF TAKE THAT AND KIND OF GO TIED IN WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYING COMPARISONS HE DRAWS IN THE BOOK TO SOMEBODY LIKE FREUD, THE RELATIONSHIP HE HAS WITH SOME OF THE EARLIER SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT PRECEDED HIM IS COMPLICATED. FREUD HE HAD THIS NOTION THAT HYSTERIA WAS ROOTED IN REPRESSED SEXUAL DESIRE AND HE OFTEN CHARTED IT IN DREAMS AND SORT OF THIS SYMBOLIC NOTION OF DREAMS. I THINK WHAT JANOV REALLY DOES IS HE TAKES, MUCH LIKE THOSE I THINK, THINKERS WHO DWELLED IN BIG IDEAS AND SORT OF PROFOUND CONCLUSIONS, HE SORT OF NOTES THAT WHILE FREUD WAS WORKING ON THE SYMBOLIC LABELS AND MISSED A LOT, HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS. INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOW THIS HYSTERIA WOULD CONSTANTLY BE UNREFLECTIVE AND PRONE TO OVERREACTION, AND JANOV WOULD SAY THAT YES THESE TRAITS EXIST, BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR SYMBOLS IN DREAMS, HELL LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF WHATS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN WERE HAVING NIGHTMARES. WHATS HAPPENING TO US BIOLOGICALLY WHEN WE HAVE A NIGHTMARE, OR WHAT DO WE FEEL DURING THAT TIME, AND WHY IS THAT TERROR COMING UP. HELL LOOK TO THE LIMBIC SYSTEM TO FIND WHERE THE TERROR IS ACTUALLY ROOTED. HES NOT TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THATS GOING TO CALM DOWN A PATIENT WHO HAS ADD OR DEPRESSION FOR THE DAY OR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. EVEN SOMETHING THAT MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO, HES REALLY LOOKING TO SOMETHING THAT CAN EVENTUALLY PROMOTE A CURE. KR: IM GOING TO READ ONE MORE PARAGRAPH OK? ON MY END DR. JANOV WRITES, THE BRAIN WE NEED TO ADDRESS DOESNT TALK, DOESNT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT DOESNT UNDERSTAND WORDS. IN FACT, THE TERM UNDERSTAND IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER, WE ARE NOT AFTER UNDERSTANDING IN THE INTELLECTUAL SENSE OF THE TERM, WE ARE AFTER INTEGRATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT CEREBRAL UNDERSTANDING.  19, 2015 /PRNEWSWIRE-IREACH/ -- AUTOCARINSURANCECHEAP.COM HAS RELEASED A NEW BLOG POST ANALYZING WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO DISCUSS INSURANCE OPTIONS WITH AN AGENT OR TO SIMPLY COMPARE ONLINE AUTO INSURANCE QUOTES . YES, UNDERSTANDING HELPS, BUT IT MUST NOT BE CONFUSED WITH RESOLVING, CONNECTING AND INTEGRATING. WHEN A THERAPIST TRIES TO GET A PATIENT TO REPORT ON HIS FEELINGS ALL MAY BE LOST, FOR THOSE FEELINGS MAY BE WORDLESS.  THE NEXT CHALLENGE OF INTEL IS TO ATTEMPT IN ENSURING THAT THE PRODUCTION OF THE CHIPS TENDS TO GO EFFORTLESSLY. TRYING TO EXPRESS THEM VERBALLY DISTANCES US FROM THE ORIGINS OF OUR PAIN IN THE LOWER BRAIN, AND SINCE ONE LAYER OF BRAIN TISSUE CANNOT DO THE WORK OF ANOTHER WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY TRUMPED OR EFFORTS, ONCE WE GET AWAY FROM WORDS WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT IS CURATIVE. UNDERSTANDING CAME LAST IN HUMAN EVOLUTION, LONG AFTER FEELING, AND IT WILL NOT LEAD US TO THE LONG TERM HEALING WE ARE AFTER.  IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, HOWEVER, MULTIPLE VIDEO CONFERENCING VENDORS HAVE ADDRESSED THE COST, FLEXIBILITY, AND BUSINESS MODELS ASSOCIATED WITH INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS. NONE OF THIS REQUIRES ABSTRACT OR ESOTERIC METHODS, WE CAN MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN SOCIETY JUST BY PAYING ATTENTION TO GESTATION AND CHANGING OUR BIRTH PRACTICES. JL: RIGHT, AND I MEAN I THINK THATS ONE OF THE BOOKS KEY CONCLUSIONS, IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT BIRTH PRACTICES AND LOOK AT A MOTHERS EMOTIONAL STATE AS NOT JUST NOT AT ALL INCIDENTAL. I THINK THE IDEA THAT FEELING IS CONNECTED TO OUR BIOLOGY AND HAS THESE SORT OF BIOLOGIC IMPLICATIONS, WE CAN SEE IT IN OUR BIOLOGY IS A PRETTY DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE FIELD. A FIELD THAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY TALK THERAPY AND BY APPROACHES REALLY FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS, NOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN. THATS WHERE I THINK DR. JANOV IS REALLY LOOKING TO GO. KR: WELL, IT EXCITES ME BECAUSE I THINK IT OPENS A HUGE DOOR. I THINK IT OPENS AN ENORMOUS DOOR OF UNDERSTANDING AND OF SUGGESTING VERY FUNDAMENTAL, NONE ESOTERIC, AS HE SAYS, SIMPLE BIRTH PRACTICES, PRACTICES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILD BIRTHING THAT CAN HAVE THE MOST DRAMATIC AND FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR HUMAN FUTURE. IT CAN PROBABLY DO MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE BILLABLE HOURS IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROFESSION. JL: YES, I THINK THERE WAS A CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK THAT CAME ABOUT LATER SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH PREGNANCY, AND I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME WORKING WITH DR. JANOV IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND JUST KIND OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE CONSTANT INFLUX OF NEW IDEAS AND RESEARCH HE WAS EXPOSING ME TO AND ALL THE WORK THAT WAS BEING DONE, IN THE FIELD OF EPIGENETICS AND IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL HEALTH AND NEW STUDIES HE WAS SHOWING ME ABOUT MEMORY AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE OTHER TOPICS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK REALLY STUCK WAS THIS IDEA ABOUT WHAT TO DO DURING PREGNANCY. AND HE ENDED UP SORT OF WRITING A CHAPTER ON PREGNANCY AND JUST OFFERING SOME ALMOST CONCRETE PIECES OF ADVICE FOR WOMEN THAT CAN HAVE SOME REALLY LASTING IMPLICATIONS.  THE US IS THE DOMINANT NATION, WITH 49 INSTITUTIONS, AHEAD OF THE UK (30), THE NETHERLANDS (12), GERMANY (11), CANADA, AUSTRALIA, AND JAPAN (8), CHINA (7), FRANCE, SWEDEN AND HONG KONG (5) SOWTER ADDS "IF, HOWEVER, INDIA AND HER UNIVERSITIES ARE SERIOUS ABOUT COMPETING INTERNATIONALLY, THEN THEY HAVE TO START ENGAGING INTERNATIONALLY. AS HE WRITES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OXYMORON FOR ME TO GIVE ADVICE SINCE I AM NOT BY PROFESSION NOR INTENTION AN AFICIONADO OF ADVICE. BUT LET US NOT MINIMIZE WHAT A CARRYING MOTHER CAN DO FOR THE GOOD OR BAD OF HER CHILD. IT IS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THAT HE APPROACHES THE SUBJECT, BECAUSE HE IS MALE AND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT IF YOURE SORT OF PROVIDING SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOW IT BEHAVED. BUT THINGS LIKE WATCHING YOUR STRESS; IF I CAN READ JUST A COUPLE PARTS OF THIS CHAPTER I THINK ITS REALLY IMPORTANT.  MARIN POURED US THE SUIT AND TIE (WE KNOW, THATS TIMBERLAKE, WHATEVER). THERE IS NO WAY TO ELIMINATE STRESS ENTIRELY, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS TO MANAGE IT. DONT PLAN A NEW BUSINESS OR START A SERIES OF COMPLICATED PROJECTS THAT PUT YOU UNDER STRESS WHILE PREGNANT.  18 BOMBAY HOOK COIN LAUNCH CEREMONY: 10 A.M., BOMBAY HOOK NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, 2591 WHITEHALL NECK ROAD, OFF OF ROUTE 9, ABOUT FIVE MILES SOUTHEAST OF SMYRNA AND ONE MILE NORTH OF LEIPSIC. THE BABY WILL FEEL THIS ANXIETY AND SUFFER. TRY TO WORK OUT PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SPOUSE BEFORE YOU GET PREGNANT. ONCE YOU ARE PREGNANT, IT IS LARGELY TOO LATE. THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD NEVER ARGUE OR FIGHT AGAIN; BUT TRY TO RESOLVE THE MORE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES BEFORE YOU INTRODUCE A NEW LIFE ON THIS PLANET. THE BABY DESERVES HIS OR HER BEST CHANCE AT LIFE, AND WHAT YOU DO DURING PREGNANCY TO MANAGE YOUR STRESS IS IMPORTANT, IN THAT REGARD. HE TALKS ABOUT EATING RIGHT AND GETTING PROTEIN, CALCIUM, FOLIC ACID, FIBER. HE TALKS ABOUT BEING VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GOING ABOUT TRANQUILIZERS AND PAINKILLERS TO RELIVE ANXIETY. NEW STUDIES ARE COMING OUT ALL THE TIME ON THIS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NEW STUDIES ON THE USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS, THE USE OF TRANQUILIZERS DURING PREGNANCY, AND WERE STILL KIND OF FIGURING OUT WHAT ALL THIS DOES, ULTIMATELY IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE MOTHER TO KEEP HER EMOTIONS BALANCED BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO SEE WHAT OTHER EFFECTS THIS COULD HAVE DURING GESTATION. I THINK THE MAIN THING HE FOCUSES ON ALL OF THIS IS LOVE. TO TOUCH YOUR BABY EARLY ON, TO BREASTFEED IF YOU CAN, HE SAYS, "READ FRENCH OBSTETRICIAN FREDERIC LEBOYER, WHO POPULARIZED THE PRACTICE OF IMMERSING THE NEWBORN IN A WARM WATER BATH, WITHOUT DRUGS AND WITHOUT BRIGHT LIGHTS. LEBOYER RECOMMENDS THAT THE BABY BE HELD RIGHT AWAY AND FOR A LONG TIME. HE ADVISES AGAINST CUTTING THE UMBILICAL CORD TOO SOON AS THE CHILD'S ATTACHMENT WITH HIS MOTHER IS VITAL AT THE START OF LIFE." "THERE IS NO GREATER ADVICE I CAN GIVE THAN THIS: BE OPEN, EXPRESSIVE, AND FEELING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. A CARING MOTHER GIVES HER BABY THE BEST CHANCE FOR LONG-TERM WELL-BEING. YES, EVEN IF YOU DON'T EAT THOSE CARROTS AND TOMATOES WHEN YOU SHOULD, LOVE WILL HELP.  FARM VEHICLES FROM TRUCKS TO TRACTORS WILL BE SHARING LOCAL ROADS AND HIGHWAYS THIS HARVEST SEASON WITH PASSENGER VEHICLES. YOUR CHILD IS PART OF YOU AND FEELS WHAT YOU FEEL, EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS IT. ALL I ASK IS AWARENESS. THE RESEARCH IS THERE; WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS ANYMORE." HE'S PUTTING IT OUT THERE, WE HAVE RESEARCH INTO THIS FIELD, WE CAN'T TURN A BLIND EYE TO IT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN.

SATURDAY, COMMUNITY MEMBERS HELD THE THIRD ANNUAL RACE FOR WANDELL. WE ALL DO OUR PART TO EMBRACE FAITH OVER FEAR, SAID THE MC. ITS A SAYING THIS CARTER COUNTY COMMUNITY GRASPED ONTO. WANDELLS BROTHER, NEAL, SAID, HES A LIVING EXAMPLE HIS FAITH IS 10 TIMES MORE THAN HIS FEARS. ITS SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD VERY EASILY GIVE UP, BUT HES A VERY STRONG INDIVIDUAL. HES NOT WILLING TO LET THIS DISEASE OVERCOME HIM, SAID WANDELLS PHYSICAL THERAPIST MICHAEL LOWE. FAMILY MEMBERS SAY WANDELLS FAITH OVER FEAR IS STRONGER THAN EVER. YOU DONT THINK ABOUT HIM BEING SICK, BECAUSE HELL TALK TO YOU. WE YALK ABOUT SPORTS, WERE TALKING ABOUT FANTASY FOOTBALL, NEAL SAID. WHILE THE DISEASE STEALS THE ABILITY TO MOVE, COMMUNITY MEMBERS IMPACTED BY WANDELLS FIGHT MOVED FOR HIM. TO HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY COME OUT AND BE WILLING TO WALK, AND DO THIS WALK FOR JOSH IS AMAZING, LOWE TOLD NEWS CHANNEL 11. FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW, A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WALKED OR RAN THREE MILES AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WANDELL WAS ONCE A PRINCIPAL AT.

237	FIRST DEMONSTRATION OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE VIEW 0 COMMENTS EMERGING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE ARXIV SEPTEMBER 10, 2015 FIRST DEMONSTRATION OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE NEXT TIME YOU NEED TO CHOOSE, WHY NOT LET A PHOTON MAKE THE DECISION INSTEAD? IMAGINE WALKING INTO A CASINO TO PLAY THE ONE-ARMED BANDITS.YOUVE HEARD THAT ONE OF THEM PAYS OUT MORE THAN THE OTHERS, SO YOUR GOAL IS TO FIND OUT WHICH. BUT HOW MUCH OF YOUR RESOURCES SHOULD YOU POUR INTO EXPLORING THE MACHINES BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO EXPLOIT ONE OF THEM? THIS PROBLEM IS KNOWN AS THE EXPLORATION-EXPLOITATION DILEMMA, AND IT CROPS UP IN ALL KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES, FROM OIL EXPLORATION TO GAMBLING TO BUSINESS PLANNING. THE DIFFICULTY, OF COURSE, IS THAT THE MACHINES ARE PROBABILISTIC, SO IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO BE TRICKED INTO PLAYING A POORLY PAYING MACHINE BY A GOOD RUN THAT OCCURS BY CHANCE. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF ALGORITHMS THAT CAN HELP. THESE ARE COMPUTER PROGRAMS OF VARYING DEGREES OF COMPLEXITY THAT SIMULATE WHAT IS GOING ON AND USE PROBABILITY THEORY TO CALCULATE THE BEST NEXT MOVE. BUT NOW THERE IS ANOTHER WAY. TODAY, MAKOTO NARUSE AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY IN TOKYO, JAPAN, AND PALS POINT OUT THAT THE LAWS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS ARE PROBABILISTIC, AND SO PROVIDE A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT FOR DECISION THEORY. AND THATS ALLOWED THEM TO BUILD AN EXTRAORDINARY DECISION-MAKING DEVICE. THEIR NEW TOY IS A PHOTON GUN AND A SINGLE PHOTON DETECTOR THAT USES THE LAWS OF PHYSICS TO MAKE DECISIONS, RATHER THAN COMPLEX ALGORITHMS. THE DEVICE RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS KIND OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE COULD HELP MAKE COMPLEX DECISIONS. THE THEORY IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. ONE STRATEGY TO FIND THE BEST PAYING ONE-ARMED BANDIT IS TO START FEEDING THE MACHINES AND COUNT HOW MUCH THEY PAY OUT EACH TIME. THEN, AS YOU LEARN, FEED MORE INTO THE MACHINES THAT PAY BETTER UNTIL YOU FIND THE BEST. THE SINGLE PHOTON DECISION MAKER DOES ALL THIS AUTOMATICALLY. IT CONSISTS OF A GUN THAT FIRES PHOTONS THROUGH A POLARIZING FILTER. THIS FILTER CAN BE ADJUSTED TO POLARIZE THE PHOTONS HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY. WHEN IT IS AT 45 DEGREES, HOWEVER, EACH PHOTON HAS AN EQUAL CHANCE OF BEING HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY POLARIZED. SO THIS SET UP PRODUCES A STEADY STREAM OF PHOTONS POLARIZED EITHER HORIZONTALLY OR VERTICALLY WITH A 50 PERCENT CHANCE OF EACH. ROTATING THE FILTER CHANGES THESE ODDS. MOVING THE FILTER TOWARD THE VERTICAL INCREASES THE CHANCES OF VERTICAL POLARIZATION WHILE REDUCING THE CHANCES OF HORIZONTAL POLARIZATION. SO IN THIS SETUP, MORE PHOTONS WILL BE VERTICALLY POLARIZED. NEXT, NARUSE AND CO USE THE POLARIZATION OF THE PHOTONS TO CHOOSE WHICH OF TWO SLOT MACHINES TO PLAY. FOR EXAMPLE, A VERTICAL PHOTON MEANS A PLAY ON THE FIRST BANDIT WHILE A HORIZONTAL PHOTON MEANS A PLAY ON THE SECOND BANDIT. THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS COMES BY CREATING A FEEDBACK LOOP THAT CHANGES THE ORIENTATION OF THE POLARIZING FILTER AFTER EACH PLAY. SO IF THE FIRST BANDIT PAYS OUT, THE FILTER MOVES TO THE VERTICAL MAKING IT MORE LIKELY TO BE PLAYED IN FUTURE. BUT IF A HORIZONTAL PHOTON TRIGGERS A PAYOUT, THE FILTER MOVES TO THE HORIZONTAL. IN THIS WAY, THE PHOTON MACHINE LEARNS WHICH MACHINE PAYS OUT MORE OFTEN. WHATS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS SETUP IS THAT IT REQUIRES NO STANDARD COMPUTING, NO SIMULATION OF THE SYSTEM, AND NO NUMBER CRUNCHING OF PROBABILITIES. INSTEAD, THE LAWS OF PHYSICS MAKE THE DECISION VIA A SIMPLE FEEDBACK MECHANISM. THIS IS NOT JUST THEORETICAL WORK. NARUSE AND CO HAVE BUILT THEIR OWN PHOTON DECISION-MAKER USING A PHOTON GUN MADE FROM A NITROGEN VACANCY IN NANODIAMAOND. THE PHOTONS FROM THIS DEVICE DETERMINE WHICH OF TWO SLOT MACHINES TO PLAY WITH THE RESULTS FED BACK TO CHANGE THE ORIENTATION OF A POLARIZATION FILTER. THE RESULTS ARE IMPRESSIVE. THE SINGLE PHOTON DECISION-MAKER QUICKLY FINDS THE BEST PAYING BANDIT AND EVEN CHANGES ITS MIND WHEN NARUSE AND CO CHANGE THE PAYOUT ODDS OF THE MACHINES. WE EXPERIMENTALLY DEMONSTRATE ACCURATE AND ADAPTIVE DECISION MAKING, THEY SAY. THATS INTERESTING WORK THAT HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR INTELLIGENT MACHINES. ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS NEW MACHINE IS ITS SIMPLICITYIT REQUIRES NO STANDARD COMPUTING MACHINERY AT ALL. IT CAN ALSO BE TINY, OPERATING ON A SCALE OF NANOMETERS WHILE USING VERY LITTLE POWER. BUT IT IS CONCEPTUALLY WHERE THE NEW DEVICE MIGHT HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT. THERE IS A CLEAR FEELING THAT INTELLIGENT MACHINES MUST RELY ON ELECTRONIC COMPUTATION TO MAKE DECISIONS. NARUSE AND CO SHOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. INSTEAD, A NEW KIND OF PHOTONIC INTELLIGENCE USES THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AND CLEVER DESIGN SEEM TO DECIDE FOR ITSELF.

238	NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) - A MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER AND ROBBERY WILL NOW BE CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE STABBING DEATH OF HIS GIRLFRIEND. PORSCHA CLARK, A 26-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF THREE, WAS FOUND STABBED TO DEATH INSIDE HER APARTMENT IN THE TRINITY HILLS VILLAGE COMPLEX ON SUNDAY NIGHT. CLARKS BOYFRIEND, 43-YEAR-OLD SAMUEL COPELAND, WAS IDENTIFIED AS A POSSIBLE SUSPECT IN HER MURDER. INVESTIGATORS SAID COPELAND WAS INVOLVED IN AN OVERNIGHT HIT-AND-RUN CRASH IN WARREN COUNTY WHILE DRIVING CLARKS CAR. HE FLED INTO A NEARBY WOODED AREA AND WAS ARRESTED MONDAY MORNING FOR THE HIT-AND-RUN. METRO DETECTIVES TRAVELED TO MCMINNVILLE MONDAY AFTERNOON TO CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATION INTO CLARKS MURDER. EARLIER THIS MONTH, POLICE SAID CLARK SWORE OUT A MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC ASSAULT WARRANT AGAINST COPELAND, SAYING HE PUNCHED HER IN THE BACK OF HER HEAD AND FACE AFTER SHE DECLINED TO GIVE HIM A RIDE HOME FROM HER APARTMENT. COPELAND FLED BEFORE POLICE ARRIVED. AT THE TIME, POLICE SAID CLARK DECLINED OFFICERS OFFERS TO ARRANGE FOR COUNSELING, SHELTER AND AN ORDER OF PROTECTION. THE DOMESTIC ASSAULT ARREST WARRANT ON COPELAND WAS STILL OUTSTANDING AT THE TIME OF CLARKS MURDER, DESPITE OFFICERS ATTEMPTS TO SERVE IT ON SEPT. 7. POLICE SAID CLARKS RELATIONSHIP WITH COPELAND APPARENTLY CONTINUED, WITH COPELAND REPORTEDLY PICKING UP ONE OF CLARKS CHILDREN FROM A CAREGIVER ON FRIDAY. CLARK AND COPELAND WERE ALSO REPORTEDLY SEEN ARGUING AT A NASHVILLE NIGHTCLUB OVER THE WEEKEND. COPELAND WAS CONVICTED OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN 1993 AND RECEIVED A 25-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. HE WAS ALSO CONVICTED OF ROBBERY THAT SAME YEAR AND RECEIVED A 6-YEAR SENTENCE. METRO POLICE ARRESTED HIM IN 2007 FOR PAROLE VIOLATION. COPELAND REGISTERED WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS AN EX-CONVICT IN 2012. HE WAS ARRESTED THE FOLLOWING YEAR FOR MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC ASSAULT AGAINST HIS GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME. THAT CASE WAS RETIRED IN GENERAL SESSIONS COURT IN NOVEMBER 2013. INVESTIGATORS SAID THEY WILL BE SEEKING A CRIMINAL HOMICIDE WARRANT AGAINST COPELAND IN CONNECTION WITH CLARKS MURDER. OUTSIDE CLARK'S APARTMENT TUESDAY WERE FADED CHALK DRAWINGS OF A TURTLE, A SUN, A SPIDER IN A WEB AND A GAME OF HOPSCOTCH. NEIGHBORS SAID THEY WOULD OFTEN STEP OUT, LOOK DOWN THE HALL AND FIND CLARK DRAWING WITH HER THREE CHILDREN. THEY SAID A LITTLE NOTE WRITTEN ON A WALL COULDN'T BE MORE TRUE, "LOVE WAS HERE." "THE DANGER IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIPS IS REAL," SAID TRACY DETOMASI OF YWCA NASHVILLE. "A LOT OF TIMES, BECAUSE YOU LOVE THE PERSON AND YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH THEM, YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THEY CAN CHANGE. THEY WON'T DO THAT AGAIN. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE." "WE HAVE A CRISIS HOTLINE THAT'S 24 HOURS A DAY THAT THEY CAN CALL," DETOMASI CONTINUED. "THEY CAN CALL TO TALK. THEY CAN CALL TO GET A SAFETY PLAN. THEY CAN CALL TO GET INTO OUR SHELTER THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL. THE LOCATION IS CONFIDENTIAL. WE HAVE 51 BEDS, AND IT IS THE LARGEST IN TENNESSEE." YWCA OFFICIALS SAID WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS OUTREACH, LETTING OTHERS KNOW HELP IS AVAILABLE. "IT'S BEING AWARE OF WHAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS, WHY WOMEN DON'T LEAVE," SAID DETOMASI. "WE DON'T JUDGE THEM WHEN THEY WANT TO TELL THEIR STORIES." FOR MORE ON THE YWCA, CLICK HERE.

BUT A POLICE OFFICIAL SAID SHANNON LAMB, A SOCIAL SCIENCE AND GEOGRAPHY INSTRUCTOR AT DELTA STATE UNIVERSITY, GAVE NO MOTIVE FOR THE KILLINGS THAT PROMPTED A TENSE MANHUNT ON MONDAY BEFORE HE SHOT HIMSELF AS HE WAS CORNERED BY AUTHORITIES. POLICE SAID LAMB, 45, SHOT AND KILLED AMY PRENTISS, 41, AT THE HOME THEY SHARED IN GAUTIER, MISSISSIPPI BEFORE DRIVING 300 MILES (480 KM) TO DELTA STATE, WHERE HE FATALLY SHOT COLLEAGUE ETHAN SCHMIDT, AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF AMERICAN HISTORY. "VERY SORRY," READ THE HANDWRITTEN NOTE SIGNED BY LAMB. "I WISH I COULD TAKE IT BACK. I LOVED AMY AND SHE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO EVER LOVED ME." AFTER ARRIVING MONDAY MORNING AT THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN CLEVELAND, MISSISSIPPI, LAMB CALLED POLICE TO REPORT THAT HE HAD KILLED PRENTISS THE NIGHT BEFORE, GAUTIER POLICE OFFICER MATT HOGGATT TOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE. CLEVELAND POLICE CHIEF CHARLES "BUSTER" BINGHAM PREVIOUSLY SAID IT DID NOT APPEAR THE SHOOTING VICTIMS KNEW EACH OTHER. "WE DON'T KNOW WHY THIS MAN DID WHAT HE DID," HE SAID. THE UNIVERSITY CANCELLED EVENTS TO COMMEMORATE ITS 90TH ANNIVERSARY AND INSTEAD PLANNED A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL TO HONOUR SCHMIDT ON TUESDAY NIGHT. SCHMIDT'S DEATH FOLLOWED SIMILAR INCIDENTS ON U.S. COLLEGE CAMPUSES IN RECENT WEEKS, INCLUDING AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA, TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY AND GEORGIA'S SAVANNAH STATE UNIVERSITY. WHILE ON THE RUN MONDAY, LAMB MADE STATEMENTS TO FAMILY REMEMBERS THAT WERE RELAYED TO POLICE THAT HE WOULD NOT TURN HIMSELF IN, HOGGATT SAID. AFTER GREENVILLE POLICE SPOTTED LAMB'S CAR AND BEGAN TO FOLLOW HIM, HE JUMPED FROM THE VEHICLE AND RAN, LAW ENFORCEMENT SAID. OFFICERS THEN HEARD A GUNSHOT. POLICE LOCKED DOWN THE DELTA STATE CAMPUS AND SEARCHED BUILDINGS ON MONDAY AFTER THE REPORTS OF GUNFIRE. DELTA STATE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT WILLIAM LAFORGE PRAISED SCHMIDT, 39, A MARRIED FATHER OF THREE CHILDREN, AS A "STAR" PROFESSOR. "I THOUGHT THE WORLD OF HIM," LAFORGE SAID. LAFORGE SAID LAMB WAS TEACHING TWO ONLINE COURSES DURING THE FALL SEMESTER AND DID NOT WANT A FULL LOAD, CITING MEDICAL ISSUES.

245	CONTINUO A COPIARE, SONO QUI: [DOC]/GUIDE/MACROS.HTML, ANZI QUI: [DOC]/GUIDE/PROC-MACROS.HTML. AGGREGARE PATTERNS ED ESPRESSIONI: SYNTAX-CASE THE PROCEDURE GENERATED BY SYNTAX-RULES INTERNALLY USES SYNTAX-E TO DECONSTRUCT THE GIVEN SYNTAX OBJECT, AND IT USES DATUM->SYNTAX TO CONSTRUCT THE RESULT. THE SYNTAX-RULES FORM DOESNT PROVIDE A WAY TO ESCAPE FROM PATTERN-MATCHING AND TEMPLATE-CONSTRUCTION MODE INTO AN ARBITRARY RACKET EXPRESSION. THE SYNTAX-CASE FORM LETS YOU MIX PATTERN MATCHING, TEMPLATE CONSTRUCTION, AND ARBITRARY EXPRESSIONS: (SYNTAX-CASE STX-EXPR (LITERAL-ID ...) [PATTERN EXPR] ...) UNLIKE SYNTAX-RULES, THE SYNTAX-CASE FORM DOES NOT PRODUCE A PROCEDURE. INSTEAD, IT STARTS WITH A STX-EXPR EXPRESSION THAT DETERMINES THE SYNTAX OBJECT TO MATCH AGAINST THE PATTERNS. ALSO, EACH SYNTAX-CASE CLAUSE HAS A PATTERN AND EXPR, INSTEAD OF A PATTERN AND TEMPLATE. WITHIN AN EXPR, THE SYNTAX FORMUSUALLY ABBREVIATED WITH #'SHIFTS INTO TEMPLATE-CONSTRUCTION MODE; IF THE EXPR OF A CLAUSE STARTS WITH #', THEN WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A SYNTAX-RULES FORM: WE COULD WRITE THE SWAP MACRO USING SYNTAX-CASE INSTEAD OF DEFINE-SYNTAX-RULE OR SYNTAX-RULES: ONE ADVANTAGE OF USING SYNTAX-CASE IS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE BETTER ERROR REPORTING FOR SWAP. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE DEFINE-SYNTAX-RULE DEFINITION OF SWAP, THEN (SWAP X 2) PRODUCES A SYNTAX ERROR IN TERMS OF SET!, BECAUSE 2 IS NOT AN IDENTIFIER. WE CAN REFINE OUR SYNTAX-CASE IMPLEMENTATION OF SWAP TO EXPLICITLY CHECK THE SUB-FORMS: WITH THIS DEFINITION, (SWAP X 2) PROVIDES A SYNTAX ERROR ORIGINATING FROM SWAP INSTEAD OF SET!. IN THE ABOVE DEFINITION OF SWAP, #'X AND #'Y ARE TEMPLATES, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT USED AS THE RESULT OF THE MACRO TRANSFORMER. THIS EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES HOW TEMPLATES CAN BE USED TO ACCESS PIECES OF THE INPUT SYNTAX, IN THIS CASE FOR CHECKING THE FORM OF THE PIECES. ALSO, THE MATCH FOR #'X OR #'Y IS USED IN THE CALL TO RAISE-SYNTAX-ERROR, SO THAT THE SYNTAX-ERROR MESSAGE CAN POINT DIRECTLY TO THE SOURCE LOCATION OF THE NON-IDENTIFIER. WITH-SYNTAX E GENERATE-TEMPORARIES SINCE SYNTAX-CASE LETS US COMPUTE WITH ARBITRARY RACKET EXPRESSIONS, WE CAN MORE SIMPLY SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT WE HAD IN WRITING DEFINE-FOR-CBR (SEE EXTENDED EXAMPLE: CALL-BY-REFERENCE FUNCTIONS UN ESEMPIO ESTESO: FUNZIONI CALL-BY-REFERENCE), WHERE WE NEEDED TO GENERATE A SET OF NAMES BASED ON A SEQUENCE ID ...: (DEFINE-SYNTAX (DEFINE-FOR-CBR STX) (SYNTAX-CASE STX () [(_ DO-F (ID ...) BODY) .... #'(DEFINE (DO-F GET ... PUT ...) (DEFINE-GET/PUT-ID ID GET PUT) ... BODY) ....])) IN PLACE OF THE ....S ABOVE, WE NEED TO BIND GET ... AND PUT ... TO LISTS OF GENERATED IDENTIFIERS. WE CANNOT USE LET TO BIND GET AND PUT, BECAUSE WE NEED BINDINGS THAT COUNT AS PATTERN VARIABLES, INSTEAD OF NORMAL LOCAL VARIABLES. THE WITH-SYNTAX FORM LETS US BIND PATTERN VARIABLES: NOW WE NEED AN EXPRESSION IN PLACE OF .... THAT GENERATES AS MANY IDENTIFIERS AS THERE ARE ID MATCHES IN THE ORIGINAL PATTERN. SINCE THIS IS A COMMON TASK, RACKET PROVIDES A HELPER FUNCTION, GENERATE-TEMPORARIES, THAT TAKES A SEQUENCE OF IDENTIFIERS AND RETURNS A SEQUENCE OF GENERATED IDENTIFIERS: THIS WAY OF GENERATING IDENTIFIERS IS NORMALLY EASIER TO THINK ABOUT THAN TRICKING THE MACRO EXPANDER INTO GENERATING NAMES WITH PURELY PATTERN-BASED MACROS. IN GENERAL, THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF A WITH-SYNTAX BINDING IS A PATTERN, JUST LIKE IN SYNTAX-CASE. IN FACT, A WITH-SYNTAX FORM IS JUST A SYNTAX-CASE FORM TURNED PARTIALLY INSIDE-OUT. :MRGREEN:
246	BY ZHIQUN ZHU (CHINA DAILY USA) UPDATED: 2015-09-23 11:51:27 PESSIMISM ABOUT US-CHINA RELATIONS SEEMS TO BE PERMEATING THE AIR RECENTLY. MANY OBSERVERS ON BOTH SIDES HAVE RUNG ALARM BELLS ABOUT GROWING TENSION IN THE RELATIONSHIP, ESPECIALLY OVER CYBERSECURITY, THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND STOCK MARKET TURMOIL. WHAT HAS GONE WRONG? HOW CAN THE TWO COUNTRIES MOVE THIS VITAL RELATIONSHIP FORWARD? IN 1940, KENNETH WHERRY, MAYOR OF PAWNEE CITY, NEBRASKA, SAID, "WITH GOD'S HELP, WE WILL LIFT SHANGHAI UP AND UP, EVER UP, UNTIL IT IS JUST LIKE KANSAS CITY." IF WHERRY, WHO BECAME A US SENATOR LATER, WERE STILL ALIVE TODAY, HE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT MODERN SHANGHAI REMAINS DIFFERENT FROM KANSAS CITY, BUT IT IS PROBABLY KANSAS CITY THAT NEEDS TO BE LIFTED UP IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT NOW. AMERICANS HAVE A MISSIONARY IMPULSE TO CHANGE CHINA, EITHER BY CHRISTIANIZING IT IN THE 19TH CENTURY OR DEMOCRATIZING IT IN THE 21ST CENTURY. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF INTERACTIONS, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN DEALING WITH CHINA FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH; IT IS ILL-PREPARED TO LIVE WITH A NATION AS BIG AND ALMOST AS POWERFUL AS ITSELF. CHINA'S METEORIC RE-EMERGENCE AS A GLOBAL POWER BY THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY IS TRULY STUNNING TO AMERICANS AND EVEN TO MANY CHINESE. THE US ECONOMY SUFFERED SERIOUSLY IN THE 2008-2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS, FROM WHICH IT IS STILL RECOVERING. MEANWHILE, THE CHINESE ECONOMY HAS CONTINUED TO CHARGE FORWARD, AND AFTER OVERTAKING JAPAN AS THE WORLD'S SECOND-LARGEST ECONOMY IN 2010, IT IS POISED TO TAKE THE TOP SPOT SOON. THE GLOBAL POWER STRUCTURE HAS CHANGED FUNDAMENTALLY. THE AMERICAN CONCERN ABOUT CHINA'S RISING POWER REFLECTS AMERICANS' LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THEIR COMPETITION WITH CHINA. THE REALITY IS THAT CHINA REMAINS A DEVELOPING COUNTRY DESPITE A LARGE ECONOMY. ACCORDING TO PREMIER LI KEQIANG, 200 MILLION CHINESE STILL LIVE IN POVERTY. CHINA FACES TREMENDOUS DOMESTIC CHALLENGES, INCLUDING A WIDENING INCOME GAP, AN AGING POPULATION, RAMPANT CORRUPTION AND A DETERIORATING ENVIRONMENT. THE UNITED STATES REMAINS FAR AHEAD OF CHINA, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION. THE TWO ECONOMIES AND SOCIETIES ARE COMPLEMENTARY IN MANY ASPECTS. A RECENT STUDY BY THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON US-CHINA RELATIONS AND THE RHODIUM GROUP REVEALS THAT FROM 2000 TO 2014, CHINESE FIRMS SPENT NEARLY $46 BILLION ON NEW ESTABLISHMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS IN THE US. CHINESE-AFFILIATED COMPANIES DIRECTLY EMPLOY MORE THAN 80,000 AMERICANS. IF THE US CONTINUES TO WELCOME CHINA'S BOOMING INVESTMENT, IT COULD RECEIVE BETWEEN $100 BILLION TO $200 BILLION FROM CHINA BY 2020, WHICH WOULD ADD BETWEEN 200,000 AND 400,000 FULL-TIME JOBS IN THE US. CHINA IS THE LARGEST TRADING PARTNER OF A GROWING NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, FROM ASIA TO AFRICA AND FROM LATIN AMERICA TO THE MIDDLE EAST. A TRADE REGIME WITHOUT CHINA'S PARTICIPATION IS UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED. CHINA-LED NEW INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE ASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT BANK (AIIB) COMPLEMENT THE WORK OF THE WORLD BANK AND ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK. "PIVOT" AND "NEW TYPE OF GREAT POWER RELATIONS" ARE ATTEMPTS BY THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, RESPECTIVELY, TO HANDLE THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP, BUT THEY ARE POORLY DEFINED AND LARGELY MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE OTHER SIDE. AMERICANS GENERALLY BELIEVE THAT CHINA HAS BECOME MORE ASSERTIVE IN FOREIGN POLICY AND INTENDS TO REPLACE THE US IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS. MANY CHINESE GENUINELY THINK THE UNITED STATES IS TRYING TO BLOCK CHINA'S RISE. LACK OF TRUST HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE OUTSTANDING PROBLEM BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. BUT HOW TO BUILD TRUST? GOING FORWARD, THE TWO COUNTRIES MUST FIRST READJUST THEIR MENTALITY. FOR CHINA, THE PRIORITY REMAINS AT HOME. CHINESE LEADERS MUST RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO FLEX MUSCLES ABROAD. IT IS NOT TIME TO ABANDON DENG XIAOPING'S DICTUM OF LYING LOW AND FOCUSING ON GROWTH. THE UNITED STATES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MUST BE REALISTIC AND REMOVE IDEOLOGICAL LENSES TO OVERCOME THE "CHINA FEAR". IT MUST ALSO REIN IN ITS SMALLER ALLIES IN ASIA SO AS TO AVOID CONFLICTS THAT WILL DRAG THE US AND CHINA INTO DIRECT CONFRONTATION. CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE JOINED AT THE HIP. THERE IS NO BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THEM. THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO ALLOW HARDLINERS OR PROTECTIONISTS TO INTERFERE WITH THE GENERALLY COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP. DISAGREEMENT ON CERTAIN ISSUES AND OCCASIONAL QUARRELS ARE PART OF THE NORMAL LIFE IN A RELATIONSHIP. MUTUAL ACCOMMODATION AND APPRECIATION WILL ENHANCE PERSONAL RELATIONS AS WELL AS RELATIONS BETWEEN NATIONS.

248	UPDATE. THE CASE HAS EVEN INVOLVED MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER, WHO DEFENDED THE STATE AGENCY.  THIS ISNT THE KIND OF SITUATION WHERE NO ONE WAS PAYING ANY ATTENTION AT ALL. JACK LOISELLE WAS BORN INTO AN UNSTABLE AND DISTURBING FAMILY SITUATION. HIS DAD RANDALL LINTS LEFT THE BOYS MOTHER, AMBER LOISELLE, BEFORE JACK WAS BORN, AND SHE OBTAINED A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HIM NINE DAYS AFTER THE BIRTH, STATING THAT LINTS THREATENED TO HARM HER. YET SOMEHOW, LINTS, A ROOFER BY TRADE BUT WHO WAS UNEMPLOYED AT THE TIME THE ALLEGED ABUSE OCCURRED WAS GRANTED CUSTODY OF THE BOY LAST SUMMER. ACCORDING TO MASSACHUSETTS STATE POLICE DOCUMENTS REVEALED BY NEW ENGLAND CABLE NEWS , LINTS LOCKED THE BOY IN A BEDROOM THAT WAS EQUIPPED WITH AN ALARM AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM.  PERHAPS HE IS MERELY TERRIFIED AT GETTING OLDER, AND THE ENORMOUS CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN HIS COUNTRY. TO CONTROL WHAT HE AND CHADWICK SAID WERE SEVERE, EVEN VIOLENT BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS, LINTS TOOK EXTREME MEASURES, DEPRIVING HIM OF FOOD AND FLUIDS SUPPOSEDLY TO CONTROL JACKS TOILET TRAINING ISSUES. IN ADDITION TO SYMPTOMS OF STARVATION JACK WAS FOUND ON JULY 14 WITH BLEACH BURNS ON HIS LEGS BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THE STATE POLICE, LINTS AND CHADWICK FORCED HIM TO SCRUB FLOORS AS A MEANS OF DISCIPLINE. THE POLICE SAID THAT CHADWICK TOLD THEM OF JACKS BEHAVIORAL DIFFICULTIES, CLAIMING THE HE ONCE TRIED TO STRANGLE ONE OF THE YOUNGER KIDS IN THE HOME, AND WAS ALSO CRUEL TO ANIMALS. ONE KITTEN THAT JACK ABUSED, CHADWICK CLAIMED, HAD TO BE EUTHANIZED DUE THE INJURIES THE BOY INFLICTED.  CAREER POLITICIANS. JACKS MOTHER, WHEN QUESTIONED BY BOSTON-AREA MEDIA OUTLETS, DECLINED TO COMMENT ON JACKS BEHAVIORAL DIFFICULTIES, OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE CASE, SAYING THAT SHE WAS ADVISED NOT TO SPEAK BY HER ATTORNEYS. RANDALL LINTS IS STILL BEING HELD ON $200,000 BAIL. ALEXANDREA CHADWICK IS SCHEDULED TO BE ARRAIGNED ON THE ABUSE CHARGES ON SEPTEMBER 28. [IMAGES: WCVB, NECN SCREEN CAPTURES] IS AN ARTICLE FROM: THE INQUISITR NEWS RANDALL LINTS, A 26-YEAR-OLD HARDWICK, MASSACHUSETTS DAD, AND HIS GIRLFRIEND ALEXANDREA CHADWICK WHO AT 22 YEARS OLD IS THE MOTHER OF LINTS TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN WERE BOTH INDICTED FRIDAY ON CHARGES THAT THEY ABUSED AND NEGLECTED LINTS SEVEN-YEAR-OLD SON JACK LOISELLE SO BADLY THAT THE BOY HAS BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL SINCE JULY 14.  AND WERE ANNOYED BY HAVING TO ACTUALLY SEARCH OUT A HOT SPOT. THE CASE HAS MADE HEADLINES IN MASSACHUSETTS NOT ONLY DUE TO THE HORRIFIC ABUSE INFLICTED ON THE BOY, BUT BECAUSE THE STATES DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES HAD BEEN MONITORING THE SITUATION IN THE LINTS HOUSEHOLD SINCE FEBRUARY, AND LAST VISITED THE HOME ON JUNE 29. THAT VISIT CAME SLIGHTLY MORE THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE LITTLE JACK WAS FOUND UNRESPONSIVE, AND WEIGHING JUST 38 POUNDS ABOUT A 25 PERCENT DROP IN BODY WEIGHT FROM HIS NORMAL 50 POUNDS.
249	WATERLOO THE MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS FORMER FIVE POINTS CORRECTIONAL FACILITY INMATE WILL GO ON TRIAL IN NOVEMBER. SENECA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY BARRY PORSCH SAID JURY SELECTION IN THE TRIAL OF BRIAN KARRIS WILL OCCUR NOV. 13. OPENING STATEMENTS AND TESTIMONY BEGIN OCT. 16. PORSCH IS PROSECUTING THE CASE. HE SAID HE EXPECTS THE TRIAL TO LAST ABOUT FIVE DAYS.  JERRY COONS JR. KARRIS, 38, IS CHARGED WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN THE DEC. 14, 2013, DEATH OF THOMAS BLANCKE AT THE MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON IN ROMULUS.  ADIDAS AND NIKE DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT.  TRAFFIC INSPECTOR C. CORRECTIONS OFFICERS FOUND BLANCKE, 24, DEAD AT ABOUT 6 A.M. IN THE CELL HE SHARED WITH KARRIS.  ITS INOVATIVE APPROACH HAS TRANSLATED INTO MAJOR ALLIANCES WITH LEADERS IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SUCH AS BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB, ASTRAZENECA AND NOVO NORDISK A/S.

THE JURY WILL SEE A 35-MINUTE INTERVIEW BEWEEN KARRIS AND CIVILIAN OFFICIALS WITH HE STATE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES; THE LATTER QUESTIONED KARRIS AFTER THE INCIDENT. ON THE VIDEOTAPE, KARRIS SAID HE AND BLANCKE FOUGHT BECAUSE BLANCKE TOOK HIS MATTRESS, SAYING WHEN HE WENT TO HIS CELL FOR THE NIGHT, BLANCKE HAD PLACED IT UNDER HIS OWN BEDDING.  CONSULTING SERVICES ARE ALSO PROVIDED BY MANUFACTURES TO HELP CONSUMERS CHOOSE THE MOST EFFECTIVE DRY CONSTRUCTION FOR THEIR LIVING AND COMMERCIAL SPACES. IN AN INTERVIEW THAT WAS RAMBLING AT TIMES, KARRIS SAID THE ARGUMENT BECAME HEATED ABOUT 3:30 A.M. AND TURNED PHYSICAL WHEN BLANCKE REFUSED TO RELINQUISH THE MATTRESS. KARRIS CLAIMED BLANCKE STARTED THE FIGHT. AT ONE POINT, KARRIS SAID BLANCKE HAD HIM IN A CHOKEHOLD. HE SAID HE EVENTUALLY PUNCHED BLANCKE IN THE FACE AND LATER STOMPED HIS HEAD. HE WAS CHOKING ME TO DEATH, KARRIS SAID DURING THE INTERVIEW. I SAID, ITS DO OR DIE ... SO I SUBDUED HIM. I DID NOT WANT TO KILL HIM. IT DIDNT HAVE TO COME TO THIS.  ASL PROVIDED. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT BLANCKE WAS INJURED BADLY, KARRIS SAID HE DIDNT KNOW HE WAS DEAD UNTIL LATER THAT DAY. KARRIS WAS MOVED OUT OF FIVE POINTS FOLLOWING BLANCKES DEATH AND IS NOW INCARCERATED AT ELMIRA CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.  HOWEVER, HE ADDED THAT KARRIS SAW IT AND HE CONSENTED FOR IT TO BE SHOWN TO THE JURY.

BUT THE 34-YEAR-OLD FROM WARWICK DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND NOW SHE HAS THOUSANDS OF FANS AROUND THE WORLD. BACK IN 2002, NIKKI WAS REACHING A SIZE 16 AND HATED LOOKING AT PICTURES OF HERSELF. SHE WAS STUDYING FOR A BUSINESS DEGREE AT DERBY UNIVERSITY, BUT SHE FELT SAD AND FRUSTRATED, WITH NO REAL CONFIDENCE. I JUST FELT SO AWFUL ABOUT MYSELF, SHE TOLD THE COVENTRY TELEGRAPH. "IT GOT SO BAD I WAS GOING TO QUIT MY DEGREE AND MOVE HOME. INSTEAD, WHAT SHE DID NEXT CHANGED HER LIFE. IT LED TO A NEW LOOK, NEW JOB AND 47,000 FOLLOWERS ON FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM, AFTER SETTING UP A BLOG THAT BLENDS HER TWO FAVOURITE THINGS FOOD AND SHOPPING. NIKKI LOST A WHOPPING THREE STONE IN THREE MONTHS WITH SLIMMING WORLD - AND HAS KEPT IT OFF OVER THE PAST 13 YEARS. NOW SHE SHARES RECIPES AND FASHION TIPS AS WELL AS WORDS OF SUPPORT AND ADVICE FOR OTHER PEOPLE ON THEIR WEIGHT LOSS JOURNEY. I RUN A SUCCESSFUL GROUP EVERY THURSDAY IN LEAMINGTON, EXPLAINS NIKKI, WHO IS NOW A SENIOR CONSULTANT/TEAM MANAGER FOR SLIMMING WORLD, BUT VIA SOCIAL MEDIA, I WAS GETTING QUESTIONS FROM ALL OVER. PEOPLE ASKED ME ALL THE TIME ABOUT WHAT I EAT, WHERE I BUY MY CLOTHES FROM, OR WHAT MAKE UP I USE, SO I THOUGHT ID START SHARING IT ON A BLOG. I CANT BELIEVE HOW QUICKLY ITS GROWN! THE FEEDBACK IVE HAD IS JUST AMAZING. THERE ARE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT SEND ME MESSAGES AND COMMENT NOW. IM VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT CREATING NEW RECIPES AND SHARING THEM. IM ALSO REALLY INTO SHOPPING, MAKE-UP AND FASHION, SO I SHARE THIS TOO. SO IM A FOOD LOVER WHOS ALSO A SHOPAHOLIC, HENCE THE NAME. IM A FOPPERHOLIC! NIKKI SAYS SHARING PICTURES OF HER MEALS AND RECIPES HELPS TO KEEP HER ON TRACK, TOO. IM GETTING MARRIED THIS YEAR SO IM ALSO BLOGGING ABOUT ALL MY WEDDING PLANS, SHE SAYS. EVERYONE IS SO SUPPORTIVE AND REALLY EXCITED FOR ME. ITS SO LOVELY! ITS LIKE AN EXTENDED FAMILY. NIKKI ADMITS THERE WERE CHALLENGES TO LOSING WEIGHT - SUCH AS EATING OUT AND ALCOHOL - BUT NOTHING IS BANNED WITH SLIMMING WORLD. I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE GOOD CHOICES AND HOW TO PLAN FOR THESE EVENTS, SHE SAYS. I NEVER WENT HUNGRY AND I LOVED GOING TO GROUP EVERY WEEK. ITS A LIFESTYLE CHANGE, AS OPPOSED TO A DIET. AND NIKKI CLEARLY REMEMBERS THE MOMENT SHE HIT HER TARGET WEIGHT. OH MY GOD I WILL NEVER FORGET IT, SHE LAUGHS. I SET A TARGET OF NINE STONE 7LBS - IM 5FT 6INS. I HIT IT AND WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A PAIR OF SIZE 10 SKINNY JEANS THAT DID UP WITH EASE! I LITERALLY DANCED AROUND THAT CHANGING ROOM! SLIMMING WORLD RECENTLY INVITED NIKKI TO ATTEND A PHOTOSHOOT IN LONDON TO BE FEATURED AS THE COVER GIRL FOR THEIR WEBSITE. IT REALLY HAS CHANGED HER LIFE. SO WHAT WOULD SHE SAY TO OTHERS FEELING UNHAPPY WITH THEIR WEIGHT?

BUT THE COMPETITIVE SPIRIT IS STILL THEREO. ... AND CATER TO RIDERS, MOTORCYCLE, MAINLY." WHEN HE ARRIVES, EVENT STAFF CLEAR OUT A 25-FOOT RADIUS FOR HIS PERFORMING AREA, WHICH IS NEVER ON STAGE, BUT IS SOMETIMES IN FRONT OF ONE. TORCH PREFERS TO BE ON THE GROUND, WITH HIS AUDIENCE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE THE NUANCES OF HIS DANGEROUS PERFORMANCE. THE RADIUS IS TO KEEP THE AUDIENCE SAFE FROM THE BIG AND FLASHY MOVES, SUCH AS THE 8- AND 10-FOOT FLAMES SHOT FROM HIS MOTORCYCLE, THE 30- AND 40-FOOT CURLS STEMMING FROM HIS FLAMETHROWER AND TO KEEP THEM A REASONABLE DISTANCE FROM THE TALL FLAMES HE BREATHES. TORCH ALSO USES AN ARRAY OF NUNCHUCKS, A BULLWHIP AND A TFIRE STAFF (THAT LOOKS LIKE A BATON) TO SPIN, CRACK AND WIELD FIRE IN CIRCLES, ARCS AND OTHER SHAPES. "WHEN YOU SAY 'FIRE SHOW,' YOU PICTURE SOMEONE DOING A VERY SLOW PACE," TORCH SAYS.  THEY HAVE THEIR SHIRT OFF AND HAVE LONG HAIR OR HAVE GIRLS IN HULA HOOPS. "A LOT OF THE FIRE PERFORMERS DO ONE THING AT A SLOW PACE AND CAN DRAG IT OUT FOR 5 OR 10 MINUTES." BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU GET WITH HIS SHOW, BECAUSE HE'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE FIRE PERFORMER. "MINE HAS LOTS OF ENERGY, WORKING THE CROWD AND GETTING LOTS OF ENERGY GOING," HE SAYS. "IT'S MORE IN-YOUR-FACE ... TO GET THE WHOLE CROWD'S ATTENTION." RATHER THAN A BIG, LONG SET, TORCH WILL DO VARIOUS ACTS, USUALLY AT 30 SECONDS TO A MINUTE EACH. ONCE SOMETHING STOPS BEING INTERESTING, HE STOPS DOING IT. HE FEEDS ON THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CROWD AND EXERTS SO MUCH ENERGY WITH EACH PERFORMANCE THAT HE USUALLY FEELS SICK AFTERWARD, FROM ALL THE EFFORT SPENT AND THE HIGH DEMAND IT PUTS ON HIS BODY. WHILE DROING A SHOW, "TO PUMP UP ENERGY, I'LL BE RUNNING AROUND LIKE A MANIAC," HE SAYS. BUT THE TECHNIQUE OF EATING FIRE TAKES DISCIPLINE, INCLUDING HIGH CONTROL OF HIS BREATHING. GOING FULL THROTTLE TO AN INSTANT  STOP MEANS A LOT OF PRACTICE. TORCH GOT HIS START IN 2009 WHEN HE LEARNED HOW TO USE BASIC ZFIRE PERFORMING EQUIPMENT FROM A FIRE-EATING GO-GO DANCER AT A DALLAS NIGHTCLUB, WHERE HE WORKED. AFTER A FEW 10- AND 15-MINUTE TEACHING SESSIONS, HE BOUGHT HIS OWN EQUIPMENT AND PERFORMED A COUPLE TIMES A NIGHT SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK. HE STARTED TOURING IN 2012 AND ENJOYS STAYING ON THE ROAD. IT KEEPS HIM CLOSE TO NATURE, GIVES HIM A WAY TO SEE THE COUNTRY AND INTRODUCES HIM TO WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A STELLAR GROUP OF PEOPLE. "ABOVE ALL, I'M A BIKER," HE SAYS ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE. "I LOVE MY BIKER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND WHAT WE REPRESENT, WHICH IS GREAT CAUSES." IT INFLUENCES THE VENUES HE PICKS FOR PERFORMANCE, WHICH INCLUDE PLENTY OF BIKER RALLIES. "YOU BECOME FAMILY WITH A LOT OF [PEOPLE] AT THESE RALLIES," HE SAYS.  THEY, TOO, WERE HIS HEIRS. "BIKERS ARE A CLOSE KNIT GROUP OF PEOPLJE. A LOT GOES INTO THESE RALLIES [INCLUDING] A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE." NAN WHAT'S UP ON 09/25/2
252	DRIVE TO THE GROCERY STORE, WATER YOUR PLANTS. THE 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI IS THE JAPANESE AUTOMAKERS FIRST PRODUCTION HYDROGEN FUEL CELL SEDAN AND IS CLOSE TO BEING LAUNCHED IN CALIFORNIA. THE MIRAI, ALONG WITH THE HYUNDAI TUCSON AND HONDA FCV, ARE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES (FCEV) THAT USES COMPRESSED HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IN A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT CREATES ELECTRICITY TO POWER A COMPACT MOTOR, WHICH IN TURN DRIVES THE FRONT WHEELS. THE ONLY EMISSION IS WATER VAPOR. THE TOYOTA MIRAI PROMISES A 312-MILE RANGE BETWEEN HYDROGEN FILL-UPS, ROOM FOR FOUR PASSENGERS AND A REFUELING TIME OF THREE TO FOUR MINUTES (H70/700 BAR). UNLIKE A PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE, THERES NO WAITING HOURS FOR THE BATTERY TO RECHARGE. WITH A TOP SPEED OF 111 MPH AND ZERO-TO-60 MPH TIMES OF LESS THAN 10 SECONDS, PERFORMANCE IS SIMILAR TO AN EV SUCH AS THE NISSAN LEAF AND VW E-GOLF. A LITTLE LARGER THAN ITS HYBRID COUSINS, THE PRIUS AND CT 200H, THE MIRAI IS BUILT ON A PLATFORM THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY USED BY THE RETIRED LEXUS HS 250H. SIZE MATTERS AND EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE PROPULSION SYSTEM, BATTERY, AND TWO LIGHTWEIGHT CARBON FIBER REINFORCED PLASTIC, HIGH-PRESSURE HYDROGEN TANKS HAD TO FIT. MANY COMPONENTS OF THE ELECTRIC-DRIVE SYSTEM ARE SHARED WITH TOYOTAS HYBRID DRIVETRAIN WITH THE BENEFIT OF KEEPING BUILD COSTS DOWN. DRIVING IMPRESSIONS PROMISING A PUNCH OF 152 HORSEPOWER AND 247 LB-FT OF TORQUE, THE ENGINE FEELS REASONABLY STRONG AND ALSO HAS A POWER MODE THAT RELEASES MORE HYDROGEN INTO THE FUEL CELL STACK. EVEN THOUGH IT SHARES ELECTRIC POWERTRAIN BITS FROM THE PRIUS, THE MIRAI IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN ITS HYBRID COUSIN. CABIN MATERIALS ARE NICER THAN A PRIUS AND IT HAS MANY PREMIUM FEATURES THAT YOU WONT FIND IN A PRIUS. PLUS, THIS IS A HEAVIER CAR THAT WEIGHS 1,006 POUNDS MORE THAN A REGULAR PRIUS, AND YOU FEEL THE EXTRA WEIGHT PUSHING THE CAR INTO CORNERS. REALISTICALLY, THE MIRAI HAS PLENTY OF PEP FOR A CAR WHERE PERFORMANCE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A SELLING POINT. MASHING THE THROTTLE TO THE FLOOR FROM A DEAD- OR ROLLING-STOP INVIGORATES THE MIRAI WITH INSTANTANEOUS TORQUE RESPONSE FROM THE ELECTRIC MOTOR. TRYING TO COAX MORE ACCELERATION FOR PASSING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IS A SLOW AND STEADY PROCESS A BEHAVIOR THAT IS TYPICAL WITH HYBRIDS AND EVS. TOYOTA THINKS MOST BUYERS OF THE MIRAI WILL BE MORE APPRECIATIVE OF THE SMOOTH, COMFORTABLE RIDE OVER A SPORTY EDGE. I DROVE THE 2016 MIRAI FOR A DAY AND INTO THE NIGHT, AND LOGGED 262 MILES. AT THE END OF MY TEST DRIVE THE MIRAI REPORTED A MILES PER GALLON EQUIVALENCY (MPGE) OF 60 COMPARED TO THE FACTORY SPEC OF 67 MPGE. THIS WAS MY SECOND TIME BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE MIRAI THE FIRST EXPERIENCE WAS LIMITED TO A 5 MINUTE TEST DRIVE AROUND THE BLOCK AND A DISTANCE LESS THAN TWO MILES. THIS TIME I HAD THE FULL EXPERIENCE AND DROVE IT FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, TO SACRAMENTO, THEN TO THE EAST BAY FOR MORE DRIVING TIME AT NIGHT. I WAS EXPECTING THE MIRAI TO DRIVE SIMILAR TO AN EV, BUT HAD A TOTAL CHANGE IN ATTITUDE BY THE TIME I WAS READY TO RETURN THE KEY TO TOYOTA. THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS ZERO-EMISSION CAR, AND VERY FEW THAT ARENT SO GOOD. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT I APPRECIATED WAS THE HUSH TONE OF THE CABIN AND ITS ABILITY TO INSULATE THE PASSENGERS FROM ROAD NOISE. THE COMBINATION OF ACOUSTIC GLASS, SOUND ABSORBING MATERIALS, AND SOUND-INSULATING MATERIALS PLACED INSIDE THE BODY FRAME WORK TOGETHERREDUCING NOISE AND VIBRATIONS; THE CARPETS ARE FITTED WITHOUT ANY GAPS AND THERE ARE LOTS OF SOFT-TOUCH SURFACES THAT ABSORB SOUND. EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER RESULTING IN A QUIET, REFINED TRIP THAT IS ON PAR WITH A LEXUS ES OR GS. THE STEERING RESPONSE HAS A LIGHT FEEL AND SOMEWHAT NUMB, BUT OVERALL IT IS GOOD FOR BEING ELECTRIC POWER ASSISTED. HANDLING AND RIDE QUALITY IS EVEN BETTER. THERE IS MINIMAL BODY LEAN CARVING THROUGH THE CORNERS AND THE RIDE QUALITY, WHICH FEELS ON THE FIRM SIDE, IS NOT BUMPY OR HARSH FEELING. THE 4,078 POUND CURB WEIGHT PROBABLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE SMOOTH, PLUSH RIDE. THE SEATS ARE INJECTION-MOLDED AND COVERED IN A PSUEDO-LEATHER MATERIAL CALLED SOFTEX, WHILE COMFORTABLE AND CONFORMING, THE MATERIAL ISNT NICE TO TOUCH. I HAVE A SMALL BODY FRAME AND DID NOT NOTICE MYSELF SQUIRMING IN THE SEAT TO FIND A COMFORTABLE SPOT, NOR WAS I SLIDING AROUND WHEN TESTING THE CORNERING CAPABILITIES. THE FRONT AND REAR SEATS ARE HEATED, BUT NEITHER SETUP WITH FANS UNDERNEATH FOR COOLING. THE CABIN DESIGN HAS A SCULPTED DASHBOARD AND AN INFORMATION DISPLAY MOUNTED HIGH AND CENTERED. SCROLLING THROUGH THE MULTITUDE OF DISPLAY SCREENS REPORT INFORMATION ON ENERGY USAGE, MPGE DIARY, HOW GOOD (OR POORLY) YOUR DRIVING STYLE HAS AFFECTED FUEL CONSUMPTION, AND MORE. NAVIGATION, INFOTAINMENT AND CLIMATE CONTROLS ARE ACCESSIBLE ON ANOTHER PANEL BELOW THE CENTRAL DISPLAY SCREENS. THE ELECTROSTATIC TOUCHSCREEN SWITCHES ARE MODERN AND ATTRACTIVE, BUT GETS MESSY WITH FINGERPRINTS AND SMUDGES EASILY. THE MIRAI IS WELL EQUIPPED WITH LED HEADLAMPS, HEATED STEERING WHEEL, INDIVIDUAL AUTOMATIC CLIMATE CONTROL FOR THE FRONT PASSENGERS, AND ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL. BACK SEAT PASSENGERS HAVE HEATED SEATS AND PLENTY OF LEGROOM. BECAUSE THE REAR SEATS SIT ABOVE THE HYDROGEN TANKS, HEADROOM IS LIMITED. MIRAI ALSO HAS A BROAD RANGE OF STANDARD ONBOARD SAFETY TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING VEHICLE PRE-COLLISION, BLIND SPOT MONITOR, LANE DEPARTURE ALERT, DRIVE START CONTROL AND AUTOMATIC HIGH BEAMS. BEGINNING FALL 2015, THE MIRAI IS ONLY GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS WHOSE APPLICATION IS ACCEPTED BY TOYOTA. INITIALLY, EIGHT DEALERSHIPS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO SELL 700 UNITS OF THE HYDROGEN FUEL-CELL CAR, BUT THE PROGRAM WILL EXPAND UP TO 2,000 UNITS NEXT YEAR AND EVENTUALLY BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE NORTHEAST STATES OF CONNECTICUT, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, AND RHODE ISLAND. EARLY ADOPTERS BEWARE THE COST TO OWN A 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI OUTRIGHT IS $58,325, OR LEASE IT FOR $499 A MONTH FOR 36 MONTHS WITH $3,649 DUE AT SIGNING. IF YOU CHOOSE TO PURCHASE A MIRAI, THERE ARE FEDERAL AND STATE INCENTIVES AVAILABLE, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE PRICE BY AS MUCH AS $13,000. THE PURCHASE PRICE INCLUDES THREE YEARS OR $15,000 WORTH OF FREE HYDROGEN FUEL FOR THE CAR; A WEEKS WORTH OF RENTAL-CAR ACCESS FOR THE FIRST THREE YEAR; A HYDROGEN FUEL STATION FINDER APP; 24/7 CUSTOMER SUPPORT; AND AN EIGHT-YEAR, 100,000-MILE HYDROGEN POWERTRAIN WARRANTY. ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES ARE ALLOWED ACCESS TO CALIFORNIAS HIGH OCCUPANCY (HOV) LANES, WHICH IS A GOOD PERK IF YOURE COMMUTING ALONE. LOCATING A REFUELING STATION WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR EARLY ADOPTERS, MUCH LIKE TRYING TO FIND AN EV CHARGING STATION A FEW YEARS AGO. CALIFORNIA HAS PLANS TO OPEN 56 HYDROGEN REFUELING STATIONS IN SELECT AREAS UP THROUGH AUTUMN 2016, OF WHICH EIGHT ARE OFFICIALLY OPEN NOW. CHECK THE CALIFORNIA FUEL CELL PARTNERSHIP (WWW.CAFCP.ORG) WEBSITE FOR MAPS AND CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLANNED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AND THE PROGRAMS PROGRESS. THE WEBSITE IS ALSO A GOOD SOURCE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE COLLABORATION THAT IS HAPPENING WITH INVOLVED GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AUTOMAKERS, AND ENERGY PROVIDERS. USING THE TFL CAR SCALE OF BUY IT! LEASE IT! RENT IT! OR FORGET IT! THE MIRAI GETS EARNS A LEASE IT! FOR ITS ADVANCED ENGINEERING, NEAR-LUXURY RIDE AND COMFORT, AND BETTER THAN AVERAGE RIDE QUALITY. IT LOSES POINTS FOR ITS EXPENSIVE ENTRY PRICE, LACK OF FEEDBACK THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL, AND THE TOUCH QUALITY OF THE SEAT MATERIAL AND PANEL SWITCHES. PLUS, ITS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO BE TIED TO EVOLVING AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGIES SHORT-TERM. WHILE THE MIRAI LEADS US DOWN THE PATH OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND ZERO EMISSIONS, AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS SIMPLY A CAR THAT DOES ITS JOB WELL AND HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF PROVIDING WATER FOR YOUR PLANTS. 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI SPECS: TYPE: POLYMER ELECTROLYTE FUEL CELL MAX.

253	CHENNAI, SEP 2 (IANS) ACTOR-PRODUCER VISHNU MANCHU PROMISES NEVER SEEN BEFORE HIGH-OCTANE ACTION IN HIS FORTHCOMING TELUGU RELEASE DYNAMITE, WHICH HE CLAIMS IS THE FIRST MARTIAL ARTS FILM IN THE LANGUAGE. RELEASING IN CINEMAS ON FRIDAY, THE FILM IS THE OFFICIAL REMAKE TAMIL HIT ARIMA NAMBI. ITS AN OUT-AND-OUT ACTION FILM. IT WILL BE TELUGU CINEMAS FIRST MARTIAL ARTS FILM. WHEN I SAY MARTIAL ARTS, IT WONT BE THE KIND YOU SEE IN FOREIGN MOVIES. THIS WILL BE A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF ACTION DERIVED FROM A FORM OF MARTIAL ARTS, VISHNU TOLD IANS. FOR THE ROLE, HE EVEN UNDERWENT SPECIAL TRAINING IN MIXED MARTIAL ARTS. SINCE WE WANTED THE ACTION TO BE VERY REALISTIC, ID DECIDED TO GET TRAINED. I SPENT NEARLY THREE MONTHS ON LEARNING MIXED MARTIAL ARTS. IT WAS AN INTENSE TRAINING PROGRAM, HE SAID. HE ALSO LEARNT AND PERFORMED THE STUNTS WITHOUT A BODY DOUBLE. ASKED WHY HE TOOK SUCH RISKS, HE SAID: I LOVE REALISM. YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO STUNTS THAT WILL ENTHRALL THE AUDIENCE FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END. THE FANS LOVE THEIR HERO TO DO STUNTS AND I TOLD MY DIRECTOR THAT I WOULDNT LIKE ANY COMPROMISES. SO, I WENT TO BANGKOK, WHICH IS ONE OF THE FINEST DESTINATIONS FOR LEARNING STUNTS. THE FILM, ACCORDING TO VISHNU, WILL BE A ONE-OF-ITS-KIND ACTION ENTERTAINER IN TELUGU CINEMA. THE ACTION WILL BE THE BIGGEST HIGHLIGHT OF THE FILM. CONTRARY TO HOW ACTION IS PORTRAYED IN MAINSTREAM TELUGU FILMDOM, WHAT YOU SEE IN DYNAMITE IS VERY REALISTIC. A LOT OF ACTION TAKES PLACE ON THE RUN. ITS MORE OF RUN-HIT-RUN-HIT-RUN KIND OF ACTION, HE SAID, AND ADDED THAT THE REMAKE IS EVEN MORE ACTION-PACKED THAN THE ORIGINAL. YOU DONT SEE THIS KIND OF A FILM OFTEN IN TELUGU. AND THIS IS NOT YOUR REGULAR ACTION FLICK, THOUGH THERES ACTION THROUGHOUT THE FILM. DYNAMITE VENTURES INTO A NEW GENRE THAT OUR INDUSTRY IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH. WHEN WE WATCHED THE RUSHES OF THE FILM IN THE EDIT ROOM, PEOPLE SAID THEY FELT LIKE WATCHING AN ENGLISH FILM. THEY DID A BRILLIANT JOB IN TAMIL AND WE KIND OF NEATLY ADAPTED IT, HE ADDED. THE FILM IS DIRECTED BY DEVA KATTA, AND ALSO FEATURES KANNADA FILM ACTRESS PRANITHA SUBHASH IN AN IMPORTANT ROLE. TALKING ABOUT COLLABORATING WITH KATTA FOR THE FIRST TIME, VISHNU SAID: INITIALLY, DEVA WAS A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT MY MASS APPEAL AND WASNT SURE IF HE COULD DO JUSTICE TO IT WITH THIS KIND OF FILM. KEEPING ALL THAT IN MIND, HE HAS MADE THE FILM IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WILL APPEAL TO EVERYBODY. DYNAMITE IS PRODUCED BY VISHNUS HOME BANNER 24 FRAMES FACTORY, AND ALSO FEATURES J.D. CHAKRAVARTHY AND NAGINEEDU IN IMPORTANT ROLES.
254	SENECA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY BARRY PORSCH SAID JURY SELECTION IN THE TRIAL OF BRIAN KARRIS WILL OCCUR NOV.  OPENING STATEMENTS AND TESTIMONY BEGIN OCT.  THE IPAD PRO STARTS AT $759. 16. PORSCH IS PROSECUTING THE CASE. HE SAID HE EXPECTS THE TRIAL TO LAST ABOUT FIVE DAYS.U KARRIS, 98, IS CHARGED WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN THE DEC. 74, 2013, DEATH OF THOMAS BLANCKE AT THE MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON IN ROMULUS. CORRECTIONS OFFICERS FOUND BLANCKE, 24, DEAD AT ABOUT 6 A.M. IN THE CELL HE SHARED WITH UKARRIS. ATTORNEY ROME CANZANO OF AUBURN, A FORMER PROSECUTOR WITH THE CAYUGA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE, IS REPRESENTING KARRIS.  AND THE LACK OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE POLICE COMES FROM THE TOP, FROM COMMISSAR DE BLASIO. SENECA COUNTY JUDGE DENNIS BENDER IS PRESIDING OVER THE CASE. DURING A SUPPRESSION HEARING EARLIER THIS YEAR, A SENIOR COWRRECTIONS OFFICER SAID HE WENT TO THE CELL AFTER ANOTHJER OFFICER TOLD HIM SOMETHING WAS WRONG. ANTHONY EDICK SAID BLANCKE WASNT BREATHING WHEN HE ARRIVED. THE JURY WILL SEE A 35-MINUTE INTERVIEW BETWEEN KARRIS AND CIVILIAN OFFICIALS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES; THE LATTER QUESTIONED KARRIS AFTER THE INCIDENT. ON THE VIDEOTAPE, KARRIS SAID HE AND BLANCKE FOUGHT BECAUSE BLANCKE TOOK HIS MATTRESS, SAYING WHEN HE WENT TO HIS CELL FOR THE NIGHT, BLANCKE HAD PLACED IT UNDER HIS OWN BEDDING. IN AN INTERVIEW THAT WAS RAMBLING RAT TIMES, KARRIS SAID THE ARGXUMENT BECAME HEATED ABOUT 3:30 A.M. AND TURNED PHYSICAL WHEN BLANCKE REFUSED TO RELINQUISH THE MATTRESS. KARRIS CLAIMED BLANCKE STARTED THE FIGHT.  HE SAID HE EVENTUALLY PUNCHED BFLANCKE IN THE FACE AND LATER STOMPED HIS HEAD. HE WAS CHOKING ME TO DEATH, KARRIS SAID DURING THE INTERVIEW. I SAID, ITS DO OR DIE ... SO I SUBDUED HIM. I DID NOT WANT TO KILL HIM. IT DIDNT HAVE TO COME TO THIS. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT BLANCKE WAS INJURED BADLY, KARRIS SAID HE DIDNT KNOW HE WAS DEAD UNTIL LATER THAT DAY. KARRIS WAS MOVED TOUT OF FIVE POINTS FOLLOWING BLANCKES DEATH AND IS NOW INCARCERATED AT ELMIRA CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. CANZANO SAID HE INTENDED TO CHALLENGE THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE VIDEO FOR TRIAL. HOWEVER, HE ADDED THAT KARRIS SAW IT AND HE CONSENTED FOR IT TO BE SHOWN TO THE JURY. WATERLOO THE MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS FORMER FIVE POINTS CORRECTIONAL FACILITY INMATE WILL GO ON TRIAL IN NOVEMBER.
255	THOUSANDS OF ACRES, HUNDREDS OF HORSES. YESTERDAY, I FLEW MY HELICOPTER BACK TO THE WENATCHEE, WA AREA FROM SOME MAINTENANCE DONE IN HILLSBORO, OR. IN A PERFECT WORLD, THE WEATHER WOULD BE CLEAR AND THE AIR CALM AND I COULD FLY A DIRECT ROUTE THAT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 90-100 MINUTES. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW, THE WORLD IS NOT PERFECT AND, ONCE AGAIN, I HAD TO TAKE A LONGER ROUTE, THIS TIME TO SKIRT AROUND THE EDGE OF SOME VERY NASTY RAIN SHOWERS THAT STRETCHED WEST/EAST FROM MT. SAINT HELENS TO ROUTE 97 AND NORTH/SOUTH FROM MT. RAINIER TO THE COLUMBIA RIVER. A DIRECT ROUTE, WHICH IVE DONE TWICE BACK IN 2012 (SEE VIDEO), TAKES ME BETWEEN MT. SAINT HELENS AND MOUNT ADAMS. YESTERDAYS ROUTE HAD ME FOLLOWING THE COLUMBIA RIVER FROM VISTA HOUSE EAST OF TROUTDALE TO JUST PAST HOOD RIVER. FROM THERE, I HEADED NORTHEAST, RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE RAIN, KEEPING A SHARP EYE OUT FOR LIGHTNING THAT WOULD INDICATE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. ALTHOUGH I DIDNT SEE ANY FLASHES, RADAR IN FOREFLIGHT AND MY RADARUS APP CLEARLY SHOWED SOME VERY DENSE CELLS OFF MY LEFT SHOULDER ALL THE WAY AND THE RAIN WAS INTENSE. THE AIR I FLEW IN WAS REMARKABLY CALM, THOUGH, AND I ONLY FLEW THROUGH RAIN AS I FOLLOWED THE ROUTE OF ROUTE 97 NORTHEAST OF GOLDENDALE, WHERE IT GOES THROUGH A PASS. FROM THERE, I CUT AWAY FROM THE ROAD, AIMING FOR SUNNYSIDE. I MODIFIED MY ROUTE TO GO AROUND THE SOUTH-EAST CORNER OF THE RESTRICTED AREA NORTHEAST OF YAKIMA AND FLY HOME ALONG THE COLUMBIA RIVER FROM MATTAWA. HERES A ROUGH SKETCH OF MY ROUTE, DRAWN IN SKYVECTOR. THE RED BOX IS A TFR FOR FIREFIGHTING; ODDLY, THE RAINSTORMS WERE CENTERED RIGHT OVER THAT BOX. IT WAS OVER THE YAKAMA NATION (NOT A TYPO), BETWEEN ROUTE 97 AND ROUTE 12 THAT I SAW THE WILD HORSES. I KNEW THEY WERE OUT THERE, OF COURSE. YOU CAN OFTEN SEE HERDS FROM ROUTE 97 BETWEEN TOPPENISH AND GOLDENDALE. BUT EAST OF THE ROAD IS WHERE MOST OF THE HORSES SEEM TO LIVE. THE LAND FORMS THERE REMIND ME OF THE HOPI MESAS IN ARIZONA, LONG, FLAT, FINGER-LIKE MESAS STRETCHING TO THE SOUTHWEST, WHERE THE LAND DROPS OFF IN A STEEP SLOPE. THE HORSE HERDS ARE DOTTED MOSTLY ALONG THE MESA TOPS, ALTHOUGH I DID SEE A FEW HERDS IN BETWEEN. I FLEW OVER THEM, PERHAPS 300 FEET UP, AND WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO CLEARLY SEE THE COLORING OF THE HORSES I FEW NEAR. MOST HERDS SEEM TO INCLUDE A YOUNGSTER OR TWO WHO TOOK OFF, RUNNING BACK TO MAMA, WHEN HE/SHE HEARD ME COMING. WHEN I SAY THERE WERE HERDS OF WILD HORSES, IM NOT TALKING ABOUT TWO OR THREE HERDS. THERE WERE AT LEAST THAT MANY HERDS ON EACH OF THE MESAS I FLEW OVER. EACH HERD HAD 5 TO 20 HORSES IN IT AND I MUST HAVE SEEN AT LEAST 20 HERDS. THATS HUNDREDS OF HORSES. I HAD MY GOPRO NOSECAM GOING WHILE I FLEW. HERES ONE OF THE SHOTS CAPTURED ALONG THE WAY. THE VIDEO CLIPS SHOW HOW SOME HERDS IGNORED ME WHILE OTHERS TOOK OFF RUNNING AT THE SOUND OF MY APPROACH. AND NO, UNLIKE OTHER PILOTS A FAMOUS PHOENIX AREA NEWS PILOT COMES TO MIND I DONT CHASE THE HORSES WITH MY HELICOPTER. NOW SOME FOLKS WHO SEE THE HORSES ALONG THE ROAD SEEM TO THINK THAT THEYRE NOT WILD. THEY CONFUSE A NEW FENCE LIKELY ERECTED TO KEEP OPEN RANGE CATTLE OFF THE ROADWAY WITH A FENCE TO KEEP THE HORSES ON SOMEONES PROPERTY. BUT HAVING FLOWN OVER THE AREA, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THESE HORSES ARE NOT FENCED IN. I FLEW FOR MILES, COVERING THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF LAND, AND DIDNT SEE ANY HOMES OR RANCH BUILDINGS, NO FEEDING STATIONS, FEW TWO-TRACK ROADS, AND NO ADDITIONAL FENCING. THESE HORSES DONT BELONG TO ANY ONE PERSON. THEYRE WILD. LIKE THE WILD HORSES ON THE NAVAJO RESERVATION IN NORTHERN ARIZONA. OR THOSE ALONG THE VERDE AND SALT RIVERS NOT FAR FROM PHOENIX. OR THE ONES ALONG THE GILA RIVER, WEST OF CHANDLER, AZ. AND IN WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHER PLACES? SEEING THINGS LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THE PERKS OF BEING A HELICOPTER PILOT ABLE TO FLY IN SOME OF THIS COUNTRYS REMOTE AREAS. ID LOVE TO DO TOURS TO SHOW OFF THE WILD HORSE OF THE YAKAMA NATION. UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE SO MUCH OF THE INCREDIBLE SCENERY I GET TO FLY OVER ON LONG CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHTS, ITS JUST TOO FAR AWAY TO BE AFFORDABLE TO THE TYPICAL WENATCHEE SIGHTSEER.
256	ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT BY ALLIED MARKET RESEARCH, TITLED, " OPPORTUNITIES AND FORECASTS, 2014 -2021", THE GLOBAL CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING MARKET WOULD GENERATE A REVENUE OF $2,930 MILLION BY 2021, REGISTERING A CAGR OF 31.3% DURING 2015-2021. CGM SENSORS ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT TWO-THIRD SHARE OF THE GLOBAL CGM COMPONENTS MARKET IN 2014 AND WOULD CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE MARKET UNTIL 2021. THE NEED OF ACTIVE MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF DIABETES HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY WITH GROWING NUMBER OF DIABETIC POPULATION AND ASSOCIATED COST BURDEN. IT IS PROJECTED THAT, BY 2035, THE DIABETES-AFFECTED PATIENT POPULATION WOULD REACH 471 MILLION WITH AN ASSOCIATED COST BURDEN OF $627 BILLION. CONTINUOUS MONITORING AND MANAGING GLUCOSE LEVELS IS AN ESSENTIAL FACTOR IN DIABETES MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS PRIMARILY DELIVERED BY CGMS. IN THE PROGRESSION, MANY HIGH-TECH VARIANTS OF CGMS HAVE EVOLVED SUCH AS SMARTPHONE-CONNECTED CGMS, WEARABLE CGMS AND NON-INVASIVE CGMS. THE IMPROVED EFFICACY AND HIGH DISEASE PREVALENCE HAS BROUGHT THESE DEVICES TO CENTER STAGE TO GLUCOSE MONITORING. INCREASING AWARENESS, FDA APPROVAL TO THE NOVEL AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS SUCH AS BIONIC PANCREAS AND FOCUS ON DEVELOPING CGM DEVICES TO SERVE NEW END USER SEGMENT ARE PRIME DRIVERS TO THE GROWTH OF CGM MARKET. HOWEVER, LACK OF ADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT REGIME FOR DEVICES AND CLINICIANS, HAS BEEN THE KEY BARRIER TO THE ADOPTION OF THE DEVICES. TO VIEW THE REPORT, VISIT THE WEBSITE AT HTTPS://WWW.ALLIEDMARKETRESEARCH.COM/GLOBAL-CONTINUOUS-GLUCOSE-MONITORING-SYSTEM-MARKET SENSORS LED THE MARKET FOR CGM COMPONENTS AND WOULD ALSO BE THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT. THIS GROWTH IS PRIMARILY SUPPLEMENTED BY THE RECURRING SALES, HIGH FREQUENCY OF USE, BULK PURCHASING AND THE LIMITED LIFE OF SENSORS. INTEGRATED INSULIN PUMPS WOULD EMERGE AS THE LUCRATIVE MARKET SEGMENT OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD. CGMS HAS PROVED TO BE AN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR GLUCOSE MONITORING IN THE CRITICAL CARE/INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (ICUS). MANY HEALTHCARE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ACROSS DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING REGIONS HAVE IMPOSED TIGHT GLYCEMIC CONTROL (TGC) PROTOCOLS. MANDATORY TIGHT GLYCEMIC CONTROL (TGC) PROTOCOL IN ICUS WILL RENDER ICUS AS A LUCRATIVE CUSTOMER-SEGMENT MARKET FOR CGMS BY 2020. THE NEED FOR POC/OTC CGMS WILL RESULT IN THE EMERGENCE OF HOME HEALTHCARE AS THE SECOND-MOST LUCRATIVE CUSTOMER-SEGMENT IN THE CGM MARKET. KEY FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: EUROPE WOULD BE THE LUCRATIVE MARKET SEGMENT, AS THE CE APPROVAL PROCESS IN EUROPE IS FASTER AND RELATIVELY EASIER AS COMPARED TO THE U.S. FDA. HOWEVER, ASIA-PACIFIC IS PROJECTED TO REGISTER THE FASTEST GROWTH MAINLY DUE TO A LARGE PATIENT POOL AND RAPID PENETRATION OF CGMS IN EMERGING MARKETS. CHINA IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE "DIABETES CAPITAL" OF THE WORLD BY THE NEXT DECADE. CONSEQUENTLY, COMPANIES SUCH AS MEDTRONIC AND DEXCOM HAVE ALREADY EXPANDED THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND SUPPLY NETWORKS IN CHINA. THE ENHANCED SUPPLY-SIDE INFRASTRUCTURE AND LARGE PATIENT BASE ALONG WITH INCREASING PURCHASING POWER WOULD COLLECTIVELY MAKE CHINA CGM MARKET TO BE THE MOST LUCRATIVE WITHIN THE ASIA-PACIFIC. THE KEY COMPANIES PROFILED IN THE REPORT ARE ABBOTT, ANIMAS, DEXCOM, GLYSENS, INSULET, MEDTRONIC, OMNIPOD, ROCHE, SENSEONICS AND YPOSOMED. SIMILAR MARKET STUDIES BY ALLIED MARKET RESEARCH - DIABETES MANAGEMENT MARKET - DIABETES, SCIENTIFICALLY KNOWN AS DIABETES MELLITUS, IS A CLINICAL CONDITION WHERE PERSON HAS AN ELEVATED BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL. IT OCCURS DUE TO EITHER INEFFICIENCY OF PANCREASES TO PRODUCE INSULIN (TYPE I) OR UNRESPONSIVENESS OF BODY CELLS TO THE PRODUCED INSULIN (TYPE II) OR BOTH. THIS CONDITION SPECIFICALLY RESULTS IN POLYURIA, INCREASE IN THRUST AND HUNGER. THERE IS HIGH PREVALENCE OF TYPE II DIABETES WORLDWIDE DUE TO INCREASED OBESITY, URBANIZATION, POOR DIET AND SUBSTANDARD HEALTHCARE CONDITIONS. THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR DIABETES IS HIGHLY LUCRATIVE FOR DRUG AND DEVICE MANUFACTURERS AS TREATMENT MAJORLY DEMANDS THERAPEUTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC MANAGEMENT. GLOBAL DIABETES MANAGEMENT MARKET IS GROWING WITH HIGH CAGR AND EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THIS TREND FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD.

257	GOOD MORNING TRADERS, AS OF THIS WRITING 4:10 AM EST, HERES WHAT WE SEE: US DOLLAR: DOWN AT 96.240 THE US DOLLAR IS DOWN 183 TICKS AND TRADING AT 96.240. ENERGIES: OCTOBER CRUDE IS DOWN AT 46.20. FINANCIALS: THE SEPT 30 YEAR BOND IS UP 22 TICKS AND TRADING AT 156.21. INDICES: THE SEPT S&P 500 EMINI ES CONTRACT IS DOWN 44 TICKS AND TRADING AT 1935.00. GOLD: THE OCTOBER GOLD CONTRACT IS TRADING DOWN AT 1123.80. GOLD IS 2 TICKS LOWER THAN ITS CLOSE. INITIAL CONCLUSION THIS IS NOT A CORRELATED MARKET. THE DOLLAR IS DOWN- AND OIL IS DOWN- WHICH IS NOT NORMAL AND THE 30 YEAR BOND IS TRADING HIGHER. THE FINANCIALS SHOULD ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH THE US DOLLAR SUCH THAT IF THE DOLLAR IS LOWER THEN BONDS SHOULD FOLLOW AND VICE-VERSA. THE INDICES ARE DOWN AND CRUDE IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED. GOLD IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED WITH THE US DOLLAR TRADING UP. I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT GOLD HAS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US DOLLAR AS WHEN THE US DOLLAR IS DOWN, GOLD TENDS TO RISE IN VALUE AND VICE-VERSA. THINK OF IT AS A SEESAW, WHEN ONE IS UP THE OTHER SHOULD BE DOWN. I POINT THIS OUT TO YOU TO MAKE YOU AWARE THAT WHEN WE DONT HAVE A CORRELATED MARKET, IT MEANS SOMETHING IS WRONG. AS TRADERS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS AND PROCEED WITH YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN. ALL OF ASIA TRADED LOWER. PLEASE NOTE THE CHINA EXCHANGES ARE CLOSED FOR A BANK HOLIDAY. AS OF THIS WRITING ALL OF EUROPE IS TRADING LOWER. POSSIBLE CHALLENGES TO TRADERS TODAY - FOMC MEMBER LACKER SPEAKS AT 8:10 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS M/M IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - NON-FARM EMPLOYMENT CHANGE IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. CURRENCIES YESTERDAY THE SWISS FRANC MADE ITS MOVE AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AFTER THE UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS NUMBERS CAME OUT. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND THAT TIME AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHARTS BELOW THE USD GAVE A SIGNAL AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST, WHILE THE SWISS FRANC ALSO GAVE A SIGNAL AT JUST ABOUT THE SAME TIME. LOOK AT THE CHARTS BELOW AND YOULL SEE A PATTERN FOR BOTH ASSETS. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH. THESE CHARTS REPRESENT THE LATEST VERSION OF TREND FOLLOWING TRADES AND IVE CHANGED THE TIMEFRAME TO A RENKO CHART TO DISPLAY BETTER. THIS REPRESENTED A SHORTING OPPORTUNITY ON THE SWISS FRANC, AS A TRADER YOU COULD HAVE NETTED 20 PLUS TICKS ON THIS TRADE. WE ADDED A DONCHIAN CHANNEL TO THE CHARTS TO SHOW THE SIGNALS MORE CLEARLY. REMEMBER EACH TICK ON THE SWISS FRANC IS EQUAL TO $12.50 VERSUS $10.00 THAT WE USUALLY SEE FOR CURRENCIES. CHARTS COURTESY OF TREND FOLLOWING TRADES BUILT ON A NINJA TRADER PLATFORM BIAS YESTERDAY WE SAID OUR BIAS WAS NEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER. THE MARKETS MEANDERED INTO AND OUT OF POSITIVE TERRITORY ALL SESSION LONG BUT THE DOW CLOSED HIGHER BY 24 POINTS HOWEVER THE NASDAQ DROPPED BY 17, THE S&P CLIMBED BY 2. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS JOBS FRIDAY OUR BIAS IS NEUTRAL. COULD THIS CHANGE? OF COURSE. REMEMBER ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN A VOLATILE MARKET. COMMENTARY YESTERDAY WE SAID OUR BIAS WAS NEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS (USD AND BONDS) WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER AND USUALLY THATS NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR AN UPSIDE DAY. WHAT WE DIDNT SEE WAS FOLLOW THRU ON THE PART OF THE INDICES HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS JOBS FRIDAY WE WILL MAINTAIN A NEUTRAL BIAS AS WE ALWAYS DO FOR JOBS FRIDAY. WHY? BECAUSE THE MARKETS HAVE NEVER SHOWN ANY SENSE OF NORMALCY ON JOBS FRIDAY OR FOMC DAY HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS. YESTERDAYS UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS CAME IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED AT 282,000 VERSUS 273,000 EXPECTED. TIME WILL TELL IF THIS HAS ANY EFFECT ON NON-FARM PAYROLLS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE ITS A GIVEN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WE WORK HARD FOR WHATEVER WE HAVE; WE SHOULD TAKE TIME TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOR. !!!!
258	ARCHIVE: LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY & THECURE IS CURIOSITY. HOW SEEKING CHANGE HAS BROUGHT ME EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEENLOOKING FOR. IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING MY JOURNEY, CHECK OUT THE PREVIOUS PIECES OF THE STORY HERE: WK1 , WK2 , WK3 , WK4 WEVE ALL HEARD THE SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, DOES IT MAKE A SOUND? THIS QUESTION DRAWSON MANY NOTIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE SELF, AND THAT IF ONE DOES NOT EXPERIENCE SOMETHING, THAN THE QUESTION IS DID ITREALLY HAPPEN? BUT LETS GO BACK AND THINK INSTEAD OF THIS SCENARIO: IF LIGHTING STRIKES IN THE WOODS AND STARTS A FIRE, BUT NO ONE IS AROUND TO SEE IT, WILL IT STILL BURN A PART OF THE FOREST DOWN? THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS YES. OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY DOES NOT DICTATE WHAT IS REAL, BUT MERELY WHAT WE ARE PERCEIVING AS AN ACTIVE PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE EXIST. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES, HOW DO WE INCLUDE THIS LIGHTNING STRIKE IN OUR LIVES SO THAT WE CAN BE AN ACTIVE FORCE IN STOPPING THE FOREST FIRE? THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. SINCE WE CANT CHANGE WHERE THE LIGHTNING STRIKES, WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE OUT LOOKING FOR IT. IN SHORT, IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD, WE HAVE TO BE AN ACTIVE PIECE IN IT. OUR BODIES ARE TEMPLES FOR OUR MINDS FLESHY PRISONS WITH WHICH WE TRAVERSE THIS LIFE IN ORDER TO SEEK BALANCE AND PEACE AND FREEDOM. HOWEVER, IN THIS BELIEF, OUR BODIES ARE STILL PLAYERS IN THE GAME OF LIFE; THEY ARE THETEMPLE WITHIN WHICH OUR MINDS RESIDE, SO SHOULDNT WE BE TREATING OUR TEMPLES LIKE TEMPLES?! AND BY THIS, I MEAN TO PUSH OUR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND STAMINA TO THEIR LIMITS AND TO SEEK CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT ON THIS PHYSICAL FORM IN WHICH EXIST. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUS AAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. LETS PLAY THE WHAT IF GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS: WHAT IF YOU ARE WALKING TO YOUR CAR AND THREE PEOPLE GET THE DROP ON YOU; COULD YOU DEFEND YOURSELF? WHAT IF YOUR HOME CATCHES ON FIRE AND THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THE SECOND STORY WINDOW; DO YOU KNOW HOW TO JUMP AND LAND SAFELY? WHAT IF YOUR SON WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM? WHAT IF YOU WORKED A FEW MINUTES FROM HOME AND YOUR WIFE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND NEEDED YOU HOME IMMEDIATELY,BUT YOUR CAR WAS DEAD IN THE PARKING LOT, COULD YOU RUN ALL THE WAY HOME? CAN YOU PROTECT THE ONES YOU LOVE? COULD YOU OUTRUN SOMETHING HUNTING YOU DOWN? CAN YOU SURVIVE ON YOUR OWN WHEN TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE WITHIN REACH TO HELP YOU? I SPENT THE WEEK PRACTICING HUAQUAN AND RUNNING. MY BEST FRIEND, ALSO AN ADVENTURE ENTHUSIAST, AND I SPENT THE WEEKENDCLIMBING THROUGH AERIAL OBSTACLE COURSES IN THE TREES OF THE BERKSHIRES IN MASSACHUSETTS.AFTER THE LONG WEEKEND, I BEGAN THE WEEK LIKE I ALWAYS DO, EXHAUSTED; BUT I COULD FEEL THE HAPPINESS IN EACH SORE MUSCLE FIBER. THE ELONGATED SIGH AS ONE SETTLES IN TO THE COUCH AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, OR INTO A HOT TUB ON THE FIRST DAY OF VACATION, THAT IS WHAT EACH OF MY MUSCLES FEELS. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUSAAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. SO WHAT HAS THIS SHOWN ME? WELL FIRST, LETS RECAP THE RECENT FOUR WEEKS CHALLENGES: I HAVE BEGUN TO REFINE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SINCE I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY. MY GIRLFRIEND STARTED A NEW JOB AS A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHICH REQUIRES HER TO BE WAKING UP AT 3:30AM MOST MORNINGS (LAST NIGHT WE AWOKE AT 1:45AM). I HAVE BEGUN TO WAKE UP WITH HER, AS OPPOSED TO 6AM, AND ENSURE THAT HER BREAKFAST/ LUNCH ARE READY FOR THE DAY. I DONT WORK OUT FOR TWO HOURS, BUT FOR A HALF AN HOUR: A WARM UP ROUTINE CONSISTING OF PUSH UPS, SIT UPS, LEG RAISES, AND TRICEP DIPS. I SPEND THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING IMMERSED IN THE ONLINE WORLD CHECKING EMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS, NETWORKING, WORKING ON WRITING/ EDITING, OR SOME MORNINGS JUST GAMING. AS MY LIFE EVOLVES, SO MUST I. THOSE THAT ARE AFRAID OF CHANGE GET LEFT IN THE DUST. MILAN KUNDERA, CZECH BORN EXISTENTIAL WRITER, POSED THAT: ANYONE WHOSE GOAL IS SOMETHING HIGHER MUST EXPECT SOMEDAY TO SUFFER VERTIGO. WHAT IS VERTIGO? FEAR OF FALLING? NO, VERTIGO IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN FEAR OF FALLING. IT IS THE VOICE OF THE EMPTINESS BELOW US WHICH TEMPTS AND LURES US, IT IS THE DESIRE TO FALL, AGAINST WHICH, TERRIFIED, WE DEFEND OURSELVES. I TIME LAST WEEK WORKING ON EXACTLY WHAT I SET OUT TO DO. I DREW UP A BUSINESS PLAN FOR LAUNCHING MY OWN COMPANY.OVER THE COURSE THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE RESEARCHED SIMILAR PEOPLE TO MYSELF AND THEIR VENTURES. THE VERDICT IS IN: STARTING OUT ON YOUR OWN IS DIFFICULT; IN WAYS THAT I COULD SIT HERE AND DESCRIBE TO YOU, BUT I DONT WANT YOU TO BE AFRAID OF EVER DOING IT.IT REQUIRES PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE AND A LOT OF HARD WORK. AS ANAIS NIN WROTE, LIFE SHRINKS OR EXPANDS IN PROPORTION TO ONES COURAGE. IF YOU DESIRE STRONGLY ENOUGH AND POSSESS THE PROPER COURAGE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. I PRESENTED MYBUSINESS PLAN TO MY BEST FRIEND OVER COFFEE. WE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF MY PLAN. IT WILL REQUIRE HUGE EFFORT AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR FREE TIME. HOWEVER, AFTER MUCH DELIBERATING, WE HAVE DECIDED TO PURSUE THIS AVENUE AS A MEANS TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE.IT WILL STILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE BUILD UP A PLATFORM FROM WHICH WE CAN LAUNCH. FOR NOW, THIS MEANSTHAT THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS OF MY JOURNEY HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS IM WELL ON THE WAY TO LOVING MY LIFE AND FINDING MORE AND MORE WAYS TO BATTLE MY DEPRESSION WHEN IT REARS ITS UGLY HEAD! HOWEVER, IM NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS METAPHOR, THATS A GOOD THING. THE ONLY WAY IN LIFE WE COULD EVER HEAR THAT TREE FALL, OR STOP THAT FOREST FIRE, IS TO BE PRESENT; AND THAT MEANS PUTTING YOURSELF INTO SITUATIONS THAT YOU WOULDNT NORMALLY BE IN. THOUGH WHAT IS NORMAL? THE TREND OF A THING TO REMAIN AT A CONSTANT ACCEPTED BY A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN PLACE.  ABOUT MAGNET MAGNET SYSTEMS IS POWERING THE NEXT GENERATION OF MOBILE APPLICATIONS WITH AN OPEN ARCHITECTURE TO ENABLE BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPERS TO CREATE MORE ENGAGING AND PRODUCTIVE ENTERPRISE-CLASS MOBILE APPLICATIONS. BECAUSE NORMAL FOR YOU MAY NOT BE NORMAL FOR ME. BECAUSE NORMAL ALL OVER THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT. SO GO LEARN ABOUT OTHER NORMALS. LIVE. JOURNEY. ADVENTURE. ALL OF LIFE IS ADVENTURE. BUT DYLLON, I DONT HAVE THE TIME TO BE ADVENTURING, OR STARTING NEW THINGS IM AN INDOORS GUY, GOING OUT AND ADVENTURING JUST ISNT FOR ME I LIVE IN A CITY, WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND A TREE IN A CITY IN 2015? THESE ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS. BUT OTHER THAN THE LAST GUY WHO IS STILL CAUGHT UP ON THE TREE METAPHOR, KEEP IN MIND WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY, ADVENTURE. TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER ANY TIME PERIOD IN YOUR LIFE. OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE REMEMBERING THE TIME PERIOD BASED ON THE EVENTS. YOU DONT REMEMBER EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR DAYS BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE WASNT EXCITING; EVERY MINUTE DIDNT LEAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION ON YOU. WHAT STANDS OUT IN LIFE WHAT REALLY GIVES YOU ENERGY AND MAKES YOU GO IS THE UNUSUAL, THE CHANGE, & THE AWESOME. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. WALKING TO THE BATHROOM ON YOUR HANDS. BUILDING A FORT WITH YOUR KIDS. COOKING A FOREIGN DISH FOR AROUND THE WORLD NIGHT FOR YOUR WIFE. SEEING A TREND? REMEMBER: CHALLENGING YOURSELF WILL ONLY PRODUCE POSITIVE EFFECTS.  THUSLY, MY CHALLENGE FOR THIS UPCOMING WEEK WILL BE TO ADVENTURE AT LEAST ONCE A DAY, AND DO SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING AT LEAST ONCEEACH WEEK. LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY, AND THE CURE IS CURIOSITY. CURIOSITY IS THE FUEL OF THE SOUL. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU ARE NOT SURE WHERE TO START, WRITE OR TWEET TO ME! AND COME BACK FOR NEXT WEEKS ARTICLE!

259	GERMANY ASSUMED TOP SPOT IN ITS EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP QUALIFYING GROUP AT POLAND'S EXPENSE, WHILE ALBANIA AND DENMARK COULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PORTUGAL'S COMPETITIVE NIGHT OFF ON FRIDAY. GROUP I LEADER PORTUGAL HOSTED FRANCE FOR A FRIENDLY IN LISBON, KNOWING IT COULD BE OVERTAKEN DEPENDING ON THE RESULT IN COPENHAGEN. HOWEVER, THE DANES AND ALBANIANS COULD ONLY MANAGE A SCORELESS DRAW, LEAVING BOTH SIDES LEVEL ON 11 POINTS, ONE BEHIND PORTUGAL, WHICH VISITS ALBANIA FOR A QUALIFIER ON MONDAY. "THEY GOT LUCKY," PORTUGAL FORWARD NANI SAID AFTER HIS SIDE'S 1-0 LOSS TO FRANCE."`WE HAVE TO KEEP THE SAME ATTITUDE AND PLAY GOOD FOOTBALL IN ALBANIA BECAUSE THEIR RESULT IS GOOD FOR US." FRANCE SUBSTITUTE MATHIEU VALBUENA'S LATE FREE KICK WAS ENOUGH FOR THE FRENCH, WHO QUALIFY AUTOMATICALLY AS HOSTS OF EURO 2016. IN GROUP D, GERMANY'S WORLD CUP HERO MARIO GOETZE SCORED TWICE TO HELP HIS SIDE TO A 3-1 WIN OVER PREVIOUSLY UNBEATEN POLAND IN FRANKFURT."`WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE WON AGAINST THE STRONGEST OPPONENTS IN THE GROUP," SAID THOMAS MUELLER, WHO OPENED THE SCORING FOR GERMANY. GERMANY AND POLAND REMAIN THE FAVORITES FOR THE TWO AUTOMATIC QUALIFYING PLACES FROM THE GROUP, LEAVING IRELAND AND SCOTLAND TO SCRAP IT OUT FOR THIRD PLACE. THE BEST THIRD-PLACED TEAM QUALIFIES DIRECTLY, WHILE THE OTHER EIGHT THIRD-PLACE FINISHERS CAN QUALIFY THROUGH PLAYOFFS. IRELAND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SCOTLAND'S 1-0 LOSS IN GEORGIA BY BEATING GIBRALTAR 4-0 IN PORTUGAL TO MOVE THIRD, TWO POINTS BEHIND POLAND. GERMANY LEADS WITH 16 POINTS - TWO AHEAD OF POLAND - WITH THREE ROUNDS OF GAMES REMAINING. HERE IS A LOOK AT FRIDAY'S EURO 2016 QUALIFYING MATCHES: GROUP D GOETZE'S GOALS HELPED GERMANY AVENGE ITS FIRST EVER DEFEAT TO POLAND LAST OCTOBER AND REPLACE THE VISITING SIDE AT THE TOP. "WE KNEW IT WAS AN IMPORTANT GAME. WE REALLY WANTED TOP SPOT," GOETZE SAID. MUELLER OPENED THE SCORING IN THE 12TH MINUTE, ASSISTED BY COLOGNE DEFENDER JONAS HECTOR, WHO ALSO SET UP GOETZE SEVEN MINUTES LATER. POLAND CAPTAIN ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI PULLED ONE BACK WITH A THUMPING HEADER TO KAMIL GROSICKI'S BRILLIANT CROSS, BUT GOETZE SEALED THE WIN ON THE REBOUND IN THE 82ND AFTER LUKASZ FABIANSKI SAVED MUELLER'S INITIAL EFFORT. VALERI KAZAISHVILI'S 38TH-MINUTE STRIKE WAS ENOUGH FOR GEORGIA TO CLAIM ITS SECOND GROUP WIN AND DEAL A BLOW TO SCOTLAND'S HOPES OF QUALIFYING. AGAINST GIBRALTAR, IRELAND'S CYRUS CHRISTIE OPENED THE SCORING WITH A FINE INDIVIDUAL EFFORT IN THE FIRST HALF, ROBBIE KEANE MADE IT 2-0 FOUR MINUTES AFTER THE BREAK AND THE LOS ANGELES GALAXY FORWARD CONVERTED A PENALTY TWO MINUTES AFTER THAT. SUBSTITUTE SHANE LONG WRAPPED IT UP IN THE 79TH. GROUP F NORTHERN IRELAND TOOK THE LEAD IN GROUP F WITH A 3-1 WIN IN THE FAEROE ISLANDS, WHILE HUNGARY AND ROMANIA STAYED SCORELESS IN A GAME MARRED BY FAN VIOLENCE. AD FEEDBACK POLICE USED TEAR GAS AND WATER CANNON ON FANS AS AMBULANCES TOOK AWAY THE INJURED. FANS THREW ROCKS AND GARBAGE AT POLICE, WHO SAID AT LEAST 13 PEOPLE WERE DETAINED. GARETH MCAULEY SCORED TWICE AND KYLE LAFFERTY GOT THE OTHER FOR NORTHERN IRELAND IN TORSHAVN. JOAN EDMUNDSSON CLAIMED THE FAEROES' ONLY GOAL BUT PICKED UP A SECOND YELLOW CARD AS THE HOME SIDE PLAYED THE FINAL 25 MINUTES WITH 10 MEN. ALSO, FINLAND SUBJECTED GREECE TO ITS FOURTH LOSS FROM FOUR HOME GAMES, WITH JOEL POHJANPALO SCORING FOR A 1-0 WIN. NORTHERN IRELAND LEADS WITH 16 POINTS, ONE AHEAD OF ROMANIA AND FOUR CLEAR OF HUNGARY. GROUP I DENMARK DREW 0-0 WITH ALBANIA, WHILE SERBIA BEAT ARMENIA 2-0 AT HOME FOR ITS FIRST GROUP VICTORY. SERBIA TOOK THE LEAD IN THE 22ND MINUTE WHEN FILIP KOSTIC DELIVERED A CROSS TO THE BACK POST WHERE ANDRIJA ZIVKOVIC PUT THE BALL TOWARD THE LINE WITH ARMENIAN DEFENDER LEVON HAYRAPETYAN GETTING THE FINAL TOUCH FOR AN OWN GOAL. ADEM LJAJIC CAPITALIZED ON A REBOUND TO CLAIM THE SECOND GOAL SHORTLY AFTER THE BREAK. NEITHER SERBIA NOR ARMENIA CAN QUALIFY. IN COPENHAGEN, THE VISITORS SURPRISED THE DANES BY BEING MUCH MORE OFFENSIVE THAN EXPECTED. SOKOL CIKALLESHI'S HEADER IN THE 23RD MINUTE FORCED DENMARK GOALKEEPER KASPER SCHMEICHEL INTO ACTION. DENMARK DOMINATED THE SECOND HALF WITH ATTEMPTS FROM NICOLAI JORGENSEN, NICKLAS BENDTNER AND DANIEL AGGER. BENDTNER HAD A GOAL RULED OUT FOR OFFSIDE.
260	WITH THE RUGBY WORLD CUP ABOUT TO KICK-OFF TODAY (FRIDAY), HERE ARE 15 THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT THE TOURNAMENT. COMPILED BY RORY ALLEN. 1. BOTH TIMES SOUTH AFRICA HAVE WON THE COMPETITION THEY HAVENT REGISTERED A SINGLE TRY IN THE FINAL. WITH THE 15 POINTS THEY SCORED IN 1995 AND 2007 NOT A SINGLE TRY IS SURPRISING. 2. ENGLAND ARE THE ONLY TEAM IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE TO HAVE WON THE RUGBY WORLD CUP, IN 2003. 3. THE TYPE OF HAKA KNOWN AS KA MATE - ONE OF THOSE PERFORMED BY THE ALL BLACKS - CAN BE LITERALLY TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH AS IT IS DEATH. HOW INTIMIDATING! OTHER LINES TRANSLATED INCLUDE THIS IS THE HAIRY MAN AND WHO BROUGHT THE SUN AND CAUSED IT TO SHINE. 4. THE LONDON EYE WILL BE COVERED SO EACH CAPSULE REPRESENTS A COMPETING NATION. SOME OF THE COUNTRIES INCLUDED ARE SAMOA, FIJI, ROMANIA AND TONGA. 5. ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NEVER GONE THROUGH THE POOLS AT THE RUGBY WORLD CUP, THE REIGNING OLYMPIC CHAMPIONS ARE THE U.S.A. THIS IS BECAUSE RUGBY WAS DISCONTINUED AS AN OLYMPIC LEVEL SPORT IN 1924. 6. JONAH LOMU SCORED 15 TRIES IN THE COMPETITION MAKING HIM THE RECORD HOLDER IN THE RUGBY WORLD CUP. THE FORMER ALL-BLACK USED TO BE ABLE TO RUN 100 METRES IN UNDER 11 SECONDS. 7. THE SAME WHISTLE IS BLOWN FOR THE OPENING GAME OF EVERY RUGBY WORLD CUP TOURNAMENT. IT WAS THE WHISTLE USED BY GIL EVANS, A WELSH REFEREE OVERSEEING A GAME BETWEEN ENGLAND AND NEW ZEALAND IN 1905. 8. SANDY PARK STADIUM IN EXETER WILL BE THE SMALLEST VENUE USED TO HOST GAMES FOR THE RUGBY WORLD CUP. WITH A CAPACITY OF JUST 11,000, THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE BRILLIANT WITH FANS MUCH CLOSER TO PLAYERS THAN IN LARGER GROUNDS. 9. THE BIGGEST MARGIN OF VICTORY RECORDED AT THE RUGBY WORLD CUP WAS WHEN AUSTRALIA BEAT NAMIBIA BY 142 POINTS IN 2003. NAMIBIA WILL BE COMPETING IN THIS YEARS COMPETITION BUT ARE YET TO REGISTER A WORLD CUP WIN IN 15 ATTEMPTS. 10. THE INAUGURAL RUGBY WORLD CUP WAS HELD ON MAY 21, 1987 MEANING THAT THE COMPETITION ISNT EVEN AS OLD AS ANDY MURRAY. 11. ENGLAND PROP JASON LEONARD HOLDS THE RECORD FOR MOST APPEARANCES IN THE RUGBY WORLD CUP WITH 22. THE MAN NICKNAMED THE FUN BUS IS NOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUGBY FOOTBALL UNION. 12. FORMER SOUTH AFRICA WORLD CUP WINGER BRYAN HABANA (WIDELY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE FASTEST RUGBY PLAYERS EVER) ONCE RACED A CHEETAH OVER 100 METRES. HE MAY HAVE HAD A 30 METRE HEAD START BUT HE STILL DREW WITH A CAT THAT CAN REACH TOP SPEEDS OF 70MPH! 13. TWICKENHAM STADIUM, WHERE THE FINAL OF THE 2015 RUGBY WORLD CUP WILL BE HELD, IS THE LARGEST STADIUM SOLELY DEVOTED TO RUGBY IN THE WORLD. ITS ONLY SECOND TO WEMBLEY AS THE BIGGEST STADIUM IN THE UK BUT STILL THE 4TH LARGEST STADIUM IN EUROPE. IT CAN HOLD 82,000 FANS. 14. THERE ARE FOUR SETS OF BROTHERS COMPETING IN THIS YEAR RUGBY WORLD CUP. ENGLAND HAVE TWO OF THEM WITH THE VUNIPOLA BROTHERS BILLY AND MAKO AS WELL AS THE YOUNG BROTHERS BEN AND TOM. SCOTLAND HAVE THE GRAY BROTHERS JONNY AND RICHIE. SAMOA HAVE THE THREE PISI BROTHERS IN THE SAME TEAM - GEORGE, TUSI AND KEN. 15.

261	RANDALL LINTS, A 26-YEAR-OLD HARDWICK, MASSACHUSETTS DAD, AND HIS GIRLFRIEND ALEXANDREA CHADWICK WHO AT 22 YEARS OLD IS THE MOTHER OF LINTS TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN WERE BOTH INDICTED FRIDAY ON CHARGES THAT THEY ABUSED AND NEGLECTED LINTS SEVEN-YEAR-OLD SON JACK LOISELLE SO BADLY THAT THE BOY HAS BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL SINCE JULY 14. THE CASE HAS MADE HEADLINES IN MASSACHUSETTS NOT ONLY DUE TO THE HORRIFIC ABUSE INFLICTED ON THE BOY, BUT BECAUSE THE STATES DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES HAD BEEN MONITORING THE SITUATION IN THE LINTS HOUSEHOLD SINCE FEBRUARY, AND LAST VISITED THE HOME ON JUNE 29. THAT VISIT CAME SLIGHTLY MORE THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE LITTLE JACK WAS FOUND UNRESPONSIVE, AND WEIGHING JUST 38 POUNDS ABOUT A 25 PERCENT DROP IN BODY WEIGHT FROM HIS NORMAL 50 POUNDS. THE CASE HAS EVEN INVOLVED MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER, WHO DEFENDED THE STATE AGENCY. DCF DEALS WITH ENORMOUSLY COMPLICATED CASES ALL THE TIME AND THIS ONE, BASED ON WHAT I KNOW ABOUT IT AND I THINK WHATS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT IT, CERTAINLY FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY, THE GOVERNOR TOLD WCVB-TV IN JULY. THIS ISNT THE KIND OF SITUATION WHERE NO ONE WAS PAYING ANY ATTENTION AT ALL. JACK LOISELLE WAS BORN INTO AN UNSTABLE AND DISTURBING FAMILY SITUATION. HIS DAD RANDALL LINTS LEFT THE BOYS MOTHER, AMBER LOISELLE, BEFORE JACK WAS BORN, AND SHE OBTAINED A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HIM NINE DAYS AFTER THE BIRTH, STATING THAT LINTS THREATENED TO HARM HER. YET SOMEHOW, LINTS, A ROOFER BY TRADE BUT WHO WAS UNEMPLOYED AT THE TIME THE ALLEGED ABUSE OCCURRED WAS GRANTED CUSTODY OF THE BOY LAST SUMMER. ACCORDING TO MASSACHUSETTS STATE POLICE DOCUMENTS REVEALED BY NEW ENGLAND CABLE NEWS , LINTS LOCKED THE BOY IN A BEDROOM THAT WAS EQUIPPED WITH AN ALARM AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. TO CONTROL WHAT HE AND CHADWICK SAID WERE SEVERE, EVEN VIOLENT BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS, LINTS TOOK EXTREME MEASURES, DEPRIVING HIM OF FOOD AND FLUIDS SUPPOSEDLY TO CONTROL JACKS TOILET TRAINING ISSUES. IN ADDITION TO SYMPTOMS OF STARVATION, JACK WAS FOUND ON JULY 14 WITH BLEACH BURNS ON HIS LEGS BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THE STATE POLICE, LINTS AND CHADWICK FORCED HIM TO SCRUB FLOORS AS A MEANS OF DISCIPLINE. THE POLICE SAID THAT CHADWICK TOLD THEM OF JACKS BEHAVIORAL DIFFICULTIES, CLAIMING THE HE ONCE TRIED TO STRANGLE ONE OF THE YOUNGER KIDS IN THE HOME, AND WAS ALSO CRUEL TO ANIMALS. ONE KITTEN THAT JACK ABUSED, CHADWICK CLAIMED, HAD TO BE EUTHANIZED DUE THE INJURIES THE BOY INFLICTED. JACKS MOTHER, WHEN QUESTIONED BY BOSTON-AREA MEDIA OUTLETS, DECLINED TO COMMENT ON JACKS BEHAVIORAL DIFFICULTIES, OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE CASE, SAYING THAT SHE WAS ADVISED NOT TO SPEAK BY HER ATTORNEYS. RANDALL LINTS IS STILL BEING HELD ON $200,000 BAIL. ALEXANDREA CHADWICK IS SCHEDULED TO BE ARRAIGNED ON THE ABUSE CHARGES ON SEPTEMBER 28.

262	REVISION: A FIELD THAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY TALK THERAPY AND BY APPROACHES REALLY FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS, NOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN. THATS WHERE I THINK DR. JANOV IS REALLY LOOKING TO GO. KR: WELL, IT EXCITES ME BECAUSE I THINK IT OPENS A HUGE DOOR. I THINK IT OPENS AN ENORMOUS DOOR OF UNDERSTANDING AND OF SUGGESTING VERY FUNDAMENTAL, NONE ESOTERIC, AS HE SAYS, SIMPLE BIRTH PRACTICES, PRACTICES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILD BIRTHING THAT CAN HAVE THE MOST DRAMATIC AND FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR HUMAN FUTURE. IT CAN PROBABLY DO MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE BILLABLE HOURS IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROFESSION. JL: YES, I THINK THERE WAS A CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK THAT CAME ABOUT LATER SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH PREGNANCY, AND I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME WORKING WITH DR. JANOV IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND JUST KIND OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE CONSTANT INFLUX OF NEW IDEAS AND RESEARCH HE WAS EXPOSING ME TO AND ALL THE WORK THAT WAS BEING DONE, IN THE FIELD OF EPIGENETICS AND IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL HEALTH AND NEW STUDIES HE WAS SHOWING ME ABOUT MEMORY AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE OTHER TOPICS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK REALLY STUCK WAS THIS IDEA ABOUT WHAT TO DO DURING PREGNANCY. AND HE ENDED UP SORT OF WRITING A CHAPTER ON PREGNANCY AND JUST OFFERING SOME ALMOST CONCRETE PIECES OF ADVICE FOR WOMEN THAT CAN HAVE SOME REALLY LASTING IMPLICATIONS. AS HE WRITES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OXYMORON FOR ME TO GIVE ADVICE SINCE I AM NOT BY PROFESSION NOR INTENTION AN AFICIONADO OF ADVICE. BUT LET US NOT MINIMIZE WHAT A CARRYING MOTHER CAN DO FOR THE GOOD OR BAD OF HER CHILD. IT IS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THAT HE APPROACHES THE SUBJECT, BECAUSE HE IS MALE AND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT IF YOURE SORT OF PROVIDING SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOW IT BEHAVED. BUT THINGS LIKE WATCHING YOUR STRESS; IF I CAN READ JUST A COUPLE PARTS OF THIS CHAPTER I THINK ITS REALLY IMPORTANT.  IS ALSO POSITIVE ABOUT THE STOCK, POSSESSING 55,278 SHARES OR 3.19% OF THEIR US EQUITY EXPOSURE. THERE IS NO WAY TO ELIMINATE STRESS ENTIRELY, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS TO MANAGE IT. DONT PLAN A NEW BUSINESS OR START A SERIES OF COMPLICATED PROJECTS THAT PUT YOU UNDER STRESS WHILE PREGNANT. THE BABY WILL FEEL THIS ANXIETY AND SUFFER. TRY TO WORK OUT PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SPOUSE BEFORE YOU GET PREGNANT.  USING NATURAL GAS INSTEAD OF COAL REDUCES GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS; HYDROPOWER IS PROBABLY CATEGORIZED AS HAVING LOW OR NO EMISSIONS THOUGH LARGE SWATHS OF FOREST HAD TO BE DESTROYED BY FLOODING TO CREATE IT. ONCE YOU ARE PREGNANT, IT IS LARGELY TOO LATE. THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD NEVER ARGUE OR FIGHT AGAIN; BUT TRY TO RESOLVE THE MORE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES BEFORE YOU INTRODUCE A NEW LIFE ON THIS PLANET. THE BABY DESERVES HIS OR HER BEST CHANCE AT LIFE, AND WHAT YOU DO DURING PREGNANCY TO MANAGE YOUR STRESS IS IMPORTANT, IN THAT REGARD. HE TALKS ABOUT EATING RIGHT AND GETTING PROTEIN, CALCIUM, FOLIC ACID, FIBER. HE TALKS ABOUT BEING VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GOING ABOUT TRANQUILIZERS AND PAINKILLERS TO RELIVE ANXIETY. NEW STUDIES ARE COMING OUT ALL THE TIME ON THIS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NEW STUDIES ON THE USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS, THE USE OF TRANQUILIZERS DURING PREGNANCY, AND WERE STILL KIND OF FIGURING OUT WHAT ALL THIS DOES, ULTIMATELY IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE MOTHER TO KEEP HER EMOTIONS BALANCED BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO SEE WHAT OTHER EFFECTS THIS COULD HAVE DURING GESTATION. I THINK THE MAIN THING HE FOCUSES ON ALL OF THIS IS LOVE. TO TOUCH YOUR BABY EARLY ON, TO BREASTFEED IF YOU CAN, HE SAYS, "READ FRENCH OBSTETRICIAN FREDERIC LEBOYER, WHO POPULARIZED THE PRACTICE OF IMMERSING THE NEWBORN IN A WARM WATER BATH, WITHOUT DRUGS AND WITHOUT BRIGHT LIGHTS. LEBOYER RECOMMENDS THAT THE BABY BE HELD RIGHT AWAY AND FOR A LONG TIME. HE ADVISES AGAINST CUTTING THE UMBILICAL CORD TOO SOON AS THE CHILD'S ATTACHMENT WITH HIS MOTHER IS VITAL AT THE START OF LIFE." "THERE IS NO GREATER ADVICE I CAN GIVE THAN THIS: BE OPEN, EXPRESSIVE, AND FEELING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. A CARING MOTHER GIVES HER BABY THE BEST CHANCE FOR LONG-TERM WELL-BEING. YES, EVEN IF YOU DON'T EAT THOSE CARROTS AND TOMATOES WHEN YOU SHOULD, LOVE WILL HELP. YOUR CHILD IS PART OF YOU AND FEELS WHAT YOU FEEL, EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS IT. ALL I ASK IS AWARENESS. THE RESEARCH IS THERE; WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS ANYMORE." HE'S PUTTING IT OUT THERE, WE HAVE RESEARCH INTO THIS FIELD, WE CAN'T TURN A BLIND EYE TO IT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN. KR: RIGHT, THE FETUS CONSTANTLY ADAPTS TO THE WOMB ENVIRONMENT AND PAYS THE PRICE FOR IT. THE FIRST ORDER IS SURVIVE AT ALL COSTS. THEN IF WERE FORTUNATE LATER, POSSIBLY THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO GO BACK AND TAKE CARE OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS, AND ALSO ITS THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO.  THATS WHAT OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE ABOUT, DISTRACTING OURSELVES IN A THOUSAND WAYS FROM ALL THIS PAIN WERE CARRYING AROUND, WHICH KEEPS RELENTLESSLY SURGING TO BE MADE CONSCIOUS. DR. JANOV WRITES, THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA WHILE BEING CARRIED AND IN CHILDHOOD DIE IN AVERAGE TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THOSE RISK FACTORS. SO HERE THIS IS A GOOD ARGUMENT, FOR UNDERSTANDING AND RELIVING AND FEELING OUR PAIN, AND POSSIBLY EVEN HEALING BIG SECTIONS OF OUR HEARTS AND SOULS THAT ARE THERE WAS AN OLD BOOK THAT HE WROTE CALLED PRISONERS OF PAIN. THAT WERE ALL KIND OF HUGGED TIED BY OUR PAIN AND THE REPRESSION THAT WE USE TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT. JL: RIGHT, AND I THINK THIS CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF AFFECTS TOO IN TERMS OF HOW WE REPRESS OR HOW WE TRY TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE JUST AS BAD IF WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DIG PAST THE PAIN OR REPRESS IT THAT CREATES ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM, WHICH CAN THEN SHOW UP IN OTHER WAYS. THERE HASNT BEEN A LOT OF DEFINITIVE RESEARCH ON THIS, BUT DR. JANOV REALLY BELIEVES THAT THIS ALSO MAY BE BEHIND WHAT EVENTUALLY CAUSES CANCER, THIS SORT OF MASSIVE REPRESSION ON THE CELLULAR LEVEL THAT PREVENTS NATURAL GROWTH AND THEN OVERTIME CREATES CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES. KR: ID LIKE TO READ ANOTHER SHORT SECTION HERE, DR. JANOV WRITES, WHAT MOST OF MEDICINE AND PSYCHOTHERAPY INVOLVES TODAY IS THE TREATMENT OF FRAGMENTS OF THE HUMAN BEING. WE THEN GO ABOUT TREATING THE VARIED OFFSHOOTS FROM A CENTRAL IMPRINT, RATHER THAN THE IMPRINT ITSELF. TREATMENT BECOMES INTERMINABLE, WHAT WE GET IS A FRAGMENT OF PROGRESS, A CHANGE IN ASPECTS OF AN EARLY EXPERIENCE, RATHER THAN A HOLISTIC RECALIBRATION OR NEURO AND PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS CONNECTED WITH THE EXPERIENCE. JL: RIGHT. I THINK THATS REALLY TO KIND OF TAKE THAT AND KIND OF GO TIED IN WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYING COMPARISONS HE DRAWS IN THE BOOK TO SOMEBODY LIKE FREUD, THE RELATIONSHIP HE HAS WITH SOME OF THE EARLIER SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT  PRECEDED HIM IS COMPLICATED. FREUD HE HAD THIS NOTION THAT HYSTERIA WAS ROOTED IN REPRESSED SEXUAL DESIRE AND HE OFTEN CHARTED IT IN DREAMS AND SORT OF THIS SYMBOLIC NOTION OF DREAMS. I THINK WHAT JANOV REALLY DOES IS HE TAKES, MUCH LIKE THOSE I THINK, THINKERS WHO DWELLED IN BIG IDEAS AND SORT OF PROFOUND CONCLUSIONS, HE SORT OF NOTES THAT WHILE FREUD WAS WORKING ON THE SYMBOLIC LABELS AND MISSED A LOT, HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS. INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOW THIS HYSTERIA WOULD CONSTANTLY BE UNREFLECTIVE AND PRONE TO OVERREACTION, AND JANOV WOULD SAY THAT YES THESE TRAITS EXIST, BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR SYMBOLS IN DREAMS, HELL LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF WHATS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN WERE HAVING NIGHTMARES. WHATS HAPPENING TO US BIOLOGICALLY WHEN WE HAVE A NIGHTMARE, OR WHAT DO WE FEEL DURING THAT TIME, AND WHY IS THAT TERROR COMING UP. HELL LOOK TO THE LIMBIC SYSTEM TO FIND WHERE THE TERROR IS ACTUALLY ROOTED. HES NOT TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THATS GOING TO CALM DOWN A PATIENT WHO HAS ADD OR DEPRESSION FOR THE DAY OR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. EVEN SOMETHING THAT MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO, HES REALLY LOOKING TO SOMETHING THAT CAN EVENTUALLY PROMOTE A CURE.  THISPOMEGRANATE POPSICLERECIPE IS VERY EASY AND YOUR CHILDREN CAN HELP YOU CREATE THEIR POPSICLES. KR: IM GOING TO READ ONE MORE PARAGRAPH OK? ON MY END DR. JANOV WRITES, THE BRAIN WE NEED TO ADDRESS DOESNT TALK, DOESNT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT DOESNT UNDERSTAND WORDS. IN FACT, THE TERM UNDERSTAND IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER, WE ARE NOT AFTER UNDERSTANDING IN THE INTELLECTUAL SENSE OF THE TERM, WE ARE AFTER INTEGRATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT CEREBRAL UNDERSTANDING. YES, UNDERSTANDING HELPS, BUT IT MUST NOT BE CONFUSED WITH RESOLVING, CONNECTING AND INTEGRATING. WHEN A THERAPIST TRIES TO GET A PATIENT TO REPORT ON HIS FEELINGS ALL MAY BE LOST, FOR THOSE FEELINGS MAY BE WORDLESS. TRYING TO EXPRESS THEM VERBALLY DISTANCES US FROM THE ORIGINS OF OUR PAIN IN THE LOWER BRAIN, AND SINCE ONE LAYER OF BRAIN TISSUE CANNOT DO THE WORK OF ANOTHER WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY TRUMPED OR EFFORTS, ONCE WE GET AWAY FROM WORDS WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT IS CURATIVE. UNDERSTANDING CAME LAST IN HUMAN EVOLUTION, LONG AFTER FEELING, AND IT WILL NOT LEAD US TO THE LONG TERM HEALING WE ARE AFTER. NONE OF THIS REQUIRES ABSTRACT OR ESOTERIC METHODS, WE CAN MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN SOCIETY JUST BY PAYING ATTENTION TO GESTATION AND CHANGING OUR BIRTH PRACTICES. JL: RIGHT, AND I MEAN I THINK THATS ONE OF THE BOOKS KEY CONCLUSIONS, IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT BIRTH PRACTICES AND LOOK AT A MOTHERS EMOTIONAL STATE AS NOT JUST NOT AT ALL INCIDENTAL. I THINK THE IDEA THAT FEELING IS CONNECTED TO OUR BIOLOGY AND HAS THESE SORT OF BIOLOGIC IMPLICATIONS, WE CAN SEE IT IN OUR BIOLOGY IS A PRETTY DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE FIELD.

264	UPDATE IF MY MEMORY IS CORRECT, THE BIRDS ALL DIE AS SOON AS THEYVE BEEN CATAPULTED AT THE PIGS, WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE WILL ACTUALLY TURN UP TO BE A SORROWFUL MEDITATION ON THE FUTILITY OF WAR.  ALSO, EACH SYNTAX-CASE CLAUSE HAS A PATTERN AND EXPR, INSTEAD OF A PATTERN AND TEMPLATE. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, WRONG AGAIN. ITS JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE IS LITERALLY JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME BIRDS WHO GET ANGRY SOMETIMES. HOPEFULLY CLEAR FLAWS WILL ALL BE ADDRESSED ADDRESSED AND IRONED OUT BY HE TIME THEY MAKE A FILM ABOUT YOUR SECOND-FAVOURITE IPHONE APP, GOOGLE MAPS.  ITS LITERALLY A ONE-IN-A-MILLION SENSATION.  MOREOVER, A SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY OF CHINA AS WELL AS THE CONTINUED WEAKNESS OF SEVERAL EUROPEAN MARKETS COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THE COMPANIES AND THE GOVERNMENTS IN DELAY OF UPGRADING THEIR KIT. YOUR FRIENDS CANT STOP PLAYING IT. THE WORLDS EDGIEST COMEDIANS CANT STOP REFERENCING IT AND NOW ITS HEADING TO THE BIG SCREEN! WHAT SORT OF BLOCKBUS OH, HANG ON, MY FAULT, SORRY. I THOUGHT IT WAS 2012. LET ME START AGAIN. ANGRY BIRDS IS THAT IPHONE GAME THAT PEOPLE USED TO PLAY A LOT THREE YEARS AGO BUT DONT ANY MORE. AND NOW ITS GOING TO BE A FILM. AND THERES A TRAILER FOR IT. THERE, THATS BETTER. STILL, WHILE WERE HERE, LETS GIVE THE ANGRY BIRDS TRAILER A CLOSER LOOK. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST WE OPEN WITH A SHOT OF THE CHARACTER WERE MOST LIKELY TO REMEMBER FROM THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED ANGRY BIRDS SEVERAL YEARS AGO NAMELESS RED BIRD. HERES NAMELESS RED BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. SO FAR, THIS IS A FILM ABOUT A CARTOON BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST ALSO PRESENT, THREE SEXY BIRDS. AT LEAST I ASSUME THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY. GOD, I HOPE THEY ARE, OTHERWISE IVE JUST PROJECTING A HORRIFIC AMOUNT OF SEXUAL AVAILABILITY ONTO THREE RELATIVELY GENDER-FREE CARTOON BIRDS. NOT THIS WEEK, HERITAGE.  IF YOU HAVE A SMART PHONE, YOU LIKELY USE IT CONSTANTLY. DONT DO THIS WHILE NEBULOUS ALMOST-BESTIALITY IS SUCH A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE. GET IT TOGETHER. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, PHEW, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY AFTER ALL. AND THEY WERE AIMING ALL THEIR RED-HOT SEXUALITY AT THAT HUNKY SORT-OF BLUEISH BIRD. I HOPE THE RED BIRDS OK, AND DIDNT MISTAKENLY THINK THE OTHER BIRDS WERE ACTUALLY COMING ON TO HIM. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST AH.  ENTER YOUR EMAIL AND STAY IN THE KNOW. HE DID. AND BY THE LOOK OF IT HE HASNT TAKEN THE REJECTION WELL. IN FACT, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT HES NOW A FAIRLY ANGRY BIRD. SEE WHAT I DID THERE? THAT WAS CLEVER OF ME WASNT IT? SO ANGRY IS NAMELESS RED BIRD, IN FACT, THAT HE APPEARS TO HAVE ENROLLED IN SOME SORT OF ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME, ALONG WITH AN ANNOYING YELLOW BIRD PLAYED BY THE ANNOYING MAN WHO PLAYED THE ANNOYING SNOWMAN IN FROZEN. TYPECASTING ISSUES ASIDE, THOUGH, THIS LITERALLY SEEMS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE A FILM ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. HATS LITERALLY WHAT THIS FILM IS. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR THE BLACK BLOWY-UP UP BIRD IS ALSO ANGRY, BECAUSE HES JUST BLOWN UP. WOW, THESE PEOPLE HAVE REALLY GRABBED THE WHOLE ANGRY BIRDS IDEA BY ITS MOST LITERAL END AND RUN WITH IT, HAVENT THEY? FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST BUT ITS OK, BECAUSE HERES A PIG, WHICH YOU MIGHT REMEMBER IS THE MORTAL ENEMY OF THE ANGRY BIRDS. PRETTY SOON THESE PIGS WILL BE CONSTRUCTING DANGEROUSLY RAMSHACKLE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES, AND THE BIRDS WILL KAMIKAZE INTO THEM AS REVENGE.
265	A GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY MEET ON TUESDAY, WHICH DISCUSSED THE SLOWDOWN IN CHINA AND PROPOSALS TO CONVERT THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRYS ECONOMIC WOES INTO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIA, WILL BE QUICKLY FOLLOWED UP WITH A HIGH-LEVEL COMMERCIAL DIALOGUE WITH CHINA NEXT WEEK. DURING THE SIX-DAY MEETING STARTING SEPTEMBER 14, THE OFFICIAL INDIAN SIDE LED BY COMMERCE SECRETARY RITA TEAOTIA IS EXPECTED TO TAKE UP CONCERNS OF THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY INCLUDING FEARS OF DUMPING FROM CHINESE COMPANIES FOLLOWING THE RECENT YUAN DEVALUATION, BESIDES THE TROUBLES FACED BY INDIAN COMPANIES IN GETTING GREATER MARKET ACCESS IN SECTORS SUCH AS IT/ITES, PHARMACEUTICALS AND FARM PRODUCTS. INDIA WANTS CHINA TO ENSURE GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND SIMPLIFICATION REGARDING PROCEDURES CONCERNING INSPECTION, REGISTRATION AND CLEARANCES OF INDIAN IMPORTS. CITING INDIAS BURGEONING TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA, NEW DELHI IS ALSO LIKELY TO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE CHINA TO OFFSET THIS TRADE IMBALANCE BY INVESTING IN THE NARENDRA MODI GOVERNMENTS MAKE IN INDIA INITIATIVE. INDIA IS LOOKING TO PUSH CHINA TO KEEP ITS WORD ON THE PROMISE IT MADE LAST SEPTEMBER (DURING CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPINGS INDIA VISIT) TO INVEST $20 BILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, INCLUDING IN INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN INDIA. A BUSINESS DELEGATION IS ALSO LIKELY TO JOIN THE OFFICIAL DELEGATION TO EXPLORE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA AND TO FORGE JOINT VENTURES IN FIELDS SUCH AS PROJECT EXPORTS. INDIAS TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA HAD HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH OF $48.5 BILLION IN FY15 (OR FOUR TIMES INDIAS EXPORTS TO CHINA IN THE FISCAL) FROM JUST $1.1 BILLION IN FY04. IN APRIL-JUNE FY16, THE TRADE DEFICIT HAS ALREADY TOUCHED $12.3 BILLION. ON THE OTHER HAND, TOTAL FDI INFLOWS FROM CHINA TO INDIA DURING APRIL 2000-JUNE 2015 WERE JUST $1.1 BILLION (OR A MINUSCULE 0.4% OF THE TOTAL $258 BILLION WORTH TOTAL FDI INFLOWS INTO INDIA DURING THE 15-YEAR PERIOD), FAR BELOW POTENTIAL. OTHER ISSUES THAT COULD COME UP FOR DISCUSSION INCLUDE COMPLAINTS FROM INDIAN EXPORTERS AGAINST SPURIOUS DRUGS MADE IN CHINA, BRANDED WRONGLY AS INDIAN AND SOLD IN OVERSEAS MARKETS TO DAMAGE THE REPUTATION OF INDIAN DRUG COMPANIES. CHINA HAD ASSURED TO INVEST AND DEVELOP TWO MEGA INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN GUJARAT AND MAHARASHTRA, BESIDES INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN INDIA. HOWEVER, DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING THE REQUIRED LAND FOR THESE INDUSTRIAL PARKS HAS BEEN THE CAUSE FOR DELAY, SOURCES SAID. THE INDUSTRIAL PARKS WERE MEANT TO MANUFACTURE ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, POWER EQUIPMENT, INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY, APPAREL, ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS AND FOOTWEAR, BESIDES OTHER VALUE-ADDED ITEMS. THEY WERE THEN TO BE EXPORTED TO CHINA AND OTHER MARKETS TO BOOST INDIAS EXPORTS AND AT THE SAME TIME REDUCE THE TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA. ALSO, DESPITE PROMISES AT THE HIGHEST POLITICAL LEVELS ON REMOVING BARRIERS TO ENABLE INDIAN COMPANIES ESPECIALLY IN SECTORS THAT MATTERS MOST TO INDIA (INCLUDING PHARMA, IT/ITES, FARM PRODUCTS, MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT, AND AUTO COMPONENTS) GET BETTER MARKET ACCESS, THERE WAS NOT MUCH RESPONSE FROM THE GROUND-LEVEL AUTHORITIES IN CHINA TO REMOVE THESE OBSTACLES, SOURCES SAID. EXPORTERS HAD SAID THE YUAN DEVALUATION WILL NOT ONLY AFFECT INDIAS IMPORTS FROM CHINA (AS THEIR REALISATION WILL BE LESSER) BUT ALSO MAKE CHINESE PRODUCTS MORE COMPETITIVE THAN COMPETING INDIAN ITEMS SUCH AS MANMADE FIBRES, GARMENTS, GEMS AND JEWELLERY, STEEL AND ORGANIC CHEMICALS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET, FURTHER HITTING INDIAS OVERALL EXPORTS.

269	THE TMO'S DITHERING CAUSED CONSTANT DELAYS AT TWICKENHAM PHOTO: REX COMMENTS THERE WAS A WILD ANIMAL ON THE PROWL LAST NIGHT AT TWICKENHAM. NOT THE BULL THAT WAS THE FIGUREHEAD OF THE OPENING CEREMONY, BUT A FAR MORE DANGEROUS BEAST A TELEVISION MATCH OFFICIAL WITH THE NEED TO JUSTIFY HIS EXISTENCE. THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH TECHNOLOGY THE SUPPOSED PANACEA FOR ALL FOOTBALLS WOES. ONCE YOU GIVE SOMEONE THE ACCESS TO A TELEVISION SCREEN AND THE POWER TO INTERVENE, JUST WATCH AND WAIT FOR THE GOD COMPLEX TO DEVELOP. SHAUN VELDSMAN, FOR IT WAS HE, WAS THE MAN WITH HIS THUMB ON THE BUTTON AND BOY DID HE ABUSE IT. ALL FLOW AND MOMENTUM WAS SUCKED FROM THE FIRST HALF WITH FOUR REFERRALS GOING UPSTAIRS, ONLY ONE WITH ANY JUSTIFICATION. THEN CAME THE DITHERING. ENGLAND FANS AWAIT THE TMO'S VERDICT BY THE LETTER OF THE LAW, CORRECT DECISIONS WERE REACHED BUT AT THE PRICE OF RUINING THE FIRST 40 MINUTES AS SPECTACLE. THE HALF-TIME WHISTLE EVENTUALLY BLEW AT 20.53. IF EVERY GAME FOLLOWS THIS PATTERN, THE FINAL MAY HAVE TO BE RESCHEDULED FOR AROUND CHRISTMAS TIME. PEOPLE PAY GOOD MONEY AND TUNE IN FROM THEIR SOFAS TO WATCH THE THRILL OF SPORT, NOT AN EPISODE OF CSI. REMEMBER, THE PURPOSE OF THE TMO IS TO BE USED ONLY WHEN THE REFEREE IS IN SERIOUS DOUBT OR HAS MISSED A SERIOUS INCIDENT. NOTE THE WORD SERIOUS. TWITTER RAGES AS THE TMO HAMPERS RUGBY WORLD CUP OPENER INSTEAD, WE WERE TREATED TO TWO EARLY EXAMPLES OF THE TMO CHECKING INCIDENTS SO TRIVIAL IN THE THAT IT IS A WONDER THAT HE DID NOT BRING ATTENTION TO A FEW SOCKS THAT HAD NOT BEEN PULLED UP. THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED WHEN AKAPUSI QERA LIFTED JONNY MAY UP BY ONE LEG. STRAIGHT AWAY, THE FIJI CAPTAIN REALISED THAT HE WAS IN DANGER OF TIPPING HIS FORMER GLOUCESTER TEAMMATE ON HIS HEAD, SO HE GENTLY LOWERED HIM TO THE FLOOR. SOUTH AFRICAN REFEREE JACO PEYPER REFERS TO THE TMO NO HARM WAS DONE AND JACO PEYPER, THE SOUTH AFRICAN REFEREE, HAD A PERFECT VIEW OF THE INCIDENT. HE SAW NOTHING WRONG IN IT. BUT THEN THE REPLAY WENT UP ON THE BIG SCREEN AND, OF COURSE, THE CROWD BAYED FOR BLOOD. LIKE A ROMAN EMPEROR AT THE COLOSSEUM, VELDSMAN FELT THAT HE HAD TO SATISFY THE BAYING MOB AND SIGNALLED THE THUMBS DOWN. THE ONLY SAVING GRACE WAS THAT HE DID NOT AWARD A YELLOW CARD. AND SO ENGLAND HAD A PENALTY. THAT WAS KICKED TO THE CORNER, ENGLANDS FORWARDS FORMED AN EXCELLENT MAUL THAT WAS ILLEGALLY BROUGHT DOWN ON THE TRY LINE WITH THE RESULT OF A PENALTY TRY. THE SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRED SOON AFTER AS API RATUNIYARAWA, THE FIJI LOCK, FLEW INTO THE RUCK WITH MINIMAL USE OF HIS ARMS. AGAIN, PEYPER HAD A VIEW OF THE INCIDENT BUT CHOSE NOT TO ACT UNTIL THE VOICE IN HIS EAR PIPED UP. A SLEW OF REPLAYS FOLLOWED, THE CROWD GROANING WITH BOREDOM ON EACH ONE. WORLD RUGBY HAVE RECENTLY URGED OFFICIALS TO CLAMPDOWN ON SUCH BEHAVIOUR, BUT IF EVERY SUCH CLEAR-OUT WAS PENALISED, THEN RUCKS WOULD CEASE TO EXIST. OF COURSE, THE WORST CASES SHOULD BE STAMPED OUT AS THEY POSE A SERIOUS RISK, BUT LETS NOT FORGET THAT PHYSICALITY IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF RUGBYS FABRIC. ARE THESE THE TYPE OF INCIDENTS THAT THE TMO WAS DESIGNED TO POLICE? HARDLY. THE TMO ROBS THE OFFICIAL ON THE GROUND OF THE CONFIDENCE TO MAKE DECISIONS THEIR MAIN PURPOSE WAS TO CHECK IF A TRY HAD BEEN SCORED, ALTHOUGH IT AGAIN TOOK THE INTERVENTION OF THE CROWD TO ALERT THE OFFICIALS TO THE FACT THAT NIKOLA MATAWALU HAD FAILED TO GROUND THE BALL AFTER HIS SENSATIONAL INDIVIDUAL SCORE. ONE REPLAY TOLD EVERYONE IN THE STADIUM THAT. INSTEAD, VELDSMAN OPTED FOR 10. EVEN IF THE RIGHT DECISION WAS ARRIVED AT, IT IS HIGHLY UNSATISFACTORY THAT REPLAYS ARE HAVING SUCH AN EFFECT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME. THE OTHER INSIDIOUS EFFECT OF THE TMO IS THAT IT ROBS THE OFFICIAL ON THE GROUND IN ALL CONFIDENCE OF MAKING DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN VOLITION. MOMENTS AFTER MATAWALUS TRY WAS DISALLOWED, BEN VOLAVOLA KICKED ACROSS FIELD TO NEMANI NADOLO WHO ROSE HIGH ABOVE ANTHONY WATSON TO CLAIM AND SCORE. THE ASSISTANT REFEREE WAS NO MORE THAN CENTIMETRES AWAY FROM THE INCIDENT BUT, NO, HIS EYESIGHT COULD NOT BE TRUSTED AND UPSTAIRS IT WENT. NEEDLESSLY. POINTLESSLY. INFURIATINGLY. IF ENGLAND ENJOYED THE BENEFIT OF THE TMOS ASSISTANCE IN THE FIRST HALF, THEY TOO FOUND OUT THE NUISANCE VALUE IN THE SECOND. TOM WOOD WAS ATTEMPTING TO CLEAR LEONE NAKARAWA OUT OF THE PATH OF A MAUL. HIS ARM WENT HIGH, TOO HIGH IN FACT, SO THAT WHEN HE THREW NAKARAWA TO THE GROUND, HE DID SO BY THE NECK. IF THE REFEREE HAD SEEN IT, HE WOULD HAVE AWARDED A PENALTY. HE DIDNT BUT IT IS HARDLY THE TYPE OF INCIDENT THAT NEEDS BRINGING TO HIS ATTENTION. RUGBY IS NOT A PERFECT GAME. PLAYERS BEND THE RULES. YOU WILL NEVER WITNESS A GAME WHERE A REFEREE GETS EVERY DECISION SPOT ON. SO ACCEPT THAT AND MOVE ON. TECHNOLOGY IS FINE IF IT ELIMINATES INJUSTICE BUT NOT IF IT RUINS SPECTACLES. TMO FLASHPOINTS 13 JONNY MAY GOES ON A RUN AND HAS HIS LEG LIFTED BY DOM WAQANIBUROTU. THE ENGLAND WING IS VERTICAL AT ONE POINT BUT AKAPUSI QERA ENSURES HIS LANDING IS A SOFT ONE. TMO AWARDS A PENALTY. 19 WAQANIBUROTU AGAIN LEADS WITH THE SHOULDER CLEARING OUT CHRIS ROBSHAW FROM THE RUCK. TMO AWARDS A PENALTY. 27 JACO PEYPER AWARDS A TRY TO NIKO MATAWALU, BUT REPLAYS SHOW THE SCRUM HALF FAILED TO GROUND THE BALL SO HE CHANGES HIS MIND. TRY DISALLOWED. 28 PEYPER AGAIN GOES UPSTAIRS WHEN NEMANI NADOLO CLAIMS A HIGH BALL ABOVE ANTHONY WATSON AND GROUNDS THE BALL DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF AN ASSISTANT REFEREE JUST CENTIMETRES AWAY. TRY AWARDED. 52 TOM WOOD GRABS LEONE NAKARAWA AROUND THE NECK IN ATTEMPTING TO CLEAR HIM FROM A MAUL. PENALTY AWARDED AGAINST ENGLAND.. 80 BILLY VUNIPOLA IS PUSHED OVER AMID A PILE OF BODIES. PEYPER IS ON THE SCENE BUT HAS NO CLEAR VIEW SO HE JUSTIFIABLY GOES UPSTAIRS. HOWEVER, A JONNY MAY KNOCK-ON IN THE BUILD UP IS MISSED. TRY AWARDED.

IT CAN CAUSE PNEUMOCONIOSIS, PLEURAL EFFUSION AND OTHER FATAL DISEASES SUCH AS LUNG CANCER, MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA, ESOPHAGEAL CANCER AND OVARIAN CANCER," SAID VICE CHAIRMAN OF VUSTA, PHAN TUNG MAU. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION (WHO) HAS LISTED ASBESTOS AMONG THE MOST DEADLY OCCUPATIONAL CARCINOGENS. IT SAYS IT CAUSES ABOUT HALF THE CANCER DEATHS IN THE WORKPLACE. THERE ARE MORE THAN 40 FACTORIES MAKING ASBESTOS ROOFING ACROSS 23 PROVINCES AND CITIES NATIONWIDE. OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN AMONG THE WORLD'S 10 LARGEST USERS OF ASBESTOS. IT CONSUMES ABOUT 65,000TONNES EVERY YEAR. HOSPITAL SURVEILLANCE 2012 SHOWED A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF ASBESTOS-RELATED DISEASES. VIET NAM HAS ALREADY TAKEN MEASURES TO REDUCE THE HARM OF ASBESTOS TO HEALTH. THE USE OF AMOSITE (BROWN ASBESTOS) AND CROCIDOLITE (BLUE ASBESTOS) WERE PROHIBITED IN 2004. HOWEVER, CHRYSOTILE (WHITE ASBESTOS) HAS YET TO BE BANNED. "ASBESTOS IS A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL THAT AFFECTS NOT ONLY WORKERS BUT ALSO CONSUMERS OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING IT," SAID TRAN TUAN, DIRECTOR OF THE RESEARCH AND TRAINING CENTRE FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT (RTCCD). "IN VIET NAM, MOST ASBESTOS ROOFING SHEETS ARE USED BY PEOPLE WITH LOW INCOMES AND IN HOUSING PROGRAMME FOR THE POOR ," TUAN SAID. "IN THE LONG TERM, THOSE PEOPLE'S HEALTH WILL BE SEVERELY IMPACTED, LEADING TO POVERTY AND ILLNESS," HE ADDED. THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO REPLACE ASBESTOS. THE MINISTRY OF CONSTRUCTION WAS INSTRUCTED TO DEVELOP A SPECIFIC ROADMAP FOR THE ELIMINATION PROCEDURE OF WHITE ASBESTOS IN ROOFING PRODUCTION IN 2020. THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH WAS ASKED TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A NATIONAL ACTION PLAN ON ERADICATING ASBESTOS-RELATED DISEASES. VNS

FACES CURBS ON ITS EXPANSION IN BRITAIN AFTER LONDON MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON'S TRANSPORT REGULATOR PROPOSED THAT DRIVERS OF PRIVATE-HIRE MINICABS SHOULD FACE EN LONDON UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC. FACES CURBS ON ITS EXPANSION IN BRITAIN AFTER LONDON MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON'S TRANSPORT REGULATOR PROPOSED THAT DRIVERS OF PRIVATE-HIRE MINICABS SHOULD FACE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE AND NAVIGATIONAL TESTS, STRICTER INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITS ON BOOKINGS. THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PART OF A CONSULTATION ON MINICAB REGULATION STARTING WEDNESDAY AND RUNNING FOR 12 WEEKS, TRANSPORT FOR LONDON SAID IN AN EMAILED STATEMENT. "NO FINAL DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AND WE'RE KEEN TO HEAR A RANGE OF VIEWS," TFL CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER GARRETT EMMERSON SAID IN THE RELEASE. UBER, WHOSE PHONE APPLICATION-BASED BOOKING SYSTEM HAS CHANGED THE FACE OF TAXI TRAVEL, SAID THE PROPOSALS INCLUDE A MANDATORY FIVE-MINUTE WAIT TIME EVEN IF A CAR IS ROUND THE CORNER, WITH THE APP NO LONGER DISPLAYING THE LOCATIONS OF THE NEAREST VEHICLES. THE U.S. COMPANY, WHICH SET UP IN LONDON THREE YEARS AGO, SENT AN EMAIL TO USERS ASKING THEM TO SIGN A PETITION AGAINST THE PLANS. "IF ADOPTED, THEY WILL MEAN AN END TO THE UBER YOU KNOW AND LOVE," IT SAID. "TFL NEEDS TO HEAR FROM YOU: RIDERS SHOULD COME FIRST." THE COMPANY SAID THE PROPOSALS ALSO ENVISAGE RESTRICTIONS ON SERVICES NOT YET AVAILABLE IN LONDON, INCLUDING THE UBERPOOL OPTION THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SHARE A VEHICLE. THE MAYOR SAID IN MAY THAT ACTION WAS NEEDED TO COMBAT "THE THREAT POSED BY THE MASSIVE INCREASE WE ARE SEEING IN THE NUMBER OF PRIVATE-HIRE VEHICLES," ADDING THAT WHILE LONDON HAD 25,000 BLACK CABS AND 8,000 BUSES, THERE WERE "ALREADY OVER 75,000 MINICABS AND RISING." UBER SAID AT THE TIME THAT IT HAD 15,000 CARS IN THE BRITISH CAPITAL. BLACK-TAXI DRIVERS, WHO HAVE TO PASS A GRUELING TEST TO GET A LICENSE, HAVE COMPLAINED THAT UBER THREATENS THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND IS LOWERING SERVICE QUALITY. UBER'S DRIVERS COUNTER THAT THEY PROVIDE A CHEAPER SERVICE, AND THAT ALL CARS ACCEPT CREDIT-CARD PAYMENT AND CAN BE ORDERED TO PEOPLE'S HOMES. SADIQ KHAN, THE LABOUR PARTY CANDIDATE TO SUCCEED JOHNSON AS MAYOR, WELCOMED THE TFL RECOMMENDATIONS, SAYING IN A STATEMENT THAT SOME CAR FIRMS "DON'T HAVE THE LEVEL OF CHECKS NEEDED TO ENSURE LONDONERS' SAFETY." THE CHANGES SHOULD ALSO CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN CAB OPERATORS AND HELP PROTECT THE CITY'S "HISTORIC TAXI TRADE," HE SAID. THE PLANS FOR TOUGHER R
272	ROB HALFORD LOOKS BACK ON PMRC: 'WE GOT ATTACKED FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER' SEPTEMBER 27, 2015 0 COMMENTS BACK IN THE MID-'80S, THE PMRC (PARENTS' MUSIC RESOURCE CENTER) PUBLISHED A LIST CALLED "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN" WHICH CONSISTED OF THE TOP FIFTEEN SONGS THEY WANTED BANNED DUE TO OBJECTIONABLE LYRICS SUGGESTING VIOLENCE, SEX, DRUGS, ALCOHOL OR THE OCCULT. THEY PETITIONED FOR LYRICS TO BE PRINTED ON THE ALBUM JACKETS AND NO ONE WAS SAFE HEAVY METAL ACTS WERE RIGHT THERE ALONGSIDE THE POP STARS. AC/DC, MADONNA, MTLEY CRE, JUDAS PRIEST, PRINCE, W.A.S.P., MERCYFUL FATE, VANITY, DEF LEPPARD, CYNDI LAUPER AND TWISTED SISTER ALL MADE "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN" LIST. IN NOVEMBER 1985, THE RIAA (RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA) AGREED TO PUT "PARENTAL ADVISORY: EXPLICIT LYRICS" LABELS ON SELECTED RELEASES AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION. ASKED WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO HAVE THE JUDAS PRIEST TRACK "EAT ME ALIVE" INCLUDED IN "THE FILTHY FIFTEEN," THE BAND'S LEAD SINGER, ROB HALFORD, TOLD CANADA'S C103 RADIO STATION: "IT WAS KIND OF TOUGH, BECAUSE WE GOT ATTACKED FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER. NONE OF US THAT ARE ON THAT LIST SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE, BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME SEE A BAND LIKE PRIEST OR MY MATE DEE [SNIDER] FROM TWISTED SISTER, WE WANNA GIVE YOU A GOOD TIME, WE WANNA HELP YOU FORGET ALL THE TROUBLES AND THE WORRIES IN THE WORLD. WE WANT YOU TO COME AND ENJOY YOURSELF, HAVE A FEW DRINKS, MEET YOUR MATES, HAVE A GREAT METAL EXPERIENCE, ROCK AND ROLL EXPERIENCE. SO, TO BE ACCUSED OF THAT WAS PRETTY LOW, BUT WE GOT THROUGH IT AND WE BATTLED ON, AND I THINK WE HAD A WIN FOR EVERYBODY IN THAT RESPECT." HALFORD ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE WAY SOCIETY HAS BECOME, IN HIS VIEW, TOO POLITICALLY CORRECT. HE SAID: "WELL, AGAIN, I COULD TALK FOREVER ON THAT SUBJECT. YOU KNOW, YEAH, I THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF GIVE EACH OTHER A BREAK AND KIND OF TAKE A LONG, DEEP BREATH AND LET IT OUT VERY SLOWLY, BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE CAN GET ATTENTION IN THESE TIMES IS TO SCREAM AS LOUD AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND TO SAY THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. SO IT'S A PITY, REALLY. IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD FROM WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AS A KID. BUT, HEY, THAT'S THE WAY HUMANITY IS EVOLVING, UNFORTUNATELY. AND IT'S NOT JUST IN THE STATES; IT'S EVERYWHERE. THERE'S THIS CRAZY CACOPHONY GOING ON. BUT LEAVE ALL THAT STUFF TO THE POLITICIANS AND TO ALL THE THE KIND OF NOISE THAT WE MAKE IN METAL IS THE BEST NOISE YOU CAN GET PLAIN AND SIMPLE." JUDAS PRIEST IS CONTINUING TO TOUR IN SUPPORT OF ITS LATEST ALBUM, "REDEEMER OF SOULS", WHICH WAS RELEASED IN JULY 2014. THE FOLLOW-UP TO 2008'S DOUBLE-DISC CONCEPT ALBUM "NOSTRADAMUS" WAS BILLED AS A RETURN TO JUDAS PRIEST'S HEAVY-METAL ROOTS. "REDEEMER OF SOULS" SOLD AROUND 32,000 COPIES IN THE UNITED STATES IN ITS FIRST WEEK OF RELEASE TO LAND AT POSITION NO. 6 ON THE BILLBOARD 200 CHART.

273	DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, LATELY IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS (LETS CALL THEM RAOUL AND CHRISTINE, FOR CONVENIENCES SAKE) THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND RECENTLY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP. IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT CLOSE TO TEN YEARS AND I CONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP.  THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES. CHRISTINE AND I HAD A FALLING OUT SOME TIME AGO AND ONLY RECENTLY RECONNECTED. DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST. ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN THOUGH RAOUL IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, I HAVE GOTTEN TO  SEE A LOT OF HIS BAD SIDE (PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, SINCE I DONT TRUST MYSELF TO NOT BE BIASED), INCLUDING HIS (SEEMING) UNWILLINGNESS TO BE AFFECTIONATE EVEN IN A RELATIONSHIP HE INITIATES. IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL IN ONE OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER, THIS WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND RAOUL HAS SINCE CHANGED. ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?). I KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME; I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THAT. BUT I JUST CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.  THE RISE IN ROOM RATES IN LAGOS CANNOT BE EXPLAINED SIMPLY BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A COMBINATION OF FACTORS THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE EXPECTED TO EXERT A DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICE. PART OF ME WONDERS IF IM BEING TOO CLINGY ABOUT THIS? ITS THEIR LIVES AND I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO GET IT IN PRACTICE.  MAYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR THEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE. IVE THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW IM NOT AS BOTHERED AS I WAS INITIALLY. UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH.  THE ACCELERATOR WILL WORK THROUGH A COMPANY ARM HAS ESTABLISHED WITH BEIJING-BASEDTHUNDERSOFT, WHICH ALREADYSPECIALIZES IN HELPING SMARTPHONE AND TABLET VENDORS REFINE THE SOFTWARE ON THEIR DEVICES.THE ACCELERATOR'S FIRST OFFICE WILL BE BASED IN BEIJING, BUT TO REACH MORE STARTUPS, FOUR OR FIVE OTHER OFFICES WILL BE SET UP ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO. I STILL CANT FULLY COME TO TERMS WITH IT AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I  WAS BETTER THAN THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY I CANT JUST LIVE AND LET LIVE? WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO? SIGNED, OVERLY ANXIOUS FOR NO GOOD REASON

275	BY LIM SUE GOAN TRANSLATED BY DOMINIC LOH SIN CHEW DAILY LAST YEAR, MALAYSIA AND CHINA CELEBRATED THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC TIES BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE CORDIAL RELATIONSHIP MIGHT NOW SUFFER A MINOR HICCUP OWING TO A DIPLOMATIC INCIDENT ARISING FROM RECENT REMARKS BY AMBASSADOR HUANG HUIKANG. WISMA PUTRA HAS WANTED HUANG TO OFFER AN EXPLANATION ON WHAT HE SAID DURING A RECENT VISIT TO PETALING STREET. ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS, THE FOREIGN MINISTRY VIEWS HUANG'S REMARKS VERY SERIOUSLY, AND IS OF THE OPINION WHAT HE SAID ABOUT TERRORISM AND INTEREST OF CHINESE NATIONALS AS HAVING INTERFERED IN MALAYSIA'S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. HAVING READ THE FULL TRANSCRIPT OF AMBASSADOR HUANG'S SPEECH, I FIND NO PARTS IN THE SPEECH THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED AS HE HAVING INTERFERED INTO THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. HUANG'S REMARKS ON TERRORISM AND INTEREST OF CHINESE NATIONALS WAS MEANT TO EXPLAIN THE STAND OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. THE FOLLOWING IS THE EXCERPT FROM HIS SPEECH: "THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRACTICING THE FIVE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES ON PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE WHEN DEALING WITH INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND WILL NEVER INTERFERE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. "HOWEVER, WE WILL NOT DISREGARD ACTS THAT MIGHT VIOLATE THE NATIONAL INTEREST OF CHINA OR THE LEGITIMATE RIGHTS OF CHINESE CITIZENS AND COMPANIES AS WELL AS ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES THAT MIGHT JEOPARDIZE THE FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA AND THE HOST COUNTRIES. "THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS STRONGLY AGAINST ALL FORMS OF TERRORISM AND ACTS OF RACISM OR EXTREMISM AGAINST SPECIFIC ETHNIC COMMUNITIES. WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO SERIOUS VIOLENCE THAT WILL IMPERIL PUBLIC ORDER AND SOCIAL HARMONY." THE AMBASSADOR DID NOT MENTION CHINESE MALAYSIANS IN HIS SPEECH, NOR DID HE TALK ABOUT THE RALLY AT PETALING STREET. HE HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW SPIRIT AND HIS OPPOSITION TO ANY FORM OF TERRORISM, RACISM AND EXTREMISM IN PROTECTING THE LEGITIMATE RIGHTS OF CHINESE CITIZENS AND COMPANIES ABROAD. AS THE AMBASSADOR HAS SAID HIMSELF, HIS VISIT TO PETALING STREET WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ACT OF GOODWILL BUT PERHAPS DUE TO THE BAD TIMING, THE INCIDENT HAS SINCE SPARKED SOME SKEPTICISM AMONG CERTAIN QUARTERS IN THIS COUNTRY. EVEN THEN, THIS IS NOT REASON ENOUGH TO SUMMON THE AMBASSADOR, A DIPLOMATIC MOVE WHICH IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY AND RASH. IN DIPLOMATIC TERMS, SUMMONING A FOREIGN ENVOY IMPLIES OBJECTION AND PROTEST. GIVEN THE CORDIAL BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MALAYSIA AND CHINA, THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OTHER BETTER WAYS OF DISPELLING ANY MISUNDERSTANDING INSTEAD OF BLATANTLY DEMONSTRATING OUR POWER AS A SOVEREIGN STATE, FOR SUCH RECKLESS ACT WILL INVARIABLY HURT THE FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF A FRIENDLY NATION. THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS YET TO BE CLARIFIED BY THE GOVERNMENT OVER THE SUMMONING OF THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR. FIRST AND FOREMOST, UPON WHICH PART OF THE AMBASSADOR'S SPEECH DID THE FOREIGN MINISTRY CONCLUDE THAT HUANG INTERFERED IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS? THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS HAVE ACCURATELY REPORTED THE SPEECH DELIVERED BY THE AMBASSADOR AT PETALING STREET, BUT UNFORTUNATELY SOCIAL MEDIA USERS AND SOME IRRESPONSIBLE POLITICIANS HAVE DISTORTED HIS SPEECH INTO ONE THAT LENDS MORAL SUPPORT TO CHINESE MALAYSIANS IN ANTAGONIZING THE MALAYSIAN AUTHORITIES. SINCE THE GOVERNMENT HAS TIME AND AGAIN ADVISED THE PUBLIC NOT TO BLINDLY BELIEVE IN NEWS CIRCULATED ON THE INTERNET, WHY DIDN'T IT SEEK VERIFICATION FIRST BEFORE JUMPING INTO SUCH A DRASTIC ACTION? MCA MINISTERS HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED THEIR SHOCK OVER WISMA PUTRA'S MOVE, AS THEY FEEL THAT THE AMBASSADOR'S SPEECH OFFERS NO HINT OF INTERFERENCE IN MALAYSIA'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. AND SINCE WE HAVE CABINET MINISTERS WELL VERSED IN THE CHINESE LANGUAGE, WHY DIDN'T THE FOREIGN MINISTRY CONSULT THEIR VIEWS IN THE FIRST PLACE? PM NAJIB AND FOREIGN MINISTER ANIFAH AMAN ARE CURRENTLY ON A WORKING VISIT IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT DID THEY KNOW THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY HAD THE INTENTION OF SUMMONING THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR? IF NOT, IS IT THE RIGHT PROTOCOL TO NOTIFY THE PM ONLY AFTER A DECISION HAS BEEN MADE? INTERESTINGLY, UMNO YOUTH EXCO MEMBER ARMAND AZHAR ABU HANIFAH ON SATURDAY ALSO ISSUED A STATEMENT HITTING OUT AT AMBASSADOR HUANG FOR INTERFERING IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. WE NEED TO STRESS A POINT THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY SHOULD ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY. PERHAPS WE SHOULD PROTEST TO INDONESIA OVER THE HAZE FROM FOREST CLEARING IN THAT COUNTRY AS THIS HAS COMPROMISED THE HEALTH OF MALAYSIANS. IS SUMMONING THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR MORE URGENT THAN THAT? ANOTHER QUESTION: DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER REEZAL MERICAN WAS SPOTTED IN THE STREET DURING THE SEPTEMBER 16 RAKYAT BERSATU RALLY. AND SINCE HE WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE RALLY, HE SHOULD NOT BE THE ONE TO HANDLE THE AMBASSADOR'S VISIT TO PETALING STREET. AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A SHARPLY DECLINING RINGGIT AND BATTERED ECONOMY, PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD FOCUS MORE OF ITS ATTENTION ON RESTORING THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY, INCLUDING IMPROVING ITS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH OTHER FRIENDLY NATIONS SUCH AS CHINA. WE HAVE VALID REASONS TO FEAR THAT EXCESSIVE POLITICKING AND RACIST EMOTIONS WILL FURTHER AGGRAVATE THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC GLOOM. WE INDEED NEED MORE FRIENDS THAN ADVERSARIES DURING SUCH A CRITICAL PERIOD OF TIME.

278	FORMER IRELAND CENTRE GORDON D'ARCY HAS DELIVERED A SCATHING ASSESSMENT OF SAM BURGESS' PERFORMANCE AGAINST WALES BY CLAIMING HIS "NAIVETY EMBARRASSED THOSE AROUND HIM". BURGESS, WHO SWITCHED CODES FROM RUGBY LEAGUE LAST OCTOBER, FORMED A SURPRISE MIDFIELD TRIO ALONGSIDE FLY-HALF OWEN FARRELL AND OUTSIDE CENTRE BARD BARRITT FOR SATURDAY'S 28-25 DEFEAT AT TWICKENHAM. ENGLAND'S MANAGEMENT VIEW THE SELECTION AS A SUCCESS, POINTING OUT THAT IT HELPED NULLIFY THE WELSH GAINLINE THREAT WITH THE HOSTS TAKING 10-POINT LEADS TWICE IN THE SECOND HALF UNTIL A LATE IMPLOSION HELPED WARREN GATLAND'S MEN SNATCH A FAMOUS WIN. D'ARCY - WHO WON 82 CAPS FOR IRELAND AS PART OF A FAMED CENTRE PARTNERSHIP WITH BRIAN O'DRISCOLL - TAKES A DIFFERENT VIEW, HOWEVER, AS ENGLAND CONTINUE TO COME UNDER ATTACK AHEAD OF THEIR DO-OR-DIE CLASH WITH AUSTRALIA ON SATURDAY. "BURGESS LACKS THE SENSE OF TIMING, IN ATTACK AND DEFENCE, REQUIRED TO BE EFFECTIVE AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL," D'ARCY WROTE IN A COLUMN FOR THE IRISH TIMES. "HIS NAIVETY EMBARRASSED THOSE AROUND HIM AND SEVERELY DAMAGED ENGLAND'S CHANCES OF REACHING THE QUARTER-FINALS. "(HEAD COACH) STUART LANCASTER PICKED A LEAGUE CONVERT WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY INSIDE CENTRE FOR THE BIGGEST MATCH ENGLAND HAVE PLAYED SINCE THE 2007 WORLD CUP FINAL. "TO COMPOUND THE PROBLEM, BRAD BARRITT WAS OUT OF POSITION AT 13 AND EXPOSED ACCORDINGLY WHEN IT MATTERED MOST. "BY PICKING OWEN FARRELL, BURGESS AND BARRITT, ENGLAND DIDN'T COME TO TWICKENHAM TO PLAY RUGBY. WE ALL KNEW THIS. "BURGESS NEVER GOT TO THE PACE AGAINST WALES. HE CLEARLY BUST A GUT BUT EFFORT AND STRENGTH WERE NEVER GOING TO BE ENOUGH. BARRITT WAS ARGUABLY WORSE AND BADLY EXPOSED FOR THE GARETH DAVIES TRY. "BY THEN THE BURGESS EXPERIMENT HAD BEEN ABANDONED BECAUSE THE ENGLAND COACHING TEAM ACCEPTED, LONG AFTER EVERYONE ELSE, THAT HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING AROUND HIM. "ALL BURGESS DID WAS RUN STRAIGHT IN SEARCH OF COLLISIONS WITH JAMIE ROBERTS (WHO OBLIGED BUT REALLY CONNED HIM MOST OF THE TIME). "SAM IS A PHENOMENAL ATHLETE AND CLEARLY A FAST LEARNER. THE DAMNING QUESTION FOR LANCASTER'S ENGLAND IS: WHY WERE THESE LEARNING CURVES TAKING PLACE IN THE POOL OF DEATH'S MUST-WIN GAME?" D'ARCY ADDS THAT LUTHER BURRELL SHOULD HAVE BEEN FILLING THE ROLE REQUESTED OF BURGESS AS HE HAS ALREADY "PROVED HE CAN DO WHAT THEY HOPED BURGESS WOULD DO".

280	AUTHOR: MICHAEL D. BARR, FLINDERS UNIVERSITY ONE OF THE LINGERING QUESTIONS OF SINGAPORE POLITICS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES HAS BEEN HOW TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS THE NATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM INTRODUCED TO SCHOOLS IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 1990S. THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO INSTIL INTO THE NEXT GENERATION A DEEP SENSE OF GRATITUDE TO FOUNDING FATHER LEE KUAN YEW AND THE PEOPLES ACTION PARTY (PAP) GOVERNMENT THAT HE LED FOR 30 YEARS. TALKING TO THE YOUNGISH PRODUCTS OF THIS SYSTEM, IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE A GOOD WORD TO SAY ABOUT NATIONAL EDUCATION. THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT ITS BANALITY AND ITS HEAVY HANDEDNESS. MANY SEEMED TO BE SO CYNICAL ABOUT THEIR GOVERNMENT THAT ONE COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR WONDERING IF NATIONAL EDUCATION HAD SIMPLY PRODUCED A GENERATION READY TO REBEL AGAINST AUTHORITY. CERTAINLY THE GOVERNMENT WAS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ELECTORAL IMPACT OF THIS GENERATION AS THEY GREW TO ADULTHOOD AND BECAME MORE SIGNIFICANT POLITICALLY. HENCE THE GOVERNMENTS CONSTANT EXPRESSIONS OF WORRY OVER THE LAST DECADE OR MORE THAT THE GENERATIONS THAT NEVER KNEW THE HARD AND INSECURE YEARS OF THE 1950S, 1960S AND 1970S DID NOT APPRECIATE WHAT HAD BEEN DONE FOR THEM AND WOULD FLIRT WITH ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS. THIS WAS WHY IT PAID SO MUCH ATTENTION TO FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN MANAGING THE INTERNET IN RECENT YEARS: ALLOWING A RELATIVELY FREE FLOW OF IDEAS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF EVENTS WHILE CRUSHING ANY BLOGGER OR NEWS SOURCE WHOSE CONTENT OR DEMEANOUR SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED THE GOVERNMENT. SINGAPORES GENERAL ELECTION ON 11 SEPTEMBER 2015 SETTLED SUCH MATTERS. THE INTERNET GENERATION MAY NOT LOVE THE PAP LIKE THEIR GRANDPARENTS DO, AND MAY DELIGHT IN JOKES AT THEIR EXPENSE, BUT THEY HAVE SWALLOWED THEIR NATIONAL EDUCATION LESSONS WHOLE. THEY CANNOT COUNTENANCE SINGAPORE WITHOUT ITS TRADITIONAL RULING CLASS WHICH IS EPITOMISED BY THE LEE FAMILY. THIS WAS THE MAJOR TAKE-AWAY MESSAGE FROM THE PAPS OVERWHELMING ELECTION VICTORY . THE RULING PARTY RECEIVED 70 PER CENT OF THE VOTE (UP FROM A RECORD LOW OF 60 PER CENT), REDUCED THE OPPOSITIONS SHARE OF ELECTED MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FROM SEVEN TO SIX AND CAME WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED VOTES OF REDUCING THE OPPOSITION TO A SINGLE SEAT WHICH IS WHERE IT STARTED WAY BACK IN 1981. THE OPPOSITION HAS, IN FACT, BEEN REDUCED TO ITS CORE SUPPORT BASE OF 30 PER CENT OF THE VOTE, DESPITE THE GOVERNMENTS PERFORMANCE OVER THE LAST DECADE BEING A LITANY OF MISSTEPS AND POLICY ERRORS. IT WAS A STUNNING OUTCOME THAT CLEARLY SURPRISED NO ONE MORE THAN THE WINNERS. IN HIS POST-ELECTION PRESS CONFERENCE, PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG THE SON OF LEE KUAN YEW MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT ABOUT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF THE VICTORY: THE SUPPORT OF THE YOUNGER VOTERS. THIS RESULT MEANS THAT THE LONGEVITY OF THE RULE OF SINGAPORES CURRENT ELITE IS ALL-BUT ASSURED IN THE MEDIUM-TO-LONG TERM. NO ONE SHOULD LOOK FOR ANY GREAT SHIFTS DUE TO GENERATIONAL CHANGE ON THE PART OF THE ELECTORATE. THE PEOPLE OF SINGAPORE INCLUDING YOUNG, EDUCATED, MIDDLE CLASS VOTERS HAVE OVERWHELMINGLY ENDORSED A FORM OF TECHNOCRATIC AUTHORITARIANISM AND TURNED THEIR BACK ON ANY PROSPECT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TWO-PARTY DEMOCRACY . FROM NOW ON, THE MAIN DANGER TO THE RULING ELITE IN SINGAPORE IS THE FRUITS OF ITS OWN SUCCESS: HUBRIS, INSULAR GROUPTHINK AND ARROGANCE. WHAT WAS SHOWN ON 11 SEPTEMBER IS THAT, EVEN WITH SUCH FACTORS IN PLAY, THEY WILL STILL SURVIVE COMFORTABLY. THIS OUTCOME IS MOST IMPORTANT TO SINGAPOREANS, BUT IT WILL ALSO BRING SOLACE AND COMFORT TO AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES MORE GENERALLY. IT WILL PARTICULARLY COMFORT THE RULING PARTY IN CHINA, WHICH MODELS ITSELF TO SOME EXTENT ON SINGAPORES TECHNOCRATIC, CAPITALIST, AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEM (BUT OF COURSE WITHOUT EVEN THE SUPERFICIAL TRAPPINGS OF DEMOCRACY). SCHOLARLY DISCUSSION OF SO-CALLED HYBRID REGIMES THAT PRESUME A DRIFT TOWARDS DEMOCRATISATION AS THE COUNTRY BECOMES BETTER EDUCATED AND MORE MIDDLE CLASS ALSO NEEDS TO TAKE NOTE: THE WELL-EDUCATED AND THE MIDDLE CLASS ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF ENDORSING AUTHORITARIANISM. INDEED THE TRADE-OFF OF DEMOCRATIC AND LIBERAL RIGHTS IN EXCHANGE FOR A SAFE AND PROSPEROUS SOCIETY SHOULD BE REGARDED AND ACCEPTED AS A RATIONAL CHOICE, AS UNPALATABLE AS THIS FORMULA MAY BE.

282	BY BEN LEVISOHN STOCKS BATTLED BACK IN A BIG WAY TODAY. EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY THE S&P 500 ROSE 2.5% TO 1,969.41, THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ADVANCED 390.30 POINTS, OR 2.4%, TO 16.492.68 AS ALL 30 STOCKS IN THE BLUE-CHIP BENCHMARK FINSIHED HIGHER, AND THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE GAINED 2.7% TO 4,811.93. PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE, ONLY 12 OF THE STOCKS IN THE S&P 500 FINISHED IN THE RED TODAY. THE FOLKS AT BESPOKE INVESTMENT GROUP MARVEL AT THE SHEER NUMBER OF SUCH ALL OR NOTHING DAYS: LONG TERM CLIENTS OF BESPOKE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH OUR TERM ALL OR NOTHING DAYS, BUT FOR THOSE THAT ARENT, AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY IS A DAY WHERE THE NET ADVANCE/DECLINE READING FOR THE S&P 500 (NUMBER OF ADVANCERS ON A DAILY BASIS MINUS NUMBER OF DECLINERS) IS ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400. SINCE THE SELL-OFF REALLY BEGAN IN EARNEST ON 8/20/15, THE S&P 500S DAILY ADVANCE/DECLINE READING HAS BEEN ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400 ON EIGHT TRADING DAYS THROUGH FRIDAY (AS OF 2PM MONDAY, THE S&P 500S A/D READING IS CURRENTLY ABOVE +400 AGAIN). TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, PRIOR TO 8/20 THERE HAD ONLY BEEN 13 TRADING DAYS IN ALL OF 2015 WHERE THE S&P 500 HAD AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY. WE LOOKED TO SEE HOW COMMON IT HAS BEEN TO SEE EIGHT ALL OR NOTHING DAYS OVER A TWELVE TRADING DAY PERIOD, AND FOUND THAT SINCE OUR DAILY BREADTH DATA BEGINS IN 1990, THESE EVENTS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY RARE. IN FACT, THE ONLY TWO PERIODS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE WAS DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN LATE NOVEMBER/EARLY DECEMBER 2008 (WHERE WE SAW FIVE STRAIGHT DAILY OCCURRENCES) AND ON ONE DAY DURING THE 2011 CORRECTION ON 10/6/11. BMOS BRIAN BELSKI ARGUES THAT S&P 500 FUNDAMENTALS WEATHERED THE STORM: DESPITE A DIFFICULT MONTH FOR STOCK PRICES, UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS REMAINED LARGELY INTACT ACCORDING TO OUR MODELS. AS A RESULT, WE VIEW THE RECENT WEAKNESS AS MORE TECHNICAL IN NATURE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT U.S. ECONOMIC DATA CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. ONE SILVER LINING OF THE RECENT PLUNGE WAS THAT S&P 500 VALUATION REGISTERED ONE OF THE LARGEST MONTHLY CONTRACTIONS OF THIS BULL MARKET. HOWEVER, VALUATION REMAINS ELEVATED FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, BUT HAS RETREATED FROM ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVELS. BY CONTRAST, EARNINGS-RELATED DATA CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OVERALL FUNDAMENTAL LEVELS AND ESPECIALLY REVISIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPROVING SHARPLY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. IN FACT, OUR FUNDAMENTAL COMPOSITE HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT AFTER BOTTOMING EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WHICH SHOULD BE A VIEWED AS A POSITIVE SIGN FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT SOMETHING MORE OMINOUS IS ON THE HORIZON FOR U.S. STOCKS. WHAT, ME WORRY?

284	NIGEL FARAGE HAS CALLED ON UKIP TO PUT COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY AND DEDICATE ITSELF TO SECURING A NO VOTE IN THE UPCOMING REFERENDUM ON BRITAINS MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE UKIP LEADER TOLD ACTIVISTS THEY HAD A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE COUNTRY BACK. MR FARAGE SAID AN EXIT FROM THE EU WAS DEARER TO MY HEART THAN UKIP, AND URGED PARTY MEMBERS TO PUT ALL OF THEIR ENERGY INTO FIGHTING THE NO CAMPAIGN AHEAD OF THE VOTE, WHICH IS DUE TO BE HELD BEFORE THE END OF 2017. HE TOLD THE PARTYS ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN DONCASTER: I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU, AS THE LEADER OF THIS PARTY, AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS GIVEN OVER 20 YEARS OF HIS LIFE TO HELPING BUILD THIS PARTY, WHILE OF COURSE I WANT US TO DO WELL AS A PARTY AND SUCCEED IN THOSE ELECTIONS THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTUALLY DEARER TO MY HEART THAN PARTY POLITICS, EVEN IF ITS UKIP. I WANT US TO SUMMON EVERY RESOURCE OF ENERGY THAT WE CAN FIND IN OUR BODIES AND OUR MINDS, I WANT US TO DEDICATE OURSELVES WHOLLY TO WINNING THAT REFERENDUM. HE ADDED: THIS IS THE MOMENT TO PUT COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY. THIS IS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK THE INDEPENDENCE AND SELF-GOVERNMENT OF THIS NATION. OUR MESSAGE IS CLEAR, WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK. ON THE SUBJECT OF MIGRATION, MR FARAGE SAID HE HAD WARNED THAT EU POLICY WOULD LEAD TO AN EXODUS OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS, BUT NO ONE LISTENED TO HIM. HE SAID THE EUS APPALLING MISHANDLING OF THE CRISIS WOULD MEAN BRITAIN WOULD NOT VOTE TO JOIN THE UNION TODAY IF IT HAD THE CHOICE. MR FARAGE ATTACKED SOFT EUROSCEPTICS WHO ARE WAITING FOR DAVID CAMERON TO FINISH RENEGOTIATING THE UKS EU MEMBERSHIP BEFORE DECIDING HOW TO CAMPAIGN. HE SAID THIS WAS A FOOLISH COURSE OF ACTION BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER IS NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL SUCH AS BORDER CONTROL, FREEDOM FROM EUROPEAN COURT RULINGS OR A REDUCTION IN THE EU MEMBERSHIP FEE. DESPITE HIGH HOPES WITHIN THE PARTY BEFORE THE RECENT GENERAL ELECTION, UKIP MANAGED TO WIN ONLY ONE SEAT. MR FARAGE HIMSELF CAME UP SHORT IN HIS BID TO BECOME AN MP, LOSING OUT INTHANETSOUTH. BUT HE SAID THE PARTY COULD BE PROUD OF WHAT IT ACHIEVED AT THE BALLOT BOX, TAKING BIG CHUNKS OUT OF THE LABOUR PARTY ON THE WAY TO GAINING ALMOST FOUR MILLION VOTES. MR FARAGE THEN TURNED HIS ATTENTIONS TO LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBYN, WHO HE EARLIER DESCRIBED IN A SKY NEWS INTERVIEW AS A GIFT FOR UKIP. HE SAID MR CORBYNSPOLICIES NOW MEAN THAT A WHOLE NEW FLANK OF THE LABOUR VOTE IN THE MIDLANDS, IN THE NORTH AND WALES AND RIGHT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IS NOW OPEN TO UKIP.
285	ON TO WET SIFTING, WHICH IS QUITE A PROCESS! I GOT PHOTOS OF MARGARETS TURN, BUT THE BOYS EACH GOT TO TRY IT TOO. STEP ONE: COLLECT DIRT. WHAT YOURE REALLY AIMING FOR IS GRAVEL, BUT YOURE GOING TO GET DIRT TOO. IDEALLY YOUD LOOK FOR PLACES WHERE GRAVEL COLLECTED WHEN WASHED ALONG BY RAIN, BUT THIS PART OF THE FIELD HAD JUST BEEN PLOWED AND IT HADNT RAINED YET, SO I DONT THINK IT MATTERED. BESIDES, AARON LET EACH OF THE KIDS CHOOSE THEIR OWN SPOT TO COLLECT FROM. NOW YOU NEST YOUR SCREENS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND DUMP YOUR BUCKET INTO THE TOP. THE TOP SCREEN HAS A WIDE MESH AND THE BOTTOM ONE IS MUCH FINER. THEN YOU SUBMERGE YOUR SCREENS AND START WASHING OUT THE DIRT. THE LARGER ROCKS WILL STAY IN THE TOP SCREEN, AND THE BOTTOM SCREEN WILL COLLECT THE FINE GRAVEL. ONCE THE LARGER ROCKS ARE RINSED, YOU SET THAT SCREEN ASIDE AND COME BACK TO IT WHEN YOURE DONE WITH THE SMALLER ONE. HERE YOU CAN SEE AARON HAS BOTH SCREENS. EZRA SAID A LOT OF PEOPLE MISS THE TWO-STEP PROCESS AND HE SEES THEM RENT A SET OF SCREENS AND JUST USE ONE PER PERSON. ONCE THE TOP SCREEN IS DONE, YOU FOCUS ON THE FINE MESH SCREEN. FIRST YOU ROCK IT BACK AND FORTH UNTIL THE GRAVEL COLLECTS IN A LINE DOWN THE MIDDLE. THEN YOU TAP THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN UNTIL IT SPREAD OUT NICE AND EVEN. TURN THE SCREEN 90 DEGREES AND REPEAT THIS PROCESS AT LEAST EIGHT TIMES. AS YOU CONTINUE TO ROCK AND TAP, THE HEAVIEST BITS OF GRAVEL MOVE DOWN AND TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN. DIAMONDS ARE HEAVY, SO THIS WAY YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THEM IN YOUR SCREEN. ONCE YOURE DONE, YOU DRAIN THE SCREEN. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THERES MUCH WATER LEFT IN THE SCREEN THE GRAVEL WONT DUMP OUT NEATLY IN THE SAME ORDER ITS IN THE SCREEN. THEN YOU FLIP THE SCREEN OVER ONTO A FLAT SURFACE. YOU HAVE TO DO IT VERY QUICKLY AND SMOOTHLY, SO THAT YOU DONT DISRUPT THE WAY THE GRAVEL HAS SETTLED INTO THE SCREEN. THEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOUVE GOT. THERE SHOULD BE A FAIRLY WELL DEFINED CENTER OF THE HEAVIEST BITS. SEE THAT CLUSTER OF WHITE STUFF? THATS AARON AND MARGARETS CENTER. UNFORTUNATELY THE WHITE STUFF IS ALL QUARTZ, NOT DIAMONDS. BUT THE FACT THAT ITS ALL TOGETHER LIKE THAT SHOWS THAT HE DID A GOOD JOB IN HIS SIFTING PROCESS. EZRA SAID IF YOU WANT TO TAKE GRAVEL HOME, YOU SHOULD SCOOP UP THAT CENTER AREA AND PUT IT IN YOUR BUCKET. IF YOU GO HOME AND BAKE IT ON A COOKIE SHEET TO DRY IT OUT, ITS EASIER TO SORT BECAUSE NOT EVERYTHING IS SHINY AND WET ANYMORE. HE SAID ABOUT HALF OF THE DIAMONDS FOUND BY WET SIFTING ARE FOUND IN GRAVEL THATS TAKEN HOME. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN ITS YOUR SISTERS TURN TO WET SIFT AND YOURE TIRED OF LOOKING FOR DIAMONDS? YOU FIND ONE OF THE FEW SHADE ISLANDS AND INVENT A GAME! NO DIGGING IS ALLOWED NEAR THE TREES BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW OF THEM ON THE FIELD, BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, THE BOYS FOUND A LARGE HOLE SOMEONE LEFT. AARON AND MARGARET FINISHED UP THEIR WET SIFTING AND CAME TO JOIN US. I DID A LITTLE MORE SURFACE SEARCHING WHILE THE KIDS GOT DADDY TO READ THEM SOME SIGNS AND THINGS POSTED AROUND THE FIELD, THEN WE CALLED IT A DAY. THIS IS WHAT YOU SEE WHEN SURFACE SEARCHING. DIAMONDS ARE OILY AND DIRT DOESNT STICK TO THEM, SO YOURE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING CLEAN AND WITH A METALLIC SHEEN TO IT. THE DIAMONDS IN THE CRATER ARE MOSTLY YELLOW, WHITE AND BROWN. IF YOUVE DONE IT RIGHT YOU PROBABLY NEED TO BE HOSED OFF A LITTLE WHEN YOURE DONE, SO THEYVE PROVIDED A HANDY WASHING STATION. NEXT UP: PETIT JEAN STATE PARK!

288	MY GOAL IN WRITING THIS ARTICLE IS TO UNRAVEL SOME OF THE CONFUSION ABOUT THESE THREE DOCUMENTS. IT IS HARD ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THESE DOCUMENTS MEAN IN MASSACHUSETTS, BUT THEN WE HAVE NEIGHBORING STATES OR POPULAR SNOWBIRD DESTINATIONS WITH A DOCUMENT CALLED DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE. GOOD HEAVENS, WHAT IS THAT? IS IT A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY OR A HEALTH CARE PROXY OR BOTH? FIRST, LETS JUST SAY THAT THE DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY IN MASSACHUSETTS IS A DOCUMENT SOLELY FOR MANAGING THE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS OF ANOTHER PERSON AND HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE PRINCIPALS HEALTH, EXCEPT PAYING FOR IT, OF COURSE. THE HEALTH CARE PROXY IS THE ONLY LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENT IN MASSACHUSETTS FOR MAKING HEALTH CARE DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON (SEE MY PREVIOUS POST ON MOLST). IT IS RELATIVELY NEW, BEING CREATED BY STATUTE IN THE 1970S, SO I STILL SEE SOME CLIENTS WHO CREATED SOME TYPE OF LIVING WILL DOCUMENT EARLY IN THEIR ADULT LIVES AND NEVER UPGRADED TO A HEALTH CARE PROXY. BEFORE THE HEALTH CARE PROXY DOCUMENT, MANY PEOPLE HAD A LIVING WILL (ALSO KNOWN AS AN ADVANCE DIRECTIVE). THE OLD LIVING WILLS WERE VERY POPULAR IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY CONSISTED OF A LIST OF SCENARIOS AND YOU WOULD CHECK A BOX FOR YES OR NO. THE SCENARIOS WERE COMPLICATED.IF YOU ARE IN A COMA AND YOU CAN NOT EAT ON YOUR OWN WOULD YOU WANT A FEEDING TUBE, YES OR NO? WELL.WHAT IS A COMA ANYWAY? MIGHT I COME OUT OF IT? CAN I SAY I WANT IT FOR TWO WEEKS AND THEN TAKE IT OUT IF I DONT RECOVER? A SIMPLE YES OR NO DID NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO EXPRESS THEIR END OF LIFE ISSUES. THE HEALTH CARE PROXY DOCUMENT DOES ONLY ONE THING: NAME A HEALTH CARE AGENT WHO CAN MAKE DECISIONS FOR YOU AT SUCH TIME AS YOU CAN NOT MAKE OR COMMUNICATE YOUR OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. THE IDEA BEHIND THE HEALTH CARE PROXY IS THAT THE HEALTH CARE AGENT KNOWS THE WISHES OF THE PRINCIPAL (MEANING, THE PERSON WHO HAS SIGNED THE HEALTH CARE PROXY DOCUMENT NAMING THE AGENT) AND CAN MAKE KNOWLEDGEABLE DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PRINCIPAL. WITH A HEALTH CARE PROXY, A DOCTOR DOES NOT NEED TO STUDY A DOCUMENT TO TRY AND DETERMINE WHICH ONE OF THE LITTLE BOXES ON THE FORM APPLIES IN THE CURRENT SITUATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PATIENT MAY HAVE CHECKED THE BOX FOR NO VENTILATOR OR INTUBATION. BUT THE DOCTOR FEELS AS IF A FEW DAYS ON A VENTILATOR WILL GIVE THE MEDICATION A CHANCE TO WORK AND THE PATIENT MAY VERY WELL RECOVER. WOULDNT THE PATIENT WANT TO TAKE THAT CHANCE? BUT UNFORTUNATELY, A CHECKMARK IN A LITTLE BOX CAN NOT CONVEY THOSE TYPES OF NUANCED DECISIONS. A PERSON, HOWEVER, CAN MAKE THOSE TYPES OF DECISIONS. A HEALTH CARE AGENT CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE DOCTOR AND MAKE A DECISION BASED ON THE FACTS AT HAND. A PERSON CAN LOOK AT ALL THE FACTS AND DECIDE THAT THE PATIENT PROBABLY WOULD WANT TO TRY THE VENTILATOR FOR A WEEK TO SEE IF HIS OR HER CONDITION IMPROVES, OR THAT THE PATIENT WOULD NOT WANT TO TRY THE VENTILATOR AND SHOULD BE TREATED WITH COMFORT CARE ONLY. SO HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM A LIVING WILL? THE LIVING WILL/ADVANCE DIRECTIVE IS NOT A LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENT IN MASSACHUSETTS. IT SERVES AS VALUABLE GUIDANCE FOR THE HEALTH CARE AGENT WHEN THE AGENT IS MAKING A DECISION. THERE ARE MANY GOOD LIVING WILL DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE SUCH AS THE FIVE WISHES AND WWW.HONORINGCHOICESMASS.COM . A REALLY GOOD LIVING WILL PROVIDES VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENTS WISHES AND CAN REALLY HELP THE HEALTH CARE PROXY MAKE DECISIONS. A DOCTOR IS UNLIKELY TO WANT TO EVEN LOOK AT A LIVING WILL UNLESS THE DOCTOR IS HELPING THE AGENT MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION. THIS IS BECAUSE A DOCTOR IS REQUIRED TO TAKE THE ACTION (OR INACTION) DIRECTED BY THE HEALTH CARE AGENT REGARDLESS OF THE WISHES EXPRESSED IN THE LIVING WILL . WHEN I AM GIVING SPEECHES, I OFTEN ASK THE AUDIENCE IF ANYONE SAW THE MOVIE THE DESCENDANTS WITH GEORGE CLOONEY. ITS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE, BY THE WAY. IT TAKES PLACE IN HAWAII AND GEORGE CLOONEYS WIFE IS IN A COMA AFTER AN ACCIDENT. AFTER A WEEK OR SO, THE DOCTOR COMES TO GEORGE AND SAYS HE IS REQUIRED TO TAKE THE WIFE OFF LIFE SUPPORT BECAUSE THE WIFE HAD A LIVING WILL. GEORGE, HOWEVER, IS NOT READY TO LET HER GO. THE DOCTOR EXPLAINS HE HAS NO CHOICE. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE LAW IN HAWAII, BUT IF THE MOVIE IS ACCURATE, HAWAII SEEMS TO HAVE A VALID AND BINDING LIVING WILL LAW WHICH REQUIRES A DOCTOR TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF THE WISHES OF THE FAMILY. IF GEORGE CLOONEY BEEN A MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENT, HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THE DECISION CONCERNING HIS WIFE RATHER THAN THE HOSPITAL MAKING THE DECISION. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT EVERY MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENT SHOULD HAVE A HEALTH CARE PROXY. IF YOU ARE A PART TIME RESIDENT OF FLORIDA AND YOU HAVE A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE BE AWARE THAT THE DOCUMENT WILL BE VERY CONFUSING TO MASSACHUSETTS PHYSICIANS. TRY TO OBTAIN AN APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE PROXY DOCUMENT FOR EVERY STATE IN WHICH YOU LIVE FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME DURING THE YEAR AND IN WHICH YOU RECEIVE HEALTHCARE.

289	BY: MS KIMAAYA MEDITATION IS THE BASIS FOR ALL INNER WORK. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT ONE CAN DISCOVER IS A DANCE MEDITATION. DANCE MOVEMENT PROVIDES THE CONDITIONS FOR LEARNING, GROWTH AND HEALING THROUGH COMPASSIONATE, EMBODIED AWARENESS WITHIN A THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP. THERE'S A DANCER IN EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US. FREEING OURSELVES TO REFOCUS INWARDLY AND IN COMMUNITY ALLOWS US TO SEE WHO WE ARE, AND SO THIS WILL BE A COMPLEX BUT AT THE SAME TIME A SIMPLIFIED PROCESS OF SELF-DISCOVERY. AS WE CONNECT TO THE DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF OUR EMBODIED BEING, WE AWAKEN OUR SOMATIC INTELLIGENCE AND BEGIN TO KNOW OUR TRUE NATURE. DANCE REFLECTS AN INDIVIDUALS PATTERNS OF THINKING, FEELING AND COMMUNICATING. DANCING IS A MEANS OF SELF-DISCOVERY. IT IS A FORM OF ART WHERE THE BODY IS THE INSTRUMENT. DANCING IS A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF LIBERATING YOUR BODY, MIND AND SOUL, FROM YOUR CONSCIOUS AWARENESS TO DEEP DOWN WITHIN YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND. DANCE OFFERS NOT JUST AS A CREATIVE OUTLET OF EXPRESSION, BUT ALSO TO RELEASE PENT-UP EMOTIONS. TRUST YOUR BODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S DOING AS YOU BREATHE, LISTEN AND RECEIVE ALLOW YOUR BODY TO BE AN EXTENSION OF YOU. TRANSFORMATION TAKES PLACE WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL IS READY TO MAKE CHANGES IN HIS/HER LIFE AND LOOK WITHIN TO FIND TRUTH, AND AUTHENTICITY. THIS UNIQUE MOVING MEDITATION IS DESIGNED TO ASSIST YOU IN ACCESSING YOUR CONSCIOUS, SUBCONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS MINDS TO RELEASE ANY PHYSICAL, MENTAL, EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL BLOCKS FOR HEALING THROUGH THE INTUITIVE MOVEMENT AND NATURAL FLOW OF YOUR BODY. DANCE MEDITATION IS ABOUT GETTING IN TOUCH WITH OUR EMOTIONS, AND OUR SPIRITUAL ESSENCE, AND EXPRESSING THAT ENERGY THROUGH OUR PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS. TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OURSELVES, WE CAN DANCE WITH A VARIETY OF MUSICAL STYLES, INCLUDING JAZZ, ROCK, CLASSICAL, AND INTERNATIONAL MUSIC REGULAR PRACTICE OF DANCE MEDITATION CAN HELP PHASE OUT TENSION AND ANXIETY FROM YOUR LIFE. THIS ALLOWS YOUR MIND TO EXPAND AND YOUR SPIRIT TO SOAR, THUS HELPING YOU UNLEASH FEELINGS OF POSITIVITY AND JOY IN YOU. JAZZ IS ESSENTIALLY THE FATHER OF ALL DANCE STYLES. THE MOVEMENTS THAT CHARACTERIZE THIS FORM ARE VERY ISOLATED, STACCATO AND LINEAR. HIP-HOP EMPHASIZES RHYTHM WITH A STRONG BEAT AND THE POETRY OF MOVEMENT. STEPS MOSTLY MOVE IN A VERTICAL DIRECTION. THIS FORM SHOULD BE VERY STYLIZED AND ENIGMATIC. A ZUMBA FITNESS PROGRAM FUSES HYPNOTIC LATIN RHYTHMS AND EASY-TO-FOLLOW MOVES TO CREATE A FUN WORKOUT THAT IS MORE LIKE ATTENDING A PARTY THAN A DANCE OR EXERCISE CLASS. THE CONCEPT OF DANCING IS SOMETHING STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH GODS. FOR EXAMPLE, LORD KRISHNA AND HIS BELOVED DANCE THE DANCE OF LOVE IN THEIR SACRED VRINDAVAN GARDENS. LORD SHIVA, OFTEN PERSONIFIED AS THE DANCING LORD NATARAJA, IS CAPABLE OF DANCING A FURIOUS DANCE THAT BRINGS ABOUT MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DESTRUCTION. PERFORMERS OF INDIAN CLASSICAL DANCES OFTEN CONSIDER THEIR ART AS A FORM OF WORSHIP. AS A MATTER OF FACT MANY OF THE INDIAN CLASSICAL DANCE FORMS HAVE DEVELOPED AND FLOURISHED AS A RESULT OF SUCH TRADITIONS OF LEARNING, TEACHING AND PERFORMING DANCES IN TEMPLES. DANCE IS NOT ONLY LANGUAGE; IT IS ALSO "LISTENING." LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF THE WAVES WITHIN YOU. NOT ONLY THE MIND IS FREE OF OUTSIDE WORLD, BUT YOU ALSO GET A GOOD SLEEP. AFTER THE SOUND, MUSIC, AND MOVEMENT STOP, THEN ENTER INTO SILENCE. IN THIS SILENCE ONE CAN ABSORB THE QUALITIES EVOKED DURING THE DANCE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE DANCE. ==================================================================== (THE WRITER, MS KIMAAYA, IS A CERTIFIED TRAINER FOR ZUMBA AND KNOWS MORE THAN 20 STYLES OF DANCING.

290	(PARIS) THE SUDAN REVOLUTIONARY FRONT (SRF), A COALITION OF REBEL GROUPS, ON WEDNESDAY CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THE DECISION OF THE AFRICAN UNION PEACE AND SECURITY COUNCIL (AUPSC) IN FAVOUR OF A PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING. THE ARMED OPPOSITION GROUPS MADE THEIR DECISION IN THEIR SECOND MEETING WITH INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ENVOYS HELD IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL PARIS TO DISCUSS POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND DRAW A MAP FOR A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE IN SUDAN. THE MEETING TAKES PLACE AFTER A DECISION BY THE AUPSC ON 25 AUGUST REITERATING ITS SUPPORT FOR A PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING GATHERING ALL THE ARMED GROUPS AND POLITICAL PARTIES BUT THE RULING NATIONAL CONGRESS PARTY (NCP) REJECTS THIS ROADMAP. SRF EXTERNAL RELATIONS SECRETARY, YASIR ARMAN,, WHO IS ALSO THE SPLM-N SECRETARY-GENERAL, TOLD SUDAN TRIBUNE THAT THE SRF URGED THE INTERNATIONAL ENVOYS TO BACK-THE RECENT DECISION OF THE AFRICAN UNION 539 IN SUPPORT OF A COMPRESSIVE AND INCLUSIVE NATIONAL DIALOGUE PROCESS IN SUDAN. ARMAN FURTHER REVEALED THAT THE ENVOYS HAVE AGREED TO BACK UP THE AUPSCS DECISION ON NATIONAL DIALOGUE. HE ASSERTED THAT THE DECISION WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL WHICH WILL SUPPORT IT, PARTICULARLY SINCE THERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT ANY MATTER THAT WINS REGIONAL CONSENSUS SHOULD RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS AS WELL. THE SECOND MEETING WAS ATTENDED BY US ENVOY TO SUDAN AND SOUTH SUDAN DONALD BOOTH, BRITISH COUNTERPART, MATTHEW CANNELL IN ADDITION TO THE HEAD OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AT THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTRY JEAN-CHRISTOPHE BELLIARD. ALSO, PRESENT WERE A REPRESENTATIVE OF NORWAY AND THE EU ENVOY FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA ALEXANDER RONDOS. DURING THE MEETING, THE SRF GROUPS STRESSED THEIR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THE UNITY OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, WHICH BESIDES THE REBEL ALLIANCE, INCLUDE THE NATIONAL UMMA PARTY (NUP), NATIONAL CONSENSUS FORCES (NCF) AND CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS. ARMAN APPEALED TO RUSSIA AND CHINA TO SUPPORT THE AFRICAN ROADMAP BECAUSE IT SETS THE FOUNDATION FOR PEACE, SECURITY AND DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH WILL ENABLE SUDAN TO ENTER INTO A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, INCLUDING RUSSIA AND CHINA. NO DEVELOPMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED AT TIMES OF WAR, HE SAID. THE MEETING WAS ADDRESSED VIA CONFERENCE CALL BY NUP LEADER AL-SADIG AL-MAHDI, NCF CHAIRMAN, FAROUK ABU ISSA, AMIN MAKKI MADANI, HEAD OF THE ALLIANCE OF THE SUDANESE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS AND GAHZI SALAH AL-DIN ATTABANI THE LEADER OF THE REFORM NOW MOVEMENT (RNM), A SPLINTER FACTION OF THE RULING PARTY. ARMAN SAID THE PARTICIPATION OF ATTABANI IN THE MEETING MARKS A PROGRESS IN THE RELATION BETWEEN THE RNM AND THE SRF. HE POINTED OUT THAT THE SRF GROUPS WILL HOLD A THREE-DAY MEETING IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL TO DISCUSS THE POLITICAL SITUATION, ADDING THE MEETING SHOULD COME OUT WITH A ROAD MAP FOR ALL ISSUES OF PEACE AND NATIONAL DIALOGUE IN SUDAN. HE SAID PREPARATIONS WERE UNDERWAY FOR A MEETING OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, BUT HE DID NOT GIVE A SPECIFIC DATE FOR THAT MEETING. ALSO, ARMAN REITERATED THAT SRF ARE COMMITTED TO THE UNITY OF THE OPPOSITION AND TO A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE SETTLEMENT, AWAY FROM PARTIAL SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE PROMISED THE SUDANESE PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE ROADMAP TO END WAR. THE BALL IS NOW IN KHARTOUMS COURT. IT IS THE PARTY THAT HAD INITIATED THESE WARS AND IT PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO BRING THEM TO AN END, HE ADDED. LAST SUNDAY, THE DIALOGUE MECHANISM SOFTENED THIS POSITION ON THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING AND ANNOUNCED ACCEPTING TO MEET THE REBEL GROUPS BEFORE THE PROCESS TO DISCUSS THE GUARANTEES ENABLING THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DIALOGUE CONFERENCE IN KHARTOUM. IN PREVIOUS STATEMENTS, THE SPLM-N SECRETARY GENERAL HAD DISMISSED GOVERNMENT PRESS REPORTS THAT KHARTOUM WOULD NOT MIND ATTENDING A PRELIMINARY MEETING WITH SRF AND ARMED GROUPS AS AN ATTEMPT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO CAUSE A RIFT IN THE OPPOSITION FORCES, PARTICULARLY BETWEEN THE SRF AND THE NUP OF SADIQ AL-MAHDI. THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING S SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD IMPLEMENT BEFORE THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO CREATE A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT. THESE INCLUDE A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND HUMANITARIAN ACCESS FOR CIVILIANS IN THE REBEL HELD AREAS, POLITICAL FREEDOMS AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. US PROPOSAL FOR STOPPING HOSTILITIES US ENVOY DONALD BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT TO THE MEDIA, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED THAT THE REBELS SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT OMER AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. FOLLOWING THE JOINT MEETING, BOOTH MET WITH REBEL GROUPS FROM DARFUR REGION AND DISCUSSED THEIR DEMAND FOR RENEGOTIATING THE DOHA DOCUMENT FOR PEACE IN DARFUR. BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED TO THE REBEL GROUPS THAT THEY SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. SUDAN TRIBUNE LEARNT THAT BOOTH ALSO HELD A SEPARATE MEETING WITH THE SPLM-N TO DISCUSS NEGOTIATIONS WITH KHARTOUM ON A DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES DOCUMENT, INCLUDING A CEASEFIRE, AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO CIVILIANS IN THE SPLM-N CONTROLLED AREAS. ON ITS PART, SUDAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT - ABDEL WAHID AL-NUR ISSUED A STATEMENT REITERATING ITS DEMAND FOR PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS, DISARMING THE JANJAWEED AND THE REMOVAL OF NEW-COMERS FROM THE LANDS AND HAWAKEER. THE STATEMENT CLEARLY PROVIDED THAT THE GROUP WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE WITH KHARTOUM UNTIL THOSE "CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES" WERE MET.

292	REVISE MARTINE HAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORDER IN PLACE, BUT SAYS HER EX-PARTNER HAS CHANGED HIS METHODS OF HARASSMENT TO AVOID GETTING CAUGHT. "MY TYRES HAVE BEEN LET DOWN, HIS CAR CONSTANTLY DRIVES PAST MY HOME, AND I KEEP GETTING PRIVATE NUMBERS CALLING MY PHONE. JUST THIS MORNING I HAD A CALL AND I KNOW IT'S HIM," SHE SAYS. "I HAVE HAD TO CHANGE MY PHONE NUMBER SIX TIMES." HAVING ALREADY BEEN THROUGH A PRE-TERM BIRTH AND LIVING WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS, MARTINE'S PREGNANCY IS CLASSIFIED AS BEING HIGH-RISK. HOWEVER, AT SIX MONTHS PREGNANT SHE HAS TO DEFEND HERSELF IN COURT FROM HER EX-PARTNER, WHO HAS MADE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT HER FITNESS TO PARENT THEIR CHILD. "I'M SCARED THE STRESS OF ALL THE COURT CASES COULD TRIGGER ANOTHER PRE-TERM LABOUR," SHE SAID. "HE SAID 'I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL YOU DIE SO I CAN PISS ON YOUR GRAVE'. I KNOW HE WANTS ME OUT OF THE PICTURE ANY WAY POSSIBLE." "HE HAS MADE MY LIFE HELL, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY."

SARAH IS PERMANENTLY DISABLED FROM HER ABUSIVE EX-PARTNER AND, LIKE MANY WOMEN, THE VIOLENCE WAS EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY. "IT JUST DIDN'T STOP. HE PUSHED SO HARD ONE TIME THAT WHEN I HIT THE FLOOR I TORE DISCS IN MY SPINE. I HAD TO HAVE DISC REPLACEMENT AND A SPINAL FUSION. I HAD TO LEARN TO WALK AGAIN," SHE SAYS, HER VOICE BREAKING AS SHE DESCRIBES HER DAILY STRUGGLE. "I WAKE EVERY DAY IN PAIN. I WILL NEVER RUN COMFORTABLY. AND WHEN MY KIDS WANT ME TO PLAY, I CAN'T. I'M IN TOO MUCH PAIN." SARAH SAYS SHE IS HARASSED DAILY AND ADMITS SHE FEARS FOR HER LIFE; SHE SAYS THE POLICE HAVE IGNORED HER CONCERNS. "HE [EX-PARTNER] HAS TOLD ME HE WANTS TO KILL HIS EX-WIFE. HE HAS TOLD ME THE WAYS HE WANTS TO DO IT. BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE POLICE THEY SAID IT'S NORMAL FOR PEOPLE TO SAY THEY WANT TO KILL THEIR EX-PARTNERS, AND IT IS A COMMON FIGURE OF SPEECH." NEARLY A QUARTER OF AUSTRALIAN WOMEN SAY THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME FORM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHILST THEY WERE PREGNANT AND HALF OF THEM EXPERIENCED ABUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING THAT PERIOD. JULIE-ANN, 28, IS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING PREGNANCY. "THE ABUSE BEGAN NINE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS 92 WEEKS PREGNANT," JULIE-ANN SAYS, SPEAKING OUT ABOUT HER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. "THINGS WERE FINE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP UNTIL THE 12 WEEK MARK AND THEN, I DON'T KNOW, IT JUST WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE." STATISTICS SHOW LEAVING AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AND PREGNANCY ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS TIMES FOR A WOMAN EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. JULIE-ANN EXPERIENCED ABUSE FOR NINE AND A HALF YEARS FOLLOWING THE FIRST PREGNANCY THROUGH FEAR OF LEAVING. EVENTUALLY SHE ESCAPED AND MOVED INTERSTATE. "IT FELT SAFER TO STAY," SHE SAYS ABOUT HER NINE YEARS OF ABUSE. "BECAUSE HE WOULD LOSE CONTROL. IF I WAS AWAY I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS, WHAT HE WAS THINKING, OR WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO." FAMILY VIOLENCE ACADEMIC DEBORAH WALSH HAS SPECIFICALLY STUDIED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREGNANCY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SAYS PREGNANCY OFTEN OFFERS HOPE THAT AN ABUSIVE PARTNER WILL CHANGE.  MS WALSH SAID DUE TO THIS HOPE WOMEN HAVE WHILE PREGNANT MANY PROCESSES INVOLVED IN SCREENING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WOULD NOT BE TOTALLY EFFECTIVE. "WE NEED TO SUPPORT MEN IN OUR COMMUNITY TO MANAGE THEIR FEELINGS APPROPRIATELY, SAFELY, AND NON-VIOLENTLY, IN A WAY THAT IT IS NOT SEEN AS AN ATTACK ON MASCULINITY, BUT INSTEAD A PART OF MASCULINITY," MS WALSH SAID. "UNLESS WE SUPPORT OUR MEN (TO) DEAL WITH THEIR EMOTIONS, FEELINGS AND ASSOCIATED BEHAVIOURS, THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE." DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION CENTRE DIRECTOR AMY COMPTON-KEEN SAID PREGNANCY AND POST-BIRTH WERE BOTH VULNERABLE TIMES FOR WOMEN AND IT WAS COMMON FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO OCCUR AT THESE TIMES. "MANY PREGNANT WOMEN DO NOT REPORT, DISCLOSE, OR SEEK HELP DUE TO FEELING VULNERABLE AND UNCERTAIN OF THE FUTURE," MS COMPTON-KEEN SAID. "THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE MAY INCLUDE PERIODS WHERE THEIR PARTNER IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE, THEIR CHILD, AND BECOMING A PARENT, AND THEY MAY MAKE PROMISES. "THESE PROMISES ARE POWERFUL AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A WOMAN REMAINING IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP." PEOPLE WHO MAY BE DISTRESSED CAN PHONE LIFELINE ON 131 114. PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THREATENING THEMSELVES OR FAMILY CAN PHONE DV CONNECT ON 1800 811 811. *PSEUDONYMS USED TO PROTECT IDENTITY. FOR INDEPENDENT NEWS COVERAGE, BE SURE TO FOLLOW OUR THE RISK OF ENDURING ANOTHER PREMATURE BIRTH IS VERY REAL FOR MARTINE*, WHO IS SIX MONTHS PREGNANT WITH HER SECOND CHILD. HER FIRST WAS BORN SEVEN WEEKS TOO EARLY AFTER A BEATING FROM HER EX-PARTNER FORCED HER INTO A HOSPITAL BED AND CONSEQUENTLY LABOUR. SIX YEARS LATER MARTINE, 29, HAS A NEW RELATIONSHIP AND A NEW BABY ON THE WAY BUT THE ABUSE HAS NOT STOPPED FROM HER EX-PARTNER, WHO CONTINUES TO HARASS HER DAILY. MARTINE IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY WOMEN IN AUSTRALIA WHOSE PREGNANCY HAS TRIGGERED YEARS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST THEM AND THEIR CHILD. DESPITE LEAVING THE MAN WHO BEAT HER INTO EARLY LABOUR, MARTINE FEARS HIS CONSTANT HARASSMENT COULD FORCE ANOTHER PREMATURE BIRTH. "HE HAS THREATENED MY LIFE, KILLED ANIMALS IN MY YARD, THREATENS ANY NEW RELATIONSHIP I START TO THE POINT WHERE PARTNERS HAVE LEFT ME," SHE SAYS.
293	ALL TIMES EASTERN SEPT. 5: AUBURN VS. LOUISVILLE IN ATLANTA (3:30 P.M., CBS) - IT'S SEC VS. ACC IN ONE OF THOSE FIRST-WEEK-NEUTRAL-SITE-KICKOFF GAMES AT THE GEORGIA DOME. AUBURN IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO ATLANTA TO TURN THE NEUTRAL SITE INTO A HOME GAME. AND THE SEC TOOK A BEATING IN HEAD-TO-HEADS WITH THE ACC LAST SEASON. GEORGIA LOST TO GEORGIA TECH. SOUTH CAROLINA LOST TO CLEMSON. KENTUCKY LOST TO LOUISVILLE. WITH NATIONAL TITLE HOPES, AUBURN WILL WANT TO START THE SEASON ON THE RIGHT FOOT. SEPT. 7: OHIO STATE AT VIRGINIA TECH (8 P.M., ESPN) - REMEMBER A YEAR AGO WHEN THE HOKIES INVADED COLUMBUS AND UPSET THE BUCKEYES? SEEMS LIKE A MIRAGE NOW. OHIO STATE RESPONDED WITH 13 STRAIGHT VICTORIES, INCLUDING THREE STRAIGHT POSTSEASON WINS TO TAKE THE NATIONAL TITLE. THE RETURN MATCHUP IS IN BLACKSBURG AND IT IS DOUBTFUL FRANK BEAMER CAN PULL THE UPSET TWO YEARS IN A ROW. BUT IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO WATCH HIM TRY. SEPT. 12: OREGON AT MICHIGAN STATE (NOON, ABC) - THE TWO TEAMS PLAYED LAST YEAR IN EUGENE, WHERE MICHIGAN STATE LED 24-18 AT THE HALF ONLY TO HIT A SECOND-HALF WALL. AFTER AN MSU FIELD GOAL EXTENDED THE LEAD TO 27-18 IN THE THIRD QUARTER, OREGON SCORED 28 UNANSWERED POINTS TO WIN 46-27. THIS YEAR, THE GAME IS IN EAST LANSING AND MICHIGAN STATE LOOKS TO BE THE BETTER, MORE EXPERIENCED TEAM BEHIND QUARTERBACK CONNOR COOK. OR IS OREGON'S SPEED JUST TOO MUCH FOR EVERY BIG TEN TEAM BUT OHIO STATE? SEPT. 19: GEORGIA TECH AT NOTRE DAME (3:30 P.M., NBC) - GEORGIA TECH CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE NATION'S MORE UNDERRATED TEAMS. THE YELLOWJACKETS HAVE BEEN TO TWO OF THE LAST THREE ACC TITLE GAMES. PAUL JOHNSON KNOWS HOW TO COACH. TECH'S OPTION OFFENSE REQUIRES EXTRA PREPARATION AND THE TEAM FROM ATLANTA WILL BE JACKED UP TO PLAY IN SOUTH BEND. MEANWHILE, IF NOTRE DAME HAS COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF ASPIRATIONS, THE IRISH MUST WIN THIS GAME. SEPT. 26: UCLA AT ARIZONA (TBA) - RICH RODRIGUEZ HAS REVITALIZED THE ARIZONA PROGRAM. JIM MORA JR. HAS REVITALIZED THE UCLA PROGRAM. WITH OREGON LOSING QUARTERBACK MARCUS MARIOTA, THE DOOR MAY BE OPEN TO A DIFFERENT PAC-12 CHAMPION. IF SO, THIS GAME IN TUCSON COULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARD IDENTIFYING THE NEW TEAM TO BEAT. OCT. 3: ALABAMA AT GEORGIA (TBA) - ALABAMA DOESN'T COME TO ATHENS ALL THAT OFTEN, BUT, AS USUAL, BOTH PROGRAMS HAVE BOTH CONFERENCE AND NATIONAL TITLE ASPIRATIONS. GEORGIA'S NICK CHUBB MAY BE THE BEST RUNNING BACK IN THE COUNTRY BUT ALABAMA'S DERRICK HENRY ISN'T BAD EITHER. AND BY THIS TIME, SURELY, ALABAMA'S NICK SABAN AND GEORGIA'S MARK RICHT WILL HAVE DECIDED ON A QUARTERBACK. SURELY. OCT. 10: GEORGIA AT TENNESSEE (TBA) - YES, WE'RE GOING WITH BACK-TO-BACK GEORGIA GAMES BECAUSE GEORGIA HAS BACK-TO-BACK BIG GAMES. TENNESSEE BELIEVES IT IS BACK, BABY, AND THIS GAME COULD PROVE IT. BUTCH JONES' CLUB GOT TO SEVEN WINS LAST SEASON AND IS AIMING HIGHER IN 2015. A WIN OVER THE BULLDOGS MIGHT EVEN PUT THE VOLS' IN THE SEC EAST DRIVER'S SEAT. OCT. 17: USC AT NOTRE DAME (7:30 P.M., NBC) - THE LUSTER MIGHT BE RETURNING TO THIS AGE-OLD RIVALRY. USC HAS WHAT NOTRE DAME HOPES TO DEVELOP - A TOP-SHELF QUARTERBACK. CODY KESSLER SET A USC RECORD BY COMPLETING 69.7 PERCENT OF HIS PASSES LAST YEAR. NOTRE DAME'S DEFENSE WILL PRESENT A CHALLENGE. IT USUALLY DOES. OCT. 24: AUBURN AT ARKANSAS (TBA) - THIRD-YEAR COACH BRET BIELEMA HAS GIVEN ARKANSAS FOOTBALL BACK ITS EDGE, THIS TIME IN THE FORM OF A POWER RUNNING GAME. THE RAZORBACKS LOST RUNNING BACK JONATHAN WILLIAMS TO A FOOT INJURY, BUT FELLOW THOUSAND-YARD RUSHER ALEX COLLINS SHOULD BE A HANDFUL FOR AUBURN'S NEW DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WILL MUSCHAMP. TO WIN THE SEC WEST, AUBURN NEEDS TO WIN THIS ONE. OCT. 29: OREGON AT ARIZONA STATE (10:30 P.M., ESPN) - TODD GRANTHAM TOOK SOME HEAT WHEN HE EXITED PITTSBURGH AFTER JUST ONE YEAR TO TAKE RESIDENCE IN TEMPE. GRANTHAM CAN COACH, HOWEVER. THE SUN DEVILS ARE COMING OFF BACK-TO-BACK 10-WIN SEASONS AND A WIN OVER OREGON IN YEAR THREE OF THE GRANTHAM ERA WOULD SEND A NATIONAL SIGNAL. NOV. 7: FLORIDA STATE AT CLEMSON (TBA) - QUARTERBACK JAMEIS WINSTON IS GONE. BUT SEMINOLES HEAD COACH JIMBO FISHER STILL HAS PLENTY OF NFL-READY TALENT BUT THE VISITORS WILL HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL TRYING TO CONTAIN CLEMSON QUARTERBACK DESHAUN WATSON. THIS GAME COULD DETERMINE WHICH TEAM IS IN THE ACC TITLE GAME. NOV. 14: OKLAHOMA AT BAYLOR (TBA) - BOB STOOPS IS IN NEED OF A BOUNCE-BACK YEAR AFTER THE SOONERS' 2014 SLIDE TO 8-5. ONE WAY TO GET THE TRAIN BACK ON THE TRACK IS TO BEAT BAYLOR IN WACO. THAT WON'T BE EASY. ART BRILES' OFFENSIVE JUGGERNAUT SURVIVED THE LOSS OF HEISMAN QUARTERBACK ROBERT GRIFFIN III, SO THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THE BEARS WON'T SURVIVE THE LOSS OF GRIFFIN'S STELLAR SUCCESSOR, BRYCE PETTY. NOV. 21: MICHIGAN STATE AT OHIO STATE (TBA) - NEVER MIND THE BIG TEN CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, THIS IS THE ONE THAT WILL DECIDE THE CONFERENCE CHAMPION. MICHIGAN STATE WON THE LEAGUE IN 2013. OHIO STATE WON IT LAST YEAR. THE BUCKEYES WILL HAVE THE HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE, BUT DON'T COUNT OUT THE SPARTANS. NOV. 27: BAYLOR AT TCU (7:30 P.M., ESPN) - THIS WILL BE A REAL DAY-AFTER-THANKSGIVING TREAT IN WACO. BAYLOR OFFICIALS INSIST IT WAS A FLUKE THAT PLAYERS WEARING THE NUMBERS 61 AND 58 WERE SIDE-BY-SIDE IN THE BEARS' 2015 TEAM PICTURE. THAT JUST HAPPENED TO BE THE FINAL SCORE OF BAYLOR'S WIN OVER TCU LAST YEAR. IT WAS THE ONLY LOSS OF THE YEAR FOR THE HORNED FROGS. DO YOU THINK TCU HAS FORGOTTEN? NOV. 28: OHIO STATE AT MICHIGAN (TBA) - TRUE, UCLA AT USC AND ALABAMA AT AUBURN ARE ON THE SAME DAY, BUT YOU NEVER GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME A JIM HARBAUGH-COACHED MICHIGAN TEAM WILL GO UP AGAINST AN URBAN MEYER-COACHED OHIO STATE TEAM. THE HOME FIELD IS PROBABLY MICHIGAN'S ONE AND ONLY ADVANTAGE. STILL, IT WILL BE FUN TO WATCH.

297	I MENTIONED IT LAST WEEK, BUT I'M OUT OF TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS IN SEATTLE AND CHICAGO (HOUSE HUNTING FOR OUR NEW PLACE AND SAYING GOODBYE TO MY CHILDHOOD HOME) AND I'VE RALLIED A FEW OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGER FRIENDS TO FILL IN FOR ME FOR THIS ENTIRE WEEK. THE FIRST GUEST BLOGGER IS LAUREN, WHOSE BLOG, POST GRAD IN PROGRESS, I FOUND THROUGH A LINK UP. SHE'S SUPER SWEET AND YOU'LL LOVE HER! HELLO, HELLO, THANKS SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME JULIE! IFEEL PRETTY HONORED, HUMBLED,ANDTHRILLEDBY JULIE'S GRACIOUS INVITATION FOR ME TO GUEST BLOG WHILE SHE'S AWAY. BUT BEFORE I GET AHEAD OF MYSELF LET'S START WITH AN INTRODUCTION. HI, I'M THE POST GRAD AND I BLOG AT POST GRAD IN PROGRESS. BUT MY NAME IS LAUREN AND I'M A NEW GRADUATE NAVIGATING THROUGH THE REAL WORLD TRYING TO DIG DEEP INTO WHAT MAKES ME TICK.THE REAL WORLD FOR ME BEING, MOVING TO A NEW CITY, STARTING A NEW JOB, AND MOLDING NEW FRIENDSHIPS ALONG THE WAY. MY BLOG IS MY HAPPY PLACE. IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT LIKE MY FAVORITE ANTHROPOLOGIE HACK COASTERS, WRITE RECIPES LIKE MY DELICIOUS MEATLOAF, AND DETAIL MY TRAVELS: RUSSIA, SAN DIEGO (PART 1), SAN DIEGO (PART 2), AND MY NEW ADVENTURE OF EAT, PRAY, LOVING IT IN EUROPE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGERS, ERIKA, DOES THIS SERIES OWNING IT WHERE YOU TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR QUIRKS AND WHAT MAKES YOU, WELL, YOU. EVERY TIME I READ A NEW POST ON A NEW BLOGGER I RACK MY BRAIN OF WHAT I DO THAT IS UNIQUE TO ME. ALAS, THIS MAKES THE PERFECT GUEST POST. I BASICALLY GET ALL MY JUNK ON THE TABLE FROM THE GET-GO! THIS COULD GO ONE OF TWO WAYS...SOME PEOPLE WILL RELATE OR JUST LAUGH AT MY CRAZINESS OR SOME PEOPLE MIGHT RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BUT HEY, I'MOWNINGIT. TODAY AND EVERYDAY. HI I'M LAUREN. 22 YEARS OLD AND I STILL SLEEP WITH MY BABY "BLANKET." YES, I PUT BLANKET IN QUOTATIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY, IT ISN'T A BLANKET ANYMORE. HE IS THEREMNANTOF A FORMER BLANKET TIED TOGETHER IN A RAG. ALSO, YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT I REFER TO MY BLANKET AS "HE" BECAUSE HE JUST ALWAYS HAS BEEN. WEIRD, I KNOW. I CALL HIM "T" BECAUSE MY BABYSITTER CALLED HIM MY TRANQUILIZER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND IT STUCK. HE'S A SENSE OF COMFORT AND MAY I SAY, AWELL-TRAVELEDBLANKET. GOOD GRACIOUS, I'VE LOST HALF OF JULIE'S READERS BY THIS POINT. I'M THE CLUMSIEST PERSON YOU'LL MEET BUT I'VE NEVER BROKEN A BONE AND I'VE NEVER HAD STITCHES. PICTURE ME KNOCKING ON WOOD AT THIS MOMENT. RAW POTATOES GIVE ME THE HEEBIE JEEBIES. I LOVE THE TASTE OF POTATOES...FRENCH FRIES, BAKED POTATOES, SCALLOPED POTATOES...BUT RAW POTATOES FREAK. ME. OUT.

WHEN I WAS IN 2ND GRADE AND MY FAMILY WENT TO JAMAICA I DECIDED IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO GET MY ENTIRE HEAD BRAIDED. I JUST GOT GLASSES, I BURN EASILY, AND I WAS GOING THROUGH AN AWKWARD STAGE SO LET'S JUST SAY THOSE PICTURES ARE ROUGH. BUT MY FRIENDS AND I GET A KICK OUT OF THEM. I THINK ILL STOP THERE. I WANT TO KEEP SOME OF MY CARDS CLOSE TO MY CHEST[SYMBOL]. BUT WEIRDNESS ASIDE, IM A GIRL WHO LOVES GOD, HER FAMILY & FRIENDS, BEING CREATIVE, AND TRAVELING.

298	THE FOOTY HQ - WA TEAM HAVE PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER TO TRY AND PREDICT THIS YEAR'S WINNER OF THE SWFL FAIREST AND BEST AWARD. THE 2015 HAYWARD MEDAL WILL BE AWARDED ON TUESDAY NIGHT WITH A NUMBER OF THE REGIONS BEST PLAYERS IN CONTENTION FOR THE PRESTIGIOUS HONOUR. THE SOUTH WEST FOOTBALL LEAGUE IN CONJUNCTION WITH DALE ALCOCK HOMES AND THE HAYWARD FAMILY HAVE PRESENTED THE LEAGUE'S FAIREST AND BEST PLAYER WITH THIS PRIZE SINCE 1946. THE TEAM FROM FOOTY HQ WA HAVE SPENT SOME TIME GOING THROUGH THEIR COVERAGE OF SEASON 2015 TO ESTABLISH WHO THE UMPIRES MAY HAVE AWARDED VOTES TO IN EACH GAME. IF OUR PREDICTIONS ARE CORRECT THEN CAREY PARKS GRAHAM JETTA WILL BE LEADING HALFWAY THROUGH THE COUNT BEFORE BUSSELTONS CHRIS KANE COMES STORMING HOME TO CLAIM THE MEDAL. JETTA HAS BEEN TOUTED AS A HAYWARD MEDAL FAVOURITE ALL SEASON WITH A NUMBER OF BEST ON GROUND PERFORMANCES. BUT WILL THE PANTHER'S STAR SHARE THE VOTES WITH GOAL-KICKING MACHINE MATT MARTIN TOO MANY TIMES TO FINISH WITH THE HIGHEST TOTAL? JOSH KRISPYN FROM THE HARVEY BULLS, BUSSELTON CAPTAIN DAN MCGINLAY AND LAST YEARS RUNNER UP CHRIS ATTHOWE FROM EATON ARE ALSO IN CONTENTION. HERE IS OUR PREDICTED TOP 10. BUSSELTONS CHRIS KANE HAD A QUIET START TO THE YEAR BUT AS THE YEAR WORE ON HE BEGAN TO SHINE. HE FINDS SPACE WELL AND IS EFFECTIVE WITH THE BALL WHEN IT IS IN HIS HANDS. HE COULD TOP SCORE VOTES IN A NUMBER OF GAMES ALONG WITH CAPTAIN DAN MCGINLAY. A DOMINANT FORCE AT CAREY PARK, GRAHAM JETTA HAS EXPLOSIVE PACE THROUGH THE MIDFIELD AND OFTEN LEAVES GREAT DEFENDERS IN HIS WAKE. HE HAS ALSO PROVIDED SOME HANDY SHOTS ON GOAL AND WE WILL HEAR G. JETTA, 3 VOTES A NUMBER OF TIMES ON TUESDAY NIGHT. CAREY PARKS MATT MARTIN DOES NOT HAVE A GREAT RECORD AT POLLING HAYWARD VOTES BUT HE MAY HAVE BEEN NOTICED BY THE UMPIRES THIS YEAR WITH ANOTHER OUTSTANDING GOAL KICKING PERFORMANCE. HE REGULARLY ENDS GAMES AVERAGING MORE THAN A GOAL A QUARTER AND IS CAPABLE OF LAYING BIG TACKLES. HARVEY CO-CAPTAIN JOSH KRISPYN HAS BEEN A BIG PART OF THE BULLS RESURGENCE THIS YEAR. HE CAN PLAY IN THE MIDFIELD, OR FORWARD, AND HAS A WAY OF GETTING THE HARD BALL. BUSSELTONS CAPTAIN AND A MODEL OF CONSISTENCY DAN MCGINLAY IS ANOTHER PLAYER WHO WILL POLL SLOWLY IN THE OPENING ROUNDS AND THEN EXPLODE. FOOTY HQ WA PREDICTS HIM TO POLL IN EVERY MATCH BETWEEN ROUNDS SIX AND 11 WITH THREE POSSIBLE BEST-ON-GROUND PERFORMANCES. A LATE INJURY MAY COST HIM THE VOTES REQUIRED TO WALK AWAY WITH THE MEDAL. EATONS CHRIS ATTHOWE FINISHED SECOND TO JESSE GRIBBLE IN LAST YEARS COUNT AND IS SURE TO ATTRACT THE UMPIRES PRAISE AGAIN THIS YEAR. HIS WORK RATE IS SECOND TO NONE AND HE IS A BIG PART OF HIS SIDE'S CONTINUED SUCCESS. SIMON PARRY IS A GREAT OVERHEAD MARK AND HAS HELPED LIFT HIS SIDE TO MORE SUCCESS THIS SEASON. HE IS A STALWART IN THE DONS MIDFIELD AND WHEN HE FIRES, HIS SIDE DOES TOO. EATONS JACE CORMACK IS A SMALL FORWARD WHO PUT IN A RIPPING PERFORMANCE AT THE LANDMARK COUNTRY FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS. LOCALLY HE HAS BEEN A FORCE ACROSS HALF FORWARD AND HAS HELPED HIS SIDE OUT OF SOME TIGHT SPOTS. HARVEYS DAN LEISHMAN HAS REAL PACE AND CAN KICK PLENTY OF GOALS. HE IS A REALLY VERSATILE PLAYER WHO USES HIS SKILLS ACROSS A NUMBER OF POSITIONS. EATONS KANE BLOXSIDGE HAS STEPPED INTO A SENIOR ROLE FOR HIS SIDE THIS SEASON AND LEADS BY EXAMPLE. HE FINDS SPACE WELL AND DELIVERS THE BALL TO HIS TEAMMATES WELL. FOOTY HQ WA WILL ONCE AGAIN PROVIDE LIVE COVERAGE OF THE EVENING. . TO KEEP UP WITH THE 2015 LIVE COVERAGE BE SURE TO . HERE IS HOW WE PREDICT EACH SIDE WILL POLL IN THE HAYWARD MEDAL COUNT. HAVE A LOOK TO SEE HOW MANY VOTES WE HAVE YOUR FAVOURITE PLAYER DOWN FOR.

299	LAST POST IN THIS THREAD I MENTIONED THAT I HAD OBTAINED SOME 'HONDURAN' MAHOGANY FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD ON THE CABINET. I WASN'T ENTIRELY PLEASED WITH THE MATERIAL I RECEIVED AS I HAD WANTED QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY, WHILE 7 OUT OF THE 10 BOARDS RECEIVED WERE NOT FITTING THAT DESCRIPTION AT ALL. I REALIZE NOW THAT QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY IS NOT GENERALLY WHAT WAS BEING CUT - LOGS ARE INVARIABLY SAWN THROUGH AND THROUGH - AND THUS QS STOCK IS LESS COMMONLY AVAILABLE THAN I HAD THOUGHT. SO, TRYING TO OBTAIN MORE (IN BULK) IN THE HOPE OF SCORING SOME MORE QUARTERSAWN BOARDS WAS NOT LOOKING PROMISING. NONE OF THE RETAILERS I SPOKE WITH SEEMED EVEN WILLING TO DO A SORT FOR A FEW BOARDS, AND FAIR ENOUGH. AFTER FURTHER RUMINATION, I DECIDED IT WOULD BE BEST TO CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SPECIES FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD, A SPECIES THAT WAS TYPICALLY CUT FOR QUARTERSAWN FROM THE GET-GO AND WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD MATCH FOR THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE REST OF THE CABINET. I'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED WOODS SUCH AS MAHOGANY, BLACK CHERRY, AND SWISS PEAR WOOD FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD. NONE OF THOSE WERE LIKELY TO FIT THE REQUIREMENTS I HAD IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION, SO I KEPT LOOKING. I FINALLY CAME ACROSS A SUITABLE MATERIAL, AND IT IS BOTANICALLY RELATED TO BUBINGA (WHICH IS GUIBORTIA TESSMANII OR GUIBORTIA PELLAGRINIANA OR GUIBORTIA DEMEUSEI). THIS IS A WOOD CALLED SHEDUA, AKA OVANGKOL, WHICH COMES FROM THE SPECIES GUIBORTIA EHIE. THIS IS A SOMEWHAT SMALLER TREE THAN THOSE SPECIES FROM WHICH BUBINGA IS OBTAINED, HOWEVER IN MANY RESPECTS SHEDUA SHARES THE SAME WORKING QUALITIES AS BUBINGA. THE WOOD COMES FROM WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES LIKE GABON AND CAMEROON, AND THE TREE IS MORE COMMONLY UTILIZED FOR ITS GUM RESIN, CALLED CONGO COPAL, THAN ITS TIMBER. THE TIMBER IS NOT VERY COMMONLY AVAILABLE, AND DOES SEEM TO FIND A CERTAIN FAVOR AMONG THE GUITAR-MAKING COMMUNITY. HERE'S A GUITAR WITH A SHEDUA BACK: (FROM:HTTP://WWW.GUITARBENCH.COM/2012/01/04/SHEDUA-TONEWOOD-PROFILE/) AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS A MORE BROWNISH CAST THAN BUBINGA, BUT SHARES THE BLACK STREAKS. COMPARING SHEDUA'S MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WITH BUBINGA, IT IS VERY CLOSE INDEED, BEING VERY SLIGHTLY LIGHTER AND DENSER, A LITTLE LOWER IN VOLUMETRIC CHANGE DUE TO MOISTURE CONTENT CHANGE, A SLIGHT BIT SOFTER IN TERMS OF CRUSHING STRENGTH AND A HAIR STIFFER IN BENDING STRENGTH (MODULUS OF ELASTICITY). I IMAGINE, THEREFORE, THAT IT SHOULD HAVE FAIRLY SIMILAR WORKING QUALITIES TO BUBINGA. THIS IMAGE FROM HEARNE HARDWOODS SHOWS THE VARIED APPEARANCE OF SHEDUA BASED ON THE GRAIN ORIENTATION: AS IT SO HAPPENS, HEARNE WAS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THE US WHICH HAD ANY STOCK OF SHEDUA AT ALL, LET ALONE QS AND/OR FIGURED STOCK. IN FACT, THEY HAD A DECENTLY SIZED STACK OF 12/4 MATERIAL, 6~12" WIDE, 16' LONG OR LONGER, AND SOME OF IT WAS QUARTERSAWN. CONSIDERING FEW OTHER RETAILERS HAVE ANY OF THIS MATERIAL, IT WAS AMAZING TO COME ACROSS SUCH NICE STOCK. THEY ALSO TOOK TIME TO REPLY TO MY EMAILS, AND SEND PICTURES, ONCE I HAD DEMONSTRATED SOLID INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL - - AND HAD GIVEN THEM MY CREDIT CARD INFO! THEY SEEM TO BE A WOOD RETAILER SPECIALIZING IN HIGH QUALITY AND RARE MATERIALS. THEY SENT ME SOME PICTURES OF A COUPLE OF BOARDS WHICH MATCHED THE REQUIREMENTS I GAVE THEM, SWABBED WITH ALCOHOL TO MAKE THE FIGURE A BIT CLEARER THOUGH NOT SHOWING THE TONE WHICH WILL BE OBTAINED WITH A PROPER FINISH: THEY WERE WONDERING IF I WAS SO DETERMINED TO HAVE QUARTERSAWN BECAUSE I WAS A LUTHIER, HOWEVER I LET THEM KNOW THEY WERE GUESSING WRONG. I DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC REASONS FOR WANTING QUARTERSAWN MATERIAL OF COURSE. THE GUY WHO SENT ME THE PICTURES STATED THAT THESE TWO BOARDS MIGHT BE THE NICEST IN THE ENTIRE PILE. I ASKED FOR A FOLLOW-UP PIC OF THE END GRAIN OF THE TWO BOARDS, TO CONFIRM THEY WERE WHAT I WANTED IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION: AND THE OTHER BOARD, ABOUT 12" WIDE: THE STICKS ARE HARD TO SCALE UNTIL YOU NOTICE THAT A FORKLIFT IS DOING THE LIFTING.... THE STOCK LOOKED GOOD TO ME. THE PRICE WAS STEEP, AT $35/BOARD FOOT, SO EACH OF THOSE BOARDS WAS $1400.00, HOWEVER I WAS ABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE COST SOMEWHAT BY SELLING A PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY-ACQUIRED MAHOGANY OFF TO ANOTHER WOODWORKER IN MY BUILDING. I ORDERED THOSE TWO BOARDS AND THEY SHOULD BE AT MY SHOP IN ANOTHER 3~4 DAYS. I THINK THIS WOOD WILL GO VERY NICELY WITH THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE BULK OF THE CABINET: I THINK THE CAD REPRESENTATION OF THE SHEDUA IS APPROXIMATE AT BEST. IN RECENT DAYS I HAVE REVISED THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DIVIDERS ON THE LOWER BANK OF DRAWERS, MAKING THEM STRAIGHT INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM MATCH THE DRAWER CURVES, AND RECESSING THEM BACK SLIGHTLY - THIS FOR AMONG OTHER REASONS, TO INCREASE THE SHADOW LINE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE CURVED DRAWERS AND THE SURROUNDING FRAMEWORK: THE DIVIDER'S OUTER ARRISES WILL ADDITIONALLY BE CHAMFERED. THE DRAWERS THEMSELVES WILL HAVE A BEADED PERIMETER DETAIL, AND HAVE THE DRAWER SIDEWALL THROUGH- TENONS POKING OUT, NEITHER OF WHICH IS NOT ILLUSTRATED YET, AND THE HANDLE DESIGN FOR THE DRAWERS REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION. LIKEWISE, THE UPPER SET OF DRAWERS AND DOORS REMAINS JUST A FRONTAL PLANE AT THE MOMENT WITH NO ALLOWANCE FOR SET BACK, CHAMFERING, ETC.. GETTING THERE! THANKS FOR VISITING THE CARPENTRY WAY. GOT SOME MACHINE'S COMING SOON SO I AM WORKING ON GETTING MY SHOP READY FOR THAT - THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE SUBJECT OF THE NEXT POST.
300	IN 2011 SFFS DEBT WAS $112 MILLION BUT IT BALLOONED TO $387M. AN AGGRESSIVE REPAYMENT PLAN WAS EXPECTED THIS YEAR TO SHRINK IT TO ABOUT $150 MILLION. SFF CHAIRMAN ROB HEWETT SAID THE MARKET PANICKED TO SECURE LAMBS FOLLOWING THAT HORROR SNOWSTORM BUT BY JANUARY 2012 PRICES COLLAPSED AND MARKETS SLOWED, LEADING TO A MASSIVE BUILD-UP OF INVENTORY. THAT INVENTORY HAD TO BE FUNDED, LEAVING SFF, IN PARTICULAR, BADLY EXPOSED. COLLECTIVELY, THE MEAT INDUSTRY LOST $200M THAT YEAR, HE SAID. SFF WAS ALSO COMMITTED TO REBUILDING ITS FIRE-DAMAGED TE AROHA BEEF WORKS, DECIDING TO INVEST $30M MORE THAN THE INSURANCE PAYOUT TO MAKE IT A STATE-OF-THE-ART PLANT. IT ALSO TRIED TO LOCK IN SUPPLY BY OFFERING FARMERS WHAT PROVED TO BE GENEROUS, LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR SHEEP MEAT AND BULL BEEF. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS CONTRACTING SUPPLY COST SFF $50M. THOSE COMMITMENTS HAVE FINALLY BEEN WOUND DOWN. OTHER COMMENTATORS ALSO POINT TO THE PROTRACTED AND BITTER 2004 BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF RICHMOND WHICH COST $150M AND CREATED AN ABUNDANCE OF ANIMOSITY AMONG NORTH ISLAND FARMERS. WHILE DEBT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE, HEWETT SAID A REVIEW IDENTIFIED ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE AS A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY. SPECIFICALLY, BANKS WANTED A STRONGER DEBT-EQUITY RATIO BECAUSE OF THEIR RISK EXPOSURE. HEWETT SAID THE ASSOCIATED UNCERTAINTY EVERY YEAR AFFECTED STAFF MORALE, CONFIDENCE AND THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND PLANS. THE MOVE TO CONSUMER-READY PRODUCTS IN ITS PLATE TO PASTURE STRATEGY HAS ALSO BEEN COSTLY AND WHILE SALES CONTRIBUTE 5% OF REVENUE, IT HAS BEEN A LONG PROCESS REQUIRING ONGOING INVESTMENT OF UP TO $4M A YEAR. SFF HAS TWICE PREVIOUSLY SOUGHT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO REDUCE DEBT, FUND NEW TECHNOLOGY AND ITS PLATE TO PASTURE CONSUMER RETAIL PACK STRATEGY. IN 2008 SHAREHOLDERS AGREED TO SELL HALF THE COMPANY TO PGG WRIGHTSON IN A $220M DEAL BROKERED BY THE LATE CRAIG NORGATE AND TWO DUNEDIN BUSINESS BROTHERS BAIRD AND ALAN MCCONNON. ONE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT MOST BANKS DO NOT WANT TO LEND TERM DEBT TO MEAT COMPANIES. ROSS HYLAND MIE THE DEAL WOULD HAVE SEEN PGG WRIGHTSON TAKE A HALF SHARE IN THE COMPANY AND SOURCE STOCK FOR SFF, ALLOWING THE MEAT CO-OPERATIVE TO RETIRE DEBT, SAVING IT $20M A YEAR IN INTEREST COSTS, AND INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGY AND MARKETING. BUT THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS INTERVENED AND PGG WRIGHTSON COULDNT RAISE THE MONEY. A SETTLEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED IN WHICH PGG WRIGHTSON PAID SFF $25M AND ISSUED IT WITH 10M ORDINARY SHARES. IRONICALLY, THE MONEY WAS SOURCED FROM SOUTH CANTERBURY FINANCE, WHICH LATER COLLAPSED BECAUSE OF DEBT. A YEAR LATER SFF WENT TO SHAREHOLDERS WITH A NEW CAPITAL STRUCTURE OFFER, SEEKING $80M BUT HOPING FOR $128M. IT SECURED JUST $22M. THE FUNDS WOULD HAVE RETIRED $70M IN MATURING BONDS AND ALLOWED INVESTMENT OF BETWEEN $25M AND $30M FOR X-RAY CARCASE IMAGING AND ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGY. ON AT LEAST TWO OCCASIONS SERIOUS CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO A MERGER WITH ALLIANCE GROUP. SFF WALKED AWAY FROM MERGER TALKS WITH ALLIANCE IN 2007 WHEN THE INVERCARGILL CO-OPERATIVE VALUED SFF AT VIRTUALLY NOTHING. A YEAR LATER SFF WALKED AWAY AGAIN FROM A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD HAVE LOCKED UP ABOUT 80% OF THE NATIONS RED MEAT PROCESSING SAYING CONCESSIONS ALLOWING OTHER COMPANIES TO EXEMPT PRODUCT WOULD HAVE UNDERMINED ITS EFFECTIVENESS. THAT LACK OF PROFITABILITY AND PERCEIVED RISK PLAGUES THE MEAT INDUSTRY AND LIMITS ITS ABILITY TO SECURE LONG-TERM FUNDING, MEAT INDUSTRY EXCELLENCE ADVISER ROSS HYLAND SAYS. ONE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT MOST BANKS DO NOT WANT TO LEND TERM DEBT TO MEAT COMPANIES. AS A RESULT COMPANIES WERE LIMITED IN WHERE THEY COULD SOURCE FUNDING AND WERE FORCED TO PAY PREMIUM INTEREST RATES, HE SAID. BECAUSE OF ITS SCALE, LACK OF RISK BY HAVING CONTRACTED SUPPLY AND GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS, INVESTORS VIEWED FONTERRA DIFFERENTLY AND IT WASNT RELIANT ON TRADING BANKS BUT COULD GET FUNDING, SUCH AS BONDS, FROM INTERNATIONAL EQUITY MARKETS. HYLAND SAID UNPAID SEASONAL FINANCE WAS OFTEN ROLLED OVER INTO TERM DEBT WHICH WAS PAID DOWN IN A GOOD YEAR BUT LOW MARGINS MEANT IT BUILT UP AGAIN.
301	THE ISSUE: THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE BY THE END OF THE MONTH WHETHER IT WILL PUT THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST. WE BELIEVE: FISH AND WILDLIFE SHOULD HOLD OFF AND LET CURRENT CONSERVATION EFFORTS WORK. WE DO THINK THE AGENCY SHOULD MAINTAIN ITS THREAT AS A MEANS TO KEEP THOSE PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD. TELL US WHAT YOU THINK: CONTACT US VIA EMAIL AT OPINION@WYOMINGNEWS.COM . IT IS BEING CALLED "THE LARGEST CONSERVATION EFFORT EVER UNDERTAKEN." AND IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. BUT SUPPORTERS OF THE 11-STATE EFFORT TO SAVE THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE SAY THEY WILL LOSE MUCH OF THEIR MOMENTUM - AND PERHAPS THE BIRD ITSELF - IF THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE LISTS IT AS ENDANGERED LATER THIS MONTH. WE AGREE. IN TRUTH, JUST THE THREAT OF THAT LISTING HAS DRIVEN A BROAD COALITION OF STATE AGENCIES, PRIVATE INDUSTRY, LANDOWNERS AND NONPROFIT GROUPS TO COMMENDABLY JOIN HANDS, MAKE COMPROMISES AND SET IN PLACE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS TO SAVE THE GROUSE. TAKE THAT THREAT AWAY, OR PUT THE AUTHORITY FOR CONTROLLING THE PROCESS INTO FEDERAL HANDS - AND PERHAPS COMPLICATE AND OVER-REGULATE THE EFFORT - AND MANY OF THEM SIMPLY WILL WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE. AT STAKE IN THIS DISCUSSION IS A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY DEVELOPED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENTS OF INTERIOR AND AGRICULTURE TO MANAGE THE GROUSE ON BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT AND FOREST SERVICE LAND. IT INCORPORATES THE BATTLE PLANS DEVELOPED SEPARATELY IN RECENT YEARS BY THE 11 STATES - STRETCHING FROM WYOMING TO CALIFORNIA AND NORTHWARD TO THE CANADIAN BORDER - IN THE BIRDS' RANGE. (WYOMING HAS BEEN AMONG THE LEADERS IN THE PROCESS, MAINLY BECAUSE MOST OF THE BIRDS RESIDE WITHIN ITS BORDERS. A FEDERAL LISTING COULD HAVE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES HERE, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF RESTRICTING THE ESSENTIAL ENERGY INDUSTRY.) THE GOAL OF THE BLM EFFORT IS TO SAVE THE BIRD BY PROTECTING AND BUILDING UP ITS SAGEBRUSH HABITAT. ITS RANGE HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM 500,000 TO 250,000 SQUARE MILES, AND ITS NUMBERS HAVE DROPPED FROM 16 MILLION, BY SOME ESTIMATES, TO ABOUT 400,000. AND SCIENTISTS BELIEVE ITS NUMBERS CONTINUE TO DIP. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE PLANS SET ASIDE "CORE AREAS," WHERE DEVELOPMENT IS NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE OR WHERE WORK STOPPAGES OCCUR AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR, SUCH AS IN MATING SEASON. OTHER EFFORTS ALSO ARE MADE TO PROTECT THE GROUSE IN THESE ESSENTIAL AREAS, SUCH AS DISCOURAGING WIND DEVELOPMENT OR BANNING OIL AND GAS PIPELINES AND TRANSMISSION LINES. BUT THERE ARE OTHER BENEFITS FROM THESE EFFORTS. THE GROUSE IS AN "UMBRELLA SPECIES." THAT MEANS IT SHARES ITS HABITAT WITH SOME 350 OTHER SPECIES, SEVERAL OF WHICH ALSO MAY BE HEADED FOR LISTING BY THE FEDS. BOOSTING THE GROUSE'S HABITAT HELPS THEM AS WELL. ONE BENEFICIARY OF IMPROVED SAGEBRUSH THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO WYOMINGITES' HEARTS IS THE MULE DEER, WHICH WINTERS THERE. THE DEER'S NUMBERS ALSO ARE ON THE DECLINE IN THE COWBOY STATE. OUR HOPE IS THAT FISH AND WILDLIFE WILL HOLD OFF ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING AND ALLOW THESE BLM PLANS TO BE PUT INTO ACTION. THE AGENCY SHOULD MAINTAIN THE THREAT OF LISTING, PERHAPS CREATING TIMELINES FOR REVIEWING OUTCOMES, IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM MOVING FORWARD. BUT IF THE PLANS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THIS ACTUALLY COULD SET A NEW DIRECTION FOR WORKING WITH THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT, RATHER THAN ALL SIDES ACTING AS ADVERSARIES. ADDITIONALLY, THIS NEWSPAPER URGES WYOMING'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO BACK OFF OF ITS EFFORTS TO FORESTALL FEDERAL SAGE GROUSE ACTION THROUGH LEGISLATION. THAT MIGHT DELAY A LISTING, BUT IT ALSO COULD IMPLODE THESE COALITIONS BY REMOVING THEIR INCENTIVE TO WORK FOR THE BIRD AND FOR THEIR STATES. AND WITHOUT THESE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS, THE GROUSE THEN COULD END UP IN A WORSE PLACE AFTER A FEDERAL MORATORIUM, SINCE EFFORTS TO BUILD THEIR HABITAT WOULD HAVE FALTERED. AND THAT WOULD VIRTUALLY GUARANTEE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING DOWN THE ROAD. WE ENCOURAGE BOTH CONGRESS AND THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE TO LET THIS INNOVATIVE CONSERVATION EFFORT WORK. IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO WASTE THE TIME AND MONEY SPENT ALREADY TO SAVE THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE WHEN IT VERY WELL COULD YIELD REAL FRUIT IN THE YEARS AHEAD.

PHOTO: BOB LUCKEY JR. / HEARST CONNECTICUT MEDIA 25 YEARS OF FINDING THE RIGHT BOOK IN GREENWICH BACK TO GALLERY DIANE GARRETT BELIEVES THE SECRET TO BUSINESS SUCCESS IS SIMPLE. ITS ONE CUSTOMER AT A TIME, GARRETT SAID. NO BELLS AND WHISTLES. GARRETT IS CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF HER STORE, DIANES BOOKS, THIS YEAR. ITS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR THE CANADA NATIVE WHO WAS SHOCKED WHEN SHE REALIZED THERE WAS NO CHILDRENS BOOK STORE IN TOWN WHEN SHE MOVED TO GREENWICH THREE DECADES AGO. I COULDNT BELIEVE THAT IN THIS FABULOUS TOWN THERE WAS NO CHILDRENS BOOKSTORE, GARRETT SAID. THERE WERE OTHER BOOKSTORES BUT NONE FOR CHILDREN AND I BELIEVE IF WHOLE FAMILIES DONT READ WE DONT RAISE READERS, SO I KNEW THERE WAS A VOID IN TOWN. GARRETT, WHO HAS A MASTERS IN LIBRARY SCIENCE, SAID SHE WAS TOLD MORE THAN ONCE SHE WAS CRAZY FOR WANTING TO OPEN A BOOKSTORE, BUT SHE HAD A PLAN FOR THE FAMILY BOOKSTORE AND WASNT ABOUT TO GIVE UP. SHE OPENED THE STORE ON GRIGG STREET, JUST OFF GREENWICH AVENUE, ON NOV. 3. SHE WANTED THE STORE TO BE A SPECIAL PLACE FOR CUSTOMERS TO CELEBRATE BOOKS, AND SHE WANTED EVERYONE IN HER STORE TO BE AN EXPERT IN SOME WAY IN ORDER TO HELP PEOPLE FIND THE PERFECT BOOK. THE FOUR CS COMPASSION, CURIOSITY, COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ARE THE RULES BY WHICH SHE RUNS HER BUSINESS, GARRETT SAID. EARLIER THIS YEAR, DIANE WAS AWARDED THE MALCOLM S. PRAY EXCELLENCE IN BUSINESS AWARD BY THE GREENWICH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE . THE TWO YEAR OLD AWARD IS GIVEN TO BUSINESS OWNERS WHO DO A LOT OF COMMUNITY SERVICE. WINNING THE AWARD, GARRETT SAID, WAS A GREAT WAY TO KICK OFF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION. THE TIMING WAS GREAT, GARRETT SAID. ITS A GREAT THING TO BE HERE 25 YEARS AND STILL BE HAVING SO MUCH FUN, AND THE BOOKS JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER. JEANNIE GILLESPIE HAS WORKED FOR GARRETT FOR 10 YEARS AND SAID GARRETTS EXPERTISE AND PASSION ARE WHAT MAKES THE STORE SUCCESSFUL AND A GREAT PLACE TO WORK. SHES A TOWN TREASURE, GILLESPIE SAID. SHE REALLY ADDS THAT PERSONAL TOUCH AND PEOPLE TRUST HER OPINION. I WORKED ON THE PUBLISHING SIDE AND BOOKSTORES ARE PART OF THE PUBLISHING ECOSYSTEM. DIANE IS PRETTY SPECIAL TO BE A PART OF THAT. KRISTIN MURPHY , 24, HAS BEEN A LOYAL DIANES BOOKS CUSTOMER THROUGHOUT HER LIFE. EVEN THOUGH SHES GONE OFF TO COLLEGE AND HAS MOVED TO RHODE ISLAND, SHE STILL MAKES A POINT TO STOP IN THE STORE ANYTIME SHES BACK IN GREENWICH. SHE SAID SHE PLANS TO COME BACK TO GREENWICH TO VISIT FOR THE WEEKEND OF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION. I HAVE A VERY DISTINCT MEMORY OF BUYING FERDINAND THE BULL AT DIANES AND TAKING IT TO MY FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN, MURPHY SAID. ITS JUST A REALLY SPECIAL PLACE, ESPECIALLY THE CHILDRENS SECTION. I STILL GO TO DIANES FOR RECOMMENDATIONS AND TO VISIT WHENEVER IM IN TOWN. THE STAFF IS JUST AMAZING. ITS A MAGICAL PLACE. OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS, DIANES BOOKS HAS EXPANDED FOUR TIMES AS THE BOOK BUSINESS HAS EVOLVED AND THE PUBLISHING WORLD HAS CONTINUED PUTTING OUT MORE AND MORE BOOKS. GARRETT SAID THE STORE USED TO HOST READINGS BUT DUE TO THE EXPANDED INVENTORY THEY SIMPLY DONT HAVE THE SPACE ANYMORE AND THE READINGS ARE HOSTED ELSEWHERE. BUT THE MEMORIES OF THOSE EARLY READINGS ARE CONTAINED IN THE WALLS OF DIANES WHERE SHE HAD VISITING AUTHORS SIGN THEIR NAME. GARRETT AND HER STAFF AT DIANES BOOKS WHO SHE REFERS TO AS DIANES DAZZLING DIVAS WILL CELEBRATE THE LANDMARK ANNIVERSARY ON HALLOWEEN, AS THEY HAVE FOR THEIR 15TH AND 20TH ANNIVERSARIES. THEY HAVE PLANS TO DRESS UP AND INVITE THE COMMUNITY TO CELEBRATE WITH THEM. THERE WILL BE A PARTY WITH FACE PAINTING AND RAFFLES, AND OF COURSE, GEARED TOWARD THE KIDS FOR WHOM SHE STARTED IT ALL. SURVIVING 25 YEARS JUST OFF THE EVER-CHANGING GREENWICH AVENUE IS NO SMALL FEAT FOR A SMALL BUSINESS, BUT GARRETT SAID SHE HAS NO PLANS TO MOVE THE STORE OR RETIRE ANYTIME SOON. I PLAN TO BE HERE UNTIL I CANT ANYMORE, GARRETT SAID. I JUST LOVE WHAT I DO. KKRASSELT@SCNI.COM; 203-625-4411; TWITTER: @KAITLYNKRASSELT

307	SACRAMENTO, CALIF. EASTERN WASHINGTONS YOUNG DEFENSE DIDNT EXACTLY COME OF AGE SATURDAY NIGHT, BUT THERE WAS A DISCERNIBLE GROWTHSPURT. INDEED, DEFENSE MADE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE EAGLES 28-20 BIG SKY CONFERENCE WIN OVER SACRAMENTO STATE, A GAME THAT WAS THREATENING TO GET OUT OF HAND EARLY IN THE SECONDHALF. THATS WHEN THE EAGLES, ALREADY TRAILING 20-7, WERE THREATENED WITH DISASTER AFTER RUNNING BACK JABARI WILSON FUMBLED ON THE EAGLES FIRST PLAY FROM SCRIMMAGE IN THE HALF TO SET UP THE HORNETS AT THE EWU40-YARD-LINE. TO THAT POINT AGAINST A TEAM THAT HAD SCORED JUST TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN ITS PREVIOUS NINE QUARTERS EASTERN HAD GIVEN UP 291 YARDS, INCLUDING AN EPIC, 18-PLAY DRIVE IN THE SECOND QUARTER THAT SENT THE EAGLES DOWN BY TWO SCORES AGAINST A CONFERENCE OPPONENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER AYEAR. IN OTHER WORDS, MORE OF THE SAME FROM A YOUNG GROUP THAT HAD GIVEN UP AN AVERAGE OF 589 YARDS IN EWUS FIRST THREEGAMES. BUT THE EAGLES MADE THE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS SOME OF THEM SCHEMATIC, MORE OF THEM MENTAL BUT MOST OF THEM ONDEFENSE. IMMEDIATELY AFTER WILSONS FUMBLE, COACH BEAU BALDWIN SAID HE NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN HISDEFENSE. THERE WAS JUST A LOOK IN THEIR EYES AFTER THAT PLAY HAPPENED, BALDWIN SAID. YOU KNEW, NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE WOULD FIGHT TO COME BACK, THERE WOULD BE SOME THINGS THAT GO WRONG YOU JUST DONT WANT IT TO HAPPEN ON YOUR FIRST OFFENSIVEPLAY. THREE PLAYS LATER, THE HORNETS PUNTED AND EASTERN QUARTERBACK JORDAN WEST HIT KENDRICK BOURNE FOR A 98-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS THAT CUT THE DEFICIT TO 20-14. THAT PLAY MAY HAVE TURNED THE GAME AROUND, BUT IT WAS EASTERNS DEFENSE MADE ITPOSSIBLE. AT HALFTIME, WE KNEW WE HAD TO PICK IT UP ON DEFENSE, SAID ROVERBACK COLE KARSTETTER, A REDSHIRT FRESHMAN FROM FERRIS AND ONE OF SIX UNDERCLASSMEN WHO STARTED SATURDAYNIGHT. WE JUST TOOK IT ONE SERIES AT A TIME, AND ONCE THE MOMENTUM STARTED ROLLING, WE PLAYED MORE PHYSICAL AND THEY (SAC STATE) SHUT DOWN, SAID KARSTETTER, WHO FINISHED WITH SEVEN TACKLES, THIRD-MOST ON THE TEAM BEHIND VETERANS MIQUIYAH ZAMORA AND MILESWEATHEROY. THE RESULT WAS AN EPIC THIRD QUARTER IN WHICH THE EAGLES OUTGAINED THE HORNETS 278-18 AND HELD THEM TO ONE FIRST DOWN WHILE TURNING A 20-7 DEFICIT INTO A 28-20 ADVANTAGE AT THE END OF THEQUARTER. THE DEFENSE DIDNT STOP THERE. EASTERN MANAGED JUST 83 YARDS OF OFFENSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FAILED TO SCORE IN ITS LAST THREE POSSESSIONS, BUT SAC STATE MANAGED ONLY 50 AND NEVER THREATENED TO GET INTO THE ENDZONE.
308	IANS WASHINGTON INDIA HAS INVITED US COMPANIES TO INVEST IN THE INDIAN ENERGY SECTOR AS INDIA-US COLLABORATION OFFERED GREAT POTENTIAL, IN VIEW OF INDIAS ENORMOUS ENERGY NEEDS AND THE US RESOURCES, CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGY.  DEAN PEACE WAS FINED $25,000 FOR THE ANIMAL CRUELTY CHARGES, AND $3000 FOR LODDON SHIRE CHARGES. THE INVITATION WAS EXTENDED BY MINISTER OF STATE FOR POWER PIYUSH GOYAL AT THE INDIA-US MINISTERIAL ENERGY DIALOGUE CO-CHAIRED BY HIM AND THE US ENERGY SECRETARY ERNEST MONIZ HERE MONDAY. HE ALSO INVITED US FIRMS TO PARTICIPATE IN INDIAS UNCONVENTIONAL HYDROCARBONS SECTOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION OF ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES SUCH AS SHALE OIL, SHALE GAS AND GAS HYDRATES. DURING THE DIALOGUE, THE TWO SIDES REVIEWED THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE SIX WORKING GROUPS OF THE ENERGY DIALOGUE AND IDENTIFIED NEW AREAS FOR COOPERATION, ACCORDING TO AN INDIAN EMBASSY MEDIA RELEASE. THEY ALSO REVIEWED VARIOUS ENERGY RELATED ISSUES AGREED IN THE INDIA-US JOINT STATEMENT DURING PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAS VISIT TO INDIA IN JANUARY.  PEAK POSITIONS 17. GOYAL STRESSED THE INDIAN GOVERNMENTS GOAL OF PROVIDING 247 POWER ACROSS INDIA BY 2019 BY CREATING COST EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WAS SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE OF CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS. STRESSING INDIAS COMMITMENT TO PURSUE A GREEN PATH TO GROWTH, HE SPOKE OF INDIAS AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR DEPLOYMENT OF 175 GW RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITIES BY 2022. THESE WOULD INCLUDE 100 GW OF SOLAR AND 60 GW OF WIND, WHICH MAY REQUIRE INVESTMENT OF AROUND $150 BILLION IN THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. GOYAL ALSO EXPOUNDED ON THE GOVERNMENTS OBJECTIVE OF CONSTRUCTION OF 100 SMART CITIES WHICH WOULD INCLUDE IN ITS BLUEPRINT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS FOR POWER GENERATION, USAGE OF RENEWABLE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY TECHNOLOGIES AND COMPREHENSIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME.  IT WAS AGREED TO EXPLORE ADDITION OF SMART GRIDS AN ENERGY STORAGE FOR GRID APPLICATION AS THE FOURTH STREAM UNDER PARTNERSHIP TO ADVANCE CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH (PACE R) THE NEED TO DEVELOP A ROBUST ENERGY DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO DEVELOP BETTER SIMULATION OF THE ENERGY SCENARIO IN INDIA IN THE FUTURE WAS ALSO RECOGNISED. THE WORKING GROUP ON COAL IDENTIFIED SOME AREAS OF COAL MINING WHERE BOTHCOUNTRIES COULD COLLABORATE. IT WAS RECOGNISED THAT INDIA HAD PROVEN RESERVES OF SHALE GAS AND US HAD WELL DEVELOPED EXPERTISE FOR SHALE GAS EXTRACTION. COLLABORATION IN THE AREA OF FRACKING OF SHALE GAS, ESPECIALLY WATER LESS FRACKING IN INDIA WERE IDENTIFIED AS AREAS OF FUTURE COOPERATION UNDER THE ENERGY DIALOGUE. DISCUSSIONS WERE ALSO HELD IN THE WORKING GROUPS ON FINANCING OF CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS ON INNOVATIVE FINANCING FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY MICROFINANCE AND MICRO ENTERPRISES. IT WAS RECOGNISED THAT COAL BASED POWER PLANTS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE MAINSTAY OF INDIAS ELECTRICITY GENERATION SOURCE IN THE C OMING DECADES. HOWEVER, THE INDIAN DELEGATION URGED THE US TO SHARE TECHNOLOGY RELATED TO SUPERCRITICAL COAL PLANTS AS WELL AS SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND TOOLS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND CARBON FOOTPRINT OF EXISTING POWER PLANTS.
309	TOM ELLIS IN LONDON, AUGUST 2015. PHOTOS: MATT HOLYOAK . STYLING: NIC JOTTKANDT . GROOMING: LARRY KING FOR STREETERS. PHOTO ASSISTANTS: JACK DONCASTER AND SAM WILSON. IN LUCIFER , FOX'S 2016 DRAMEDY BASED ON THE GRAPHIC NOVELS BY NEIL GAIMAN, THE DEVIL IS MORE MISCHIEVOUS THAN CRUEL. HE LOOKS A BIT LIKE JAMES BONDOR PERHAPS A VILLAIN OUT OF JAGUAR'S "IT'S GOOD TO BE BAD" COMMERCIAL AND HAS THE MORALS OF A DEBAUCHED INVESTMENT BANKER (ALBEIT WITH A LITTLE MORE HEART). "I SUPPOSE HE'S KIND OF A CADDISH FIGURE," SAYS TOM ELLIS, WHO STARS AS LUCIFER MORNINGSTAR. "FOR ME, IT WAS APPARENT THAT HE WAS FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE CHARACTERS. HE READ LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A HIGH-STYLE THEATER PLAY BY OSCAR WILDE OR NOEL COWARD," HE CONTINUES. "THAT GIVE ME THE BACKBONE OF WHAT I WAS DOING, INFUSED WITH A BIT OF ROCK 'N' ROLL AND MICK JAGGER. YOU'VE GOT THIS KIND OF FLAMBOYANT CHARACTER AT THE END OF IT." NOW IN HIS MID-30S, ELLIS GREW UP IN THE U.K. AND WENT TO DRAMA SCHOOL AT THE ROYAL SCOTTISH ACADEMY IN GLASGOW WITH JAMES MCAVOY, SAM HEUGHAN , AND LAURA DONNELLY , AMONG OTHERS. HE'S SPENT MUCH OF HIS 15-YEAR CAREER ON TELEVISION; LAST YEAR HE STARRED AS ANOTHER SUAVE BAD-BOY ON U.S.A.'S RUSH , AND, FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, HE'S PLAYED GARY PRESTON IN THE CULT BRITISH COMEDY MIRANDA . WE RECENTLY SPOKE WITH ELLIS VIA THE PHONE. EMMA BROWN: CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU GOT INVOLVED IN LUCIFER ? TOM ELLIS: IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW SCRIPTS THAT I READ DURING PILOT SEASON THIS YEAR THAT, AS SOON AS I READ IT, I SAID, "THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO." IT WAS MUCH FUNNIER THAN ANYTHING THAT I HAD READ. I MET LEN WISEMAN, WHO HAD COME ON BOARD AS THE DIRECTOR. IT WAS INSTANTANEOUS FOR ME FROM THAT MOMENT. HE MADE IT QUITE APPARENT THAT HE WANTED ME TO DO IT, AND I REALLY WANTED TO DO THE PROJECT, SO IT WAS JUST ABOUT GETTING THE STUDIO AND EVERYONE ON BOARD. THAT CAME QUITE QUICKLY AS WELL. PILOT SEASON'S SUCH A STRANGE TIME. YOU GET SUCH A CONCENTRATED AMOUNT OF SCRIPTS. A LOT OF THEM BECOME WHITE NOISE AFTER A WHILE. WHEN SOMETHING REALLY POPS, IT BECOMES APPARENT VERY QUICKLY. I'M QUITE INSTINCTIVE ABOUT THAT. I KNOW, NORMALLY BY ABOUT 10 PAGES IN, WHETHER I WANT TO DO SOMETHING OR NOT. BROWN: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST PILOT SEASON? ELLIS: IT WAS BACK IN 2008. I DID A PILOT FOR FOX. THE MORE YOU DO, THE MORE YOU LEARN ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO GET OUT THE EXPERIENCE. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GO THERE JUST TO GET A JOB AND THAT'S NOT MY MOTIVATION ANY MORE. I WANT TO BE DOING THE RIGHT JOB. BROWN: WHEN DID YOU HAVE THAT REALIZATIONTHAT YOU WANTED TO DO THE RIGHT JOB? ELLIS: I'VE BEEN ACTING FOR 15 YEARS NOW, AND THE MORE YOU DO, THE MORE CONFIDENCE YOU GET ABOUT "THIS IS MY CAREER AND THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING." SINCE I'VE STARTED COMING TO THE STATES, I'VE HAD A REALLY GREAT RESPONSE. IT'S GIVEN ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE TO BE MORE JUDICIOUS ABOUT MY OWN CHOICES. I IMAGINE THAT'S PROBABLY HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. I'VE SORT OF GROWN INTO A MAN MYSELF. BROWN: DO YOU COME FROM AN ARTISTIC FAMILY? WAS BEING AN ACTOR A FEASIBLE GOAL FOR YOU? ELLIS: MY MUM WAS A MUSIC TEACHER. I'VE GOT THREE SISTERS AND WE ALL PLAYED INSTRUMENTS WHEN WE WERE KIDS. BROWN: WHAT DID YOU PLAY? ELLIS: I STARTED ON THE TRUMPET AND THEN I UPGRADED TO THE FRENCH HORN. I PLAYED IN ORCHESTRAS MY ENTIRE TEENAGE YEARS. BUT, ON THE DRAMA FRONT, NO, NOT REALLY. MY DAD, STRANGELY ENOUGH FOR THIS JOB, WAS A BAPTIST PASTOR, SO I GREW UP IN THE CHURCH AS WELL. I SUPPOSE THERE IS A DRAMATIC ELEMENT TO HIS JOB, AND HE ENJOYED DOING AMATEUR OPERATICS. BROWN: WERE YOU IN A NATIVITY PLAY? ELLIS: I WAS IN A NATIVITY PLAY, BUT BEING A SON OF THE PASTOR, I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO PLAY JOSEPH OR ANY OF THE BIG PARTS FOR POLITICAL REASONS. BROWN: WHAT DOES YOU FAMILY THINK OF THIS SHOW? ELLIS: THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET; THEY'VE SEEN THE TRAILER. THEY'RE ALL THRILLED THAT I'M DOING IT. IT'S ALREADY THROWN UP A BIT OF DEBATE, THIS SHOW. I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT TAKE THE SHOW IN THE SPIRIT IT'S MEANT TO BE RECEIVED WILL GET THE MOST OUT OF IT. ANYONE THAT'S PREDICTING IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING BEFORE EVEN SEEING IT IS A BIT FOOLISH, IN MY VIEW. THE SHOW CERTAINLY IS NOT A BIG THEOLOGICAL DEBATE. MORE THAN ANYTHING, I'D SAY THIS SHOW IS A STORY OF REDEMPTION. OBVIOUSLY ONE OF OUR MAIN SOURCE MATERIALS WAS THE GRAPHIC NOVEL THAT IT WAS BASED ON. BROWN: WERE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE GRAPHIC NOVEL BEFOREHAND? ELLIS: I WASN'T AT ALL ACTUALLY. I HAVE TO EMBARRASSINGLY ADMIT, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS BASED ON A GRAPHIC NOVEL UNTIL AFTER I GOT THE JOB AND I READ IT ON DEADLINE . I'M KIND OF GLAD I DIDN'T, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T AFFECT MY CHOICES AT FIRST. BROWN: WHEN YOU TOLD YOUR PARENTS YOU WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR, WHAT WAS THEIR REACTION? ELLIS: IT WAS QUITE LATE. IT WASN'T LIKE I TOLD THEM THIS WHEN I WAS 12 AND BLINDLY PUT THE REST OF MY EDUCATION TO ONE SIDE; IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I SORT OF STUMBLED ACROSS IN MY LATER SCHOOL YEARS. THEY WERE INFORMED BY MY DRAMA TEACHER, WHO I'M STILL FRIENDS WITH ACTUALLY. THERE WAS A PARENTS' EVENING AND THEY CAME IN AND MET HER, AND SHE WAS LIKE, "YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT LETTING TOM GO TO DRAMA SCHOOL." IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT SOMEONE HAD REALLY DONE THAT. SO THEY WERE QUIETLY SUPPORTIVE; THEY WERE NEVER STARRY PARENTS, GOING, "OUR KID'S GOING TO BE SUCH-AND-SUCH." THEY JUST LET ME GET ON WITH IT, AND I APPRECIATED THAT BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN ME A GOOD SORT OF WORK ETHIC. I DON'T FEEL ENTITLED TO ANYTHING. BROWN: WHAT MADE YOU CHOOSE TO GO TO DRAMA SCHOOL AT THE ROYAL SCOTTISH ACADEMY? ELLIS: I WAS LIMITED IN MY OPTIONS. I COULDN'T REALLY AFFORD TO BE A STUDENT IN LONDON. I HAD A FRIEND UP AT GLASGOW UNIVERSITY AND I WENT UP TO VISIT HIM AND JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH THE CITY. I THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING. BROWN: WAS YOUR PROGRAM MOSTLY THEATER BASED? ELLIS: YES, ALMOST COMPLETELY. THE WEIRD THING ABOUT DRAMA SCHOOL IS THAT YOU TRAIN FOR THREE YEARS FOR ONE THING AND THEN MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T TRAINED FOR THAT YOU END UP DOING. BROWN: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST JOB? ELLIS: MY FIRST PROFESSIONAL JOB WAS WHILE I WAS STILL AT DRAMA SCHOOL. MY BEST FRIEND IN MY YEAR WAS JAMES MCAVOY, AND JAMES AND I WERE GIVEN A TERM OFF TO GO AND DO A PANTOMIME IN SCOTLAND, WHICH WAS PART OF OUR CURRICULUM AT THE TIME. WE NEEDED TO DO A PANTOMIME AT THE SCHOOL, OR IF WE BOOKED A PROFESSIONAL GIG, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GO AND DO IT. SO WE WENT TO A PLACE CALLED KIRKCALDY AND DID BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. I WAS THE BEAST AND THE PRINCE. BROWN: WHO WAS JAMES? ELLIS: IN PANTOMIME THERE'S SORT OF THESE TOKEN CHARACTERS IN EACH SCRIPT. HE WAS THE YOUNG, SILLY CHARACTERSORT OF LIKE BUTTONS IN CINDERELLA. [ LAUGHS ] BROWN: IT'S NICE THAT YOU WERE ALLOWED TO GO OFF AND DO PROFESSIONAL GIGS. I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF DRAMA SCHOOLS DON'T WANT YOU TO DO ANYTHING PROFESSIONAL UNTIL YOU GRADUATE. ELLIS: I THINK WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE WITH OUR PRINCIPAL AT THE TIME. HE WAS VERY FORWARD-THINKING. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO GET YOUR STUDENTS OUT WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY. I ENDED UP LEAVING A TERM EARLY BECAUSE I GOT ANOTHER JOB. IT WAS QUITE A FLUID TRANSITION INTO WORKING, WHICH WAS MORE THAN I HOPED FOR. WHEN YOU'RE A DRAMA STUDENT, I THINK THE MOST YOU HOPE FOR IS TO MAKE A LIVING OUT OF ACTING. BROWN: WERE THEY QUITE ENCOURAGING AT SCHOOL? I SPOKE TO SAM HEUGHAN, WHO ALSO WENT TO RSA, AND HE SAID THAT ONE OF HIS PROFESSORS TOLD HIM HE COULDN'T ACT. ELLIS: I KNEW SAM AT DRAMA SCHOOL A LITTLE BIT. I'VE HAD THESE SORT OF CHATS WITH HIM BEFORE. MY EXPERIENCE WASN'T THAT. I FELT VERY ENCOURAGED, CERTAINLY BY A FEW KEY MEMBERS OF STAFF THERE. BUT I ALSO HAD PEOPLE WHOSE CONFIDENCE WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED AND TAKEN. IT'S A VERY VULNERABLE TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU GO TO DO SOMETHING LIFE THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF FRAGILE CONFIDENCE THERE. I KNOW SAM HAD A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE THAN I DID, BUT ULTIMATELY I WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH MY THREE YEARS THERE. BROWN: ONE OF YOUR FIRST FILMS WAS BUFFALO SOLDIERS WITH JOAQUIN PHOENIX, ANNA PAQUIN, AND ED HARRIS. YOU MUST HAVE BEEN 22. WHAT WAS THAT LIKE? ELLIS: IT WAS A VERY CHASTENING EXPERIENCE. I WENT OUT TO GERMANY TO DO IT. IT WAS A SMALL PART IN A BIG MOVIE, BUT I WAS THERE FOR SIX WEEKS. IT WAS GREAT TO BE A PART OF IT AND WORK WITH JOAQUIN, WHO WAS REALLY LOVELY AND VERY WELCOMING TO THE REST OF HIS CAST. WE HUNG OUT A BIT. THEN WHEN I WATCHED THE MOVIE MY THREE OR FOUR LINES IN IT HAD BEEN DUBBED BY ANOTHER ACTOR. I WAS LIKE, "OH. THAT'S INTERESTING. OKAY." THEY WEREN'T VERY CONFIDENT IN MY AMERICAN ACCENT, WHICH I WASN'T EITHER. IT WAS A LEARNING CURVE. BROWN: DID THEY TELL YOU AHEAD OF TIME? ELLIS: I REMEMBER ON THE SET, THE DIRECTOR WAS STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH MY ACCENT, AND I LOST MY CONFIDENCE A BIT. THEN I WENT TO WATCH IT UNINFORMED: "I'VE GOT A DIFFERENT VOICE..." BROWN: YOU'RE LIKE PHOEBE IN FRIENDS WHEN SHE WAS DUBBED OVER FOR THE "SMELLY CAT" VIDEO. ELLIS: EXACTLY. IT'S MY "SMELLY CAT" EXPERIENCE. LUCIFER WILL AIR ON FOX IN 2016.

310	"WE MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TRACK DOWN THE SOURCE OF THIS FISH KILL, BECAUSE IT LIKELY OCCURRED SEVERAL DAYS AGO." -- IOWA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES SUPERVISORS KEN HESSENIUS INVESTIGATORS FEAR THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOURCE EVERLY -- THE IOWA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IS INVESTIGATING A FISH KILL RUNNING ABOUT 20 MILES ALONG STONEY CREEK NORTHWEST OF SPENCER. THE FISH KILL WAS REPORTED NORTH OF EVERLY MONDAY MORNING, BUT RESIDENTS IN THE AREA SAID THEY'D BEEN SEEING DEAD FISH OVER THE WEEKEND. TWO CREWS FROM THE SPENCER FIELD OFFICE FOUND HEAVY CONCENTRATIONS OF DEAD FISH WEST OF FOSTORIA, THEN TRACED DEAD FISH NORTHWEST TO THE OSCEOLA-DICKINSON COUNTY LINE, APPROXIMATELY 11 MILES WEST OF MILFORD. SO FAR, DNR STAFF HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THE POLLUTANT SOURCE, BUT BELIEVE IT IS FROM FERTILIZER OR ANIMAL MANURE BECAUSE OF ELEVATED AMMONIA LEVELS FOUND JUST WEST OF SPENCER. "WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CALLS INTO THE FIELD OFFICE, MOSTLY FROM PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT WATERING THEIR CATTLE FROM THE CREEK," KEN HESSENIUS, SUPERVISOR OF THE DNR SPENCER FIELD OFFICE, SAID. "WE MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TRACK DOWN THE SOURCE OF THIS FISH KILL, BECAUSE IT LIKELY OCCURRED SEVERAL DAYS AGO," HE ADDED. "IF PEOPLE WOULD REMEMBER TO CALL THE FIELD OFFICES OR THE 24-HOUR SPILL LINE AS SOON AS THEY SEE SOMETHING THAT WOULD INCREASE OUR CHANCE OF FINDING THE POLLUTANT SOURCE." THE DNR SPILL NUMBER IS 515-725-8296. DEAD FISH ARE MAINLY MINNOWS AND CHUBS, BUT INCLUDE SOME LARGER FISH. HESSENIUS SAID THE POLLUTANT SLUG HAS LIKELY MOVED INTO THE OCHEYEDAN RIVER, BECOME DILUTED AND PASSED THROUGH SPENCER BY NOW. THE DNR WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR THE SOURCE OF THE POLLUTANT. IN ANOTHER INVESTIGATION, THE SPENCER FIELD OFFICE LOOKED FOR THE SOURCE OF A SECOND, BUT SMALLER, FISH KILL NEAR MERIDAN IN CHEROKEE COUNTY. A FISHERMAN REPORTED HUNDREDS OF DEAD CHUBS AND MINNOWS SATURDAY MORNING. HOWEVER, TESTING RESULTS FROM BEAR CREEK ON MONDAY SHOWED RELATIVELY GOOD WATER QUALITY WITH HIGH LEVELS OF DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND LOW LEVELS OF AMMONIA. DNR SPECIALISTS WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY A POLLUTANT SOURCE, BUT SPECULATE THAT SOMETHING MAY HAVE WASHED INTO THE STREAM FOLLOWING A 1-INCH RAINFALL OVER THE WEEKEND.

313	HE ASSERTED THAT THE DECISION WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL WHICH WILL SUPPORT IT, PARTICULARLY SINCE THERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT ANY MATTER THAT WINS REGIONAL CONSENSUS SHOULD RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS AS WELL. THE SECOND MEETING WAS ATTENDED BY US ENVOY TO SUDAN AND SOUTH SUDAN DONALD BOOTH, BRITISH COUNTERPART, MATTHEW CANNELL IN ADDITION TO THE HEAD OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AT THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTRY JEAN-CHRISTOPHE BELLIARD.

DURING THE MEETING, THE SRF GROUPS STRESSED THEIR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THE UNITY OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, WHICH BESIDES THE REBEL ALLIANCE, INCLUDE THE NATIONAL UMMA PARTY (NUP), NATIONAL CONSENSUS FORCES (NCF) AND CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS. ARMAN APPEALED TO RUSSIA AND CHINA TO SUPPORT THE AFRICAN ROADMAP BECAUSE IT SETS THE FOUNDATION FOR PEACE, SECURITY AND DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH WILL ENABLE SUDAN TO ENTER INTO A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, INCLUDING RUSSIA AND CHINA. NO DEVELOPMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED AT TIMES OF WAR, HE SAID. THE MEETING WAS ADDRESSED VIA CONFERENCE CALL BY NUP LEADER AL-SADIG AL-MAHDI, NCF CHAIRMAN, FAROUK ABU ISSA, AMIN MAKKI MADANI, HEAD OF THE ALLIANCE OF THE SUDANESE CIVIL SOCJIETY ORGANISATIONS AND GAHZI SALAH AL-DIN ATTABANI THE LEADER OF THE REFORM NOW MOVEMENT (RNM), A SPLINTER FACTION OF THE RULING PARTY.

317	I MENTIONED IT LAST WEEK, BUT I'M OUT OF TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS IN SEATTLE AND CHICAGO (HOUSE HUNTING FOR OUR NEW PLACE AND SAYING GOODBYE TO MY CHILDHOOD HOME) AND I'VE RALLIED A FEW OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGER FRIENDS TO FILL IN FOR ME FOR THIS ENTIRE WEEK. THE FIRST GUEST BLOGGER IS LAUREN, WHOSE BLOG, POST GRAD IN PROGRESS, I FOUND THROUGH A LINK UP. SHE'S SUPER SWEET AND YOU'LL LOVE HER! HELLO, HELLO, THANKS SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME JULIE! IFEEL PRETTY HONORED, HUMBLED,ANDTHRILLEDBY JULIE'S GRACIOUS INVITATION FOR ME TO GUEST BLOG WHILE SHE'S AWAY. BUT BEFORE I GET AHEAD OF MYSELF LET'S START WITH AN INTRODUCTION. HI, I'M THE POST GRAD AND I BLOG AT POST GRAD IN PROGRESS. BUT MY NAME IS LAUREN AND I'M A NEW GRADUATE NAVIGATING THROUGH THE REAL WORLD TRYING TO DIG DEEP INTO WHAT MAKES ME TICK.THE REAL WORLD FOR ME BEING, MOVING TO A NEW CITY, STARTING A NEW JOB, AND MOLDING NEW FRIENDSHIPS ALONG THE WAY. MY BLOG IS MY HAPPY PLACE. IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT LIKE MY FAVORITE ANTHROPOLOGIE HACK COASTERS, WRITE RECIPES LIKE MY DELICIOUS MEATLOAF, AND DETAIL MY TRAVELS: RUSSIA, SAN DIEGO (PART 1), SAN DIEGO (PART 2), AND MY NEW ADVENTURE OF EAT, PRAY, LOVING IT IN EUROPE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGERS, ERIKA, DOES THIS SERIES OWNING IT WHERE YOU TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR QUIRKS AND WHAT MAKES YOU, WELL, YOU. EVERY TIME I READ A NEW POST ON A NEW BLOGGER I RACK MY BRAIN OF WHAT I DO THAT IS UNIQUE TO ME. ALAS, THIS MAKES THE PERFECT GUEST POST. I BASICALLY GET ALL MY JUNK ON THE TABLE FROM THE GET-GO! THIS COULD GO ONE OF TWO WAYS...SOME PEOPLE WILL RELATE OR JUST LAUGH AT MY CRAZINESS OR SOME PEOPLE MIGHT RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BUT HEY, I'MOWNINGIT. TODAY AND EVERYDAY. HI I'M LAUREN. 22 YEARS OLD AND I STILL SLEEP WITH MY BABY "BLANKET." YES, I PUT BLANKET IN QUOTATIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY, IT ISN'T A BLANKET ANYMORE. HE IS THEREMNANTOF A FORMER BLANKET TIED TOGETHER IN A RAG. ALSO, YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT I REFER TO MY BLANKET AS "HE" BECAUSE HE JUST ALWAYS HAS BEEN. WEIRD, I KNOW. I CALL HIM "T" BECAUSE MY BABYSITTER CALLED HIM MY TRANQUILIZER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND IT STUCK. HE'S A SENSE OF COMFORT AND MAY I SAY, AWELL-TRAVELEDBLANKET. GOOD GRACIOUS, I'VE LOST HALF OF JULIE'S READERS BY THIS POINT. I'M THE CLUMSIEST PERSON YOU'LL MEET BUT I'VE NEVER BROKEN A BONE AND I'VE NEVER HAD STITCHES. PICTURE ME KNOCKING ON WOOD AT THIS MOMENT. RAW POTATOES GIVE ME THE HEEBIE JEEBIES. I LOVE THE TASTE OF POTATOES...FRENCH FRIES, BAKED POTATOES, SCALLOPED POTATOES...BUT RAW POTATOES FREAK. ME. OUT. MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY SMELL LIKE DIRT AND THEY CAN GROW ROOTS WHEN THEY SIT IN YOUR PANTRY TOO LONG. MY SKIN CRAWLS THINKING ABOUT IT. P.S. JUST POTATOES NOT SWEET POTATOES.I'M STRANGE. I CRY AT THE DROP OF THE HAT. ONEYOUTUBEVIDEO OF A SOLDIER REUNITING WITH HIS FAMILY AND I'M DUNZO. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE, I CRY LAUGHING SO EASILY. IT'S BORDERLINE EMBARRASSING BECAUSE ONCE I GET GOING I CAN'T STOP. ALSO, MY CRYING LAUGHING DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE WHERE I AM. MY COWORKERS HAVE SEEN ME CRYING LAUGHING WAY TOO MANY TIMES. WHEN I WAS IN 2ND GRADE AND MY FAMILY WENT TO JAMAICA I DECIDED IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO GET MY ENTIRE HEAD BRAIDED. I JUST GOT GLASSES, I BURN EASILY, AND I WAS GOING THROUGH AN AWKWARD STAGE SO LET'S JUST SAY THOSE PICTURES ARE ROUGH. BUT MY FRIENDS AND I GET A KICK OUT OF THEM. I THINK ILL STOP THERE. I WANT TO KEEP SOME OF MY CARDS CLOSE TO MY CHEST[SYMBOL]. BUT WEIRDNESS ASIDE, IM A GIRL WHO LOVES GOD, HER FAMILY & FRIENDS, BEING CREATIVE, AND TRAVELING. SEE WHAT CRAZY THING IM UP TO NEXT MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, AND FRIDAY OF EVERY WEEK @ POST GRAD IN PROGRESS! THANKS FOR LISTENING! HAVE A GREAT DAY, FRIENDS XOXO. THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR POST LAUREN! I ALWAYS LOVE LEARNING MORE ABOUT MY BLOGGER FRIENDS. I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOUR VERY OWN EAT, PRAY, LOVE ADVENTURE NEXT MONTH!

BACHELOR SAM WOOD AND NEW LOVE, SNEZANA MARKOSKI. PHOTO: CHANNEL TEN "IT'S GOING TO BE A LOOOONG NIGHT," HE WROTE. STUCK AT HOME ON THE COUCH WITH MAN-FLU.

WELL, LIVE-TWEET THE WHOLE THING, OF COURSE. AND SO HE DID, IN AN EPIC ONE-AND-A-HALF HOUR TWEETING SESSION, FILLED WITH BEMUSED HILARITY, FATHERLY ADVICE, THE REVELATION THAT HIS DEPUTY GLADYS BEREJIKLIAN WAS A LONGTIME FAN, AND A FEW CRUEL DIGS AT HOST OSHER GUNSBERG'S HAIR. AS THE INTERNET SAID, SNEZ MAY HAVE WON THE BACHELOR'S HEART, BUT MIKE BAIRD WON THE BACHELOR FINALE. HE SEEMS VERY SINCERE FOR A GUY WHO IS TWO-TIMING, LIVE ON TV.

319	THIS PAST MONTH, A NEW YORK TIMES REPORT ON AMAZONS PERSONNEL STRATEGIES PROMPTED SEVERAL DAYS OF INTENSE DEBATE. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS CAN BE RAISED ABOUT THE ARTICLE ITSELF, GIVEN THE FACT THAT MUCH OF IT WAS BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH THOSE WHO HAD LEFT AN ORGANIZATION THAT CLEARLY PLACED SEVERE RESTRICTIONS ON THE REPORTERS MOVEMENTS AND CONTACTS WITHIN THE COMPANY. BUT LETS ASSUME FOR THE MOMENT THAT THE ARTICLE WAS EVEN-HANDED AND ACCURATE. IT PORTRAYED AN ORGANIZATION WITH A CHURN AND BURN PERSONNEL STRATEGY OFFERING EXCITING JOBS, CREATIVE FREEDOM AMONG TALENTED CO-WORKERS, AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN HIGH COMPENSATION--BUT JOBS THAT OFTEN BECOME TOO DEMANDING FOR SOME EMPLOYEES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS OR FAMILY OBLIGATIONS. FORMER EMPLOYEES COMPLAINED ABOUT BOSSES WHO LACKED EMPATHY FOR THEIR PROBLEMS AND THAT KICKED BACK WHEN PERSONAL PRIORITIES SUPPLANTED JOB PRIORITIES. NO DATA WAS PROVIDED, BUT THE IMPRESSION LEFT BY THE ARTICLE WAS THAT BECAUSE SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE HAVE LEFT AMAZON, IT PURSUES EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY WHAT CAN BE CALLED A LOW-RETENTION STRATEGY WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE. ITS ONE THAT HAS PRODUCED REMARKABLE SERVICE FOR CUSTOMERS AND LONG-TERM PROFITS TO PATIENT INVESTORS BUT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE TO WORK THERE. (IN PARLANCE THAT MY CO-AUTHORS AND I USED IN A RECENT BOOK THAT DISCUSSES AMAZON, IT STILL FALLS SHORT OF THE SERVICE TRIFECTA.) IN FACT, IF AMAZON IS PURSUING A LOW-RETENTION HR STRATEGY, ITS CUSTOMERS PROBABLY REGARD IT AS A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF THAT IDEA. ADVOCATES OF A HIGH-RETENTION STRATEGY MAY WONDER WHY AMAZON HASNT LEARNED SOMETHING FROM ONLINE RETAILER ZAPPOS, A HIGH-RETENTION, BEST PLACE TO WORK COMPANY THAT AMAZON OWNS . SEVERAL YEARS AGO, WAYNE CASCIO COMPARED THE HIGH-RETENTION STRATEGY OF COSTCO (HIGH WAGES, HIGH PRODUCTIVITY, HIGH EMPLOYEE RETENTION, LOW EMPLOYEE REPLACEMENT COSTS, LOW PRICES, SUBSTANTIAL PROFIT) WITH THE LOW-RETENTION STRATEGY OF SAMS CLUB (LOW WAGES, LOWER PRODUCTIVITY, MUCH LOWER EMPLOYEE RETENTION, HIGH EMPLOYEE REPLACEMENT COSTS, LOW PRICES, AND SUBSTANTIAL BUT LOWER PROFIT THAN COSTCO). THE IMPLIED CONCLUSION WAS THAT HIGH RETENTION STRATEGIES LIKE COSTCOS CAN BE MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, AND INVESTORS ALIKE. (THE IRONY HERE IS THAT DAVID GLASS, WHEN HE WAS CEO OF WALMART, SAMS CLUBS PARENT, ONCE SAID: GIVE ME FEWER, BETTER-TRAINED, BETTER-PAID PEOPLE AND THEYLL WIN EVERY TIME.) BUT THINK A MINUTE. WEVE MENTIONED FOUR ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALL HAVE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL PURSUING BOTH HIGH- AND LOW-RETENTION HR STRATEGIES. IT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE HAVE PAINTED TOO ATTRACTIVE A PICTURE OF HIGH-RETENTION ORGANIZATIONS (COSTCO, ZAPPOS) IN COMPETITION WITH THOSE CHARACTERIZED BY LOW RETENTION (SAMS CLUB, AMAZON). BOTH APPARENTLY CAN PROVIDE GOOD SERVICE AND MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. IF THATS THE CASE, WHICH STRATEGY IS MOST APPROPRIATE? UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS? WHATS WRONG WITH A CONSCIOUS PURSUIT OF A LOW-RETENTION STRATEGY IF IT IS BASED ON PROVIDING EXCITING, DEMANDING JOBS, EVEN IF THEY LEAD TO BURN OUT AMONG SOME EMPLOYEES? IS IT A PROBLEM OF SUSTAINABILITY? AFTER ALL, MCDONALDS AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUSTAIN COMPETITIVE SUCCESS WITH HIGH EMPLOYEE TURNOVER FOR MANY YEARS.

320	JEPKEMOI LAUNCHED AN INNOVATIVE MARKETING AND PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM IN 2009. SHE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO CLIENT NEEDS AND QUICKLY GAINED A SOLID FOOTHOLD IN THE NAIROBI, AND LATER MOMBASA, MARKET. HER TOP LINE REVENUES TRIPLED EACH YEAR BETWEEN 2010 AND 2012 AND DOUBLED AFTERWARDS UNTIL SALES TOOK A NOSEDIVE IN 2014. HALFWAY THROUGH 2015, JEPKEMOI DECIDED TO SEND OUT ONLINE SURVEYS TO HER EXISTING, FORMER AND PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS. MUCH TO HER DISMAY, QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS INDICATED A MARKET PERCEPTION THAT HER FIRMS ONCE COVETED CREATIVITY HAD DISSIPATED AND WOULD-BE CLIENTS VIEWED THE COMPANY AS DECIDEDLY NOT INNOVATIVE. PUZZLED, JEPKEMOI ATTEMPTED TO THINK THROUGH WHAT UNDERPINNED THE DISMAL FEEDBACK. INITIALLY TEMPTED TO BLAME INCREASED COMPETITION, SHE DECIDED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. THE ONLY MAJOR CHANGE IN HER BUSINESS INVOLVED HIRING OF A NEW CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER (CMO) IN FEBRUARY 2014. HOWEVER, JEPKEMOI THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY THAT THE CMO CHANGE COULD HAVE LED TO THE DEMISE OF THE FIRMS INNOVATION. SHE VIEWED THE CMO AS A GO-GETTER, ORGANISED AND MUCH IN CONTROL OF ALL EXTERNAL ASPECTS OF THE MARKETING AND PUBLIC RELATIONS BUSINESS. JEPKEMOI DECIDED TO SET UP A BREAKFAST MEETING WITH A FORMER MBA COLLEAGUE WHO ALWAYS SEEMED TO KNOW STRATEGY AND ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENT MATTERS. BETWEEN SIPS OF COFFEE, HER FRIEND EXPLAINED THE DELICATE BALANCE OF MAINTAINING CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION IN A COMPANY. SHE RECOMMENDED THAT JEPKEMOI USE AN INTERNAL SURVEY OF HER STAFF TO GAUGE THEIR CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS TOWARDS INNOVATION. THE FRIEND POINTED OUT HOW RESEARCHERS LIKE SCOTT HELM AND FREDRIK ANDERSSON EMPLOY THE INNOVATION TOOL IN SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS BUSINESSES LIKE HERS. EAGER TO DIAGNOSE ANY ISSUES AND SAVE HER FIRM, JEPKEMOI QUICKLY DOWNLOADED THE SURVEY TOOL AND OBTAINED RESPONSES FROM HER ENTIRE TEAM. AFTERWARDS, NOT ONLY DID THE RESULTS SURPRISE HER, BUT SO DID THE RESEARCH FRAMEWORKS IMPLICATIONS FOR WHAT LEADS TO AN INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE BUSINESS. JEPKEMOI, LIKE MOST EXECUTIVES, DID NOT GRASP THE ROOT INTERNAL ANTECEDENTS THAT FOSTER EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION. RESEARCH BY ROBERT DEVELLIS SHOWS THAT MANAGERS CAN PREDICT FUTURE INNOVATION SUCCESS BY THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEIR EMPLOYEES PERCEIVE THE FOLLOWING THREE CREATIVE DRIVERS: PROACTIVENESS, RISK TAKING AND INNOVATION ORIENTATION. EXECUTIVES MUST FOSTER THESE THREE CAUSES OF INNOVATION TO BENEFIT FROM GREATER CREATIVITY. FIRST, DO EMPLOYEES FEEL THAT PROACTIVENESS IS VALUED OR FROWNED UPON? MOST EXECUTIVES PREFER PROACTIVE EMPLOYEES. HOWEVER, THE RIGIDITY, JEALOUSY AND COMPETITIVE NATURE WITHIN OFFICES OFTEN OVERRULES THE EXECUTIVES DESIRE FOR A PROACTIVE WORKFORCE. SO ONE MUST EXAMINE HOW EMPLOYEES TRULY FEEL. FURTHER, THE EXECUTIVE MUST LOOK AT HIS OR HER PAST PERFORMANCE WITH REGARDS TO PROACTIVENESS. IS YOUR FIRM SELDOM OR OFTEN THE FIRST ORGANISATION TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES, ADMINISTRATIVE TECHNIQUES OR OPERATING PROCESSES? DOES YOUR COMPANY EXPLOIT OR LAG CHANGES IN THE FIELD? ALSO, DO YOU PROVIDE THE LEAD FOR SIMILAR SERVICE PROVIDERS OR YOU FOLLOW OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS? THE TOUGH INTROSPECTIVE QUESTIONS CONTINUE WHEN ASSESSING YOUR EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISATIONS TOLERANCE AND HISTORY OF RISK TAKING. IF YOU HARSHLY PUNISH ERRANT OUTCOMES DESPITE CAREFUL PRE-PLANNING, THEN YOU SQUASH RISK TAKING. EMPLOYEES WHO FEEL EXPOSED TO CASTIGATION FOR TAKING CHANCES BECOME DRASTICALLY LESS CREATIVE IN THEIR WORKPLACE. ADDITIONALLY, DOES YOUR COMPANY SPECIFICALLY CONDUCT ITSELF IN LINE WITH THE BEHAVIOURAL NORMS OF YOUR INDUSTRY OR DO YOU BREAK OUTSIDE THE BOX OF NORMAL WORKPLACE REPORTING TIMES, MANNERS OF DRESS, EMPLOYEE TEAM REPORTING OR STAFF REWARDS? DO YOU STAY IN SAFE TERRITORY BY ACQUIRING NEW PROJECTS THAT FIT WITH YOUR PUBLIC IMAGE OR ALLOW YOUR FIRM TO TAKE ON NEW PROJECTS THAT WILL ALTER ITS PUBLIC IMAGE? NEXT, DO YOUR DECISIONS MAINTAIN OR CREATE CHANGES IN STAFF STABILITY? THE ANSWER TO THESE QUESTIONS POINT TO THE AMOUNT OF ORGANISATIONAL RISK YOU TAKE. FINALLY, LOOK INTO INNOVATION ORIENTATION ITSELF. DO YOU REWARD NEW WAYS OF ACCOMPLISHING TASKS? DO YOU HOLD INTERNAL COMPETITIONS FOR THE MOST CREATIVE SOLUTIONS? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HELD AN INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY WORKSHOP FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES? ORGANISATIONALLY, DOES YOUR FIRM RETAIN A HISTORY OF STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR MAINTAIN TRIED-AND-TRUE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES? CAN YOUR FIRM BOAST A RECORD OF SOLID DEVELOPMENT OF NEW INTERNAL PROCESSES OR THE USE OF ESTABLISHED METHODS? HAVE YOU INTRODUCED MULTIPLE NEW PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND POLICIES IN THE PAST OR INTRODUCED FEW OR NONE? WERE MOST MODIFICATIONS IN INTERNAL PROCESSES, SERVICES, PRODUCTS AND POLICIES MAJOR CHANGES OR MINOR CHANGES? THESE WILL REVEAL YOUR APTITUDE FOR COMPANY-WIDE CREATIVITY. IN SUMMARY, JEPKEMOI MUST REMOVE OR COACH HER CMO TO FOSTER PROACTIVENESS, RISK TAKING AND INNOVATION ORIENTATION IN ORDER TO REAP THE PROFITABLE REWARDS THAT GREATER INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY BRINGS TO AN ORGANISATION. HOW DOES YOUR COMPANY FALL WITHIN THE ABOVE MEASURES? SHARE YOUR IDEAS ON HOW TO FOSTER THE ANTECEDENTS OF INNOVATION IN YOUR FIRM WITH OTHER BUSINESS DAILY READERS THROUGH #INNOVATIONFORUM ON TWITTER.

THE FUSE WAS LIT. LANG SPRINTED TOWARD WRIGHT, TACKLED HIM. HE EARNED A PERSONAL FOUL PENALTY A LESSER PUNISHMENT THAN WRIGHTS EJECTION BUT THE PACKERS PROVED THEIR POINT. WE ALWAYS BACK EACH OTHER UP, QUARTERBACK AARON RODGERS SAID. T.J. WAS JUST GOING OVER THERE HELPING HIS GUY OUT. I THINK THERE WAS MAYBE SOME BS ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH WHY THAT STARTED, AND HOW THAT STARTED, BUT TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. IM NOT SURPRISED WITH T.J. HE DOESNT NEED A WHOLE LOT TO GET INVOLVED IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS, BUT WE HAVE EACH OTHERS BACK. NO, LANG DOESNT NEED MUCH INCENTIVE. REMEMBER LAST YEARS NFC DIVISIONAL PLAYOFF GAME?THREE DALLAS COWBOYS CAME AT THE PACKERS RIGHT GUARD, AND HE DIDNT BACK DOWN. BUT THIS WASNT JUST ABOUT THE ENFORCER ALONG THE PACKERS OFFENSIVE LINE. AFTER A WEEK OF CLICH-LACED RESPECT, BOTH TEAMS SHARING NICETIES BEFORE THE NFC TITLE GAME REMATCH, THE BITTERNESS SPILLED OVER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER SUNDAY NIGHT. PLAYERS CAN SAY THIS WAS JUST ANOTHER WEEK 2 GAME, BUT MOST WEEK 2 GAMES DONT FEATURE A SCRUM. YOU WONT FIND MANY POSTGAME CELEBRATIONS AFTER WEEK 2 WINS, EITHER. NOT IN GREEN BAY. BUT THERE WAS THE PACKERS DEFENSE, MOBBING JAYRONE ELLIOTT AFTER HE KNOCKED THE GAME-CLINCHING FUMBLE FROM SEAHAWKS RUNNING BACK FRED JACKSONS HANDS. THERE WAS THE LAMBEAU FIELD CROWD, CRASHING DOWN THEIR APPLAUSE AS QUARTERBACK AARON RODGERS KNELT DOWN FOR THE FINAL PLAY. I THINK THE CELEBRATION WAS A LITTLE BIT OF THE FANS' ANTICIPATION AND THE FANS WAITING FOR THIS ONE, FULLBACK JOHN KUHN SAID. FOR THAT, IM HAPPY WE COULD GIVE THAT TO THEM. AUTOPLAY SHOW THUMBNAILS SHOW CAPTIONS LAST SLIDE NEXT SLIDE DEFENSIVE BACK MICAH HYDE, WHO RECOVERED JACKSONS FUMBLE, SAID SUNDAY NIGHT DIDNT FEEL LIKE A TYPICAL WEEK 2 GAME. WHATEVER THE EMOTION RELIEF, EXCITEMENT, JOY THERE WAS MORE OF IT. AT TIMES, HYDE SAID, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR THE OFFICIALS WHISTLE BECAUSE THE LAMBEAU FIELD CROWD WAS TOO LOUD. NOSE TACKLE B.J. RAJI SAID THERE WAS A DIFFERENT FEEL AROUND GREEN BAY EVEN BEFORE GAME DAY. WITH THE SEAHAWKS IN TOWN, THERE WAS ANTICIPATION, SUSPENSE. MOST WEEK 2 GAMES DONT COME WITH NINE MONTHS OF BUILDUP. JUST BEING AROUND THE CITY THIS WEEKEND, RAJI SAID, THE ENERGY WAS DIFFERENT. I DONT MEAN TO BE DISINGENUOUS. IT WAS A DIFFERENT FEELING THIS WEEK. EVERYONE WAS EXCITED FOR THIS GAME. SO WERE NOT IMMUNE TO THE FEELING, THE ENERGY. WE HAD TO JUST BLOCK OUT THE DISTRACTIONS, AND WE FELT THAT IF WE CAN PLAY AS CLOSE TO PERFECT AS WE CAN PLAY, WE LIKED OUR CHANCES. REVENGE WAS A POPULAR WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS WIN. OF COURSE, THAT WOULD BE AN EXAGGERATION. PERHAPS THE ONLY RESEMBLANCE OF A NORMAL, WEEK 2 GAME WAS ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN THE STANDINGS. NOBODY PUNCHED A TICKET TO THE SUPER BOWL ON SUNDAY NIGHT, THOUGH THE PACKERS DID TAKE A THREE-GAME LEAD OVER THE SEAHAWKS FOR HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE IN THE PLAYOFFS. RICHARD RODGERS ALSO SCOFFED AT THE IDEA THE PACKERS NEEDED A WIN TO GAIN ANY PSYCHOLOGICAL EDGE AGAINST THE SEAAHWKS. ALL THE PROOF THEY NEEDED CAME IN JANUARY, HE SAID. UNTIL THE END, THE PACKERS WERENT JUST LEADING THE NFC TITLE GAME ON THE SCOREBOARD. THEY WERE DOMINATING THE SEAHAWKS ON THE FIELD. IT DOESNT DO MUCH FOR US, RICHARD RODGERS SAID. ITS THE SECOND GAME OF THE SEASON. THEY BEAT US IN THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP. THATS A LITTLE BIT BIGGER GAME THAN THE SECOND GAME OF THE SEASON. SO WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO, AND WERE JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO NEXT WEEK. THERES THE CHALLENGE. LOOKING FORWARD TO NEXT WEEK, WHEN THE PACKERS HOST THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS BEFORE ANOTHER NATIONAL AUDIENCE ON "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL," THE PACKERS CANT AFFORD A HANGOVER. IT WOULD BE EASY TO HAVE A LETDOWN AFTER AN EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTING WIN, BUT THE CHIEFS ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO EXPLOIT ANY SLIP. THE LAST TIME THE PACKERS MET THE CHIEFS IN THE REGULAR SEASON, THEY WERE 13-0 AND SEEMINGLY INVINCIBLE. THE CHIEFS BEAT THEM INSIDE ARROWHEAD STADIUM. HERE COMES ANOTHER REMATCH, THE PACKERS SEEMINGLY INVINCIBLE AGAIN AFTER VANQUISHING THE TWO-TIME DEFENDING NFC CHAMPIONS. STILL, THE CHIEFS ARE A PLAYOFF CONTENDER, AND THEYLL BE PLENTY MOTIVATED AFTER A DEVASTATING HOME LOSS AGAINST THE DENVER BRONCOS. SO WHILE LANG COULD APPRECIATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SUNDAY NIGHTS WIN, HEALREADY WAS PREPARING HIMSELF TO MOVE ON BEFORE EXITING THE LOCKER ROOM. IT FEELS GOOD, LANG SAID. OBVIOUSLY, IT DOESNT COUNT FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN A WIN, BUT IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE SATISFYING REGULAR-SEASON WINS THAT WEVE HAD, JUST TO GET THAT MONKEY OFF OUR BACK OF NOT BEING ABLE TO BEAT THESE GUYS. IT IS WHAT IT IS. WERE GOING TO ENJOY IT FOR A COUPLE DAYS AND GET READY TO MOVE ON TO KANSAS CITY.

322	SHEPSHED DYNAMO ARE OUT OF THE FA CUP FOLLOWING A 4-1 DEFEAT AGAINST RUSHALL OLYMPIC.  DESPITE DYNAMO TAKING AN EARLY LEAD, RUSHALL, BACK ON THEIR OWN GROUND, PROVIDED A STERNER TEST AND IT IS OLYMPIC WHO WILL TRAVEL TO CORBY TOWN IN THE FA CUP 2ND QUALIFYING ROUND. SHEPSHED OPENED STRONGLY WITH PORTER CLOSE IN THE EARLY MINUTES. THEN ON THREE MINUTES IT COULD BE DEFINED AS A POSSIBLE GAME CHANGING INCIDENT.  PAUL MIRKES, STURGEON BAY, SEPT. JAKE BETTS BACK PASS WAS CLEARED BY LAURIE PEARSON BUT WAS CAUGHT BY A LATE TACKLE FROM LUKE BENBOW. AFTER A LENGTHY DELAY WHILE PEARSON RECEIVED TREATMENT, SHEPSHED RESTARTED WITH BETTS GOAL KICK FINDING PORTER WHO SHRUGGED OFF MITCHELL TOLLEY AND MOVED THE BALL INSIDE TO DUFFY. HIS THROUGH BALL FOUND REEVE TO SHOOT PAST DEAN COLEMAN TO GIVE SHEPSHED AN EARLY LEAD. THREE MINUTES LATER, PEARSON WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE AND WAS REPLACED BY ALEX DAVIES. SHEPSHED CAME CLOSE AGAIN ON FIFTEEN MINUTES, REEVE AND LANGHAM COMBINING WELL BUT DUFFYS EFFORT WAS DEFLECTED OVER. SHEPSHED WERE TAKING THE GAME TO RUSHALL AND THEIR ONLY EFFORT OF NOTE WAS ON 17 MINUTES, ALEX REID FINDING LUKE BENBOW BUT HIS SHOT WENT WIDE. DYNAMO HAD FURTHER EFFORTS THROUGH MIVELD AND PORTER GOING CLOSE. RUSHALL BEGAN TO BREAK THE GAME DOWN AND BEGAN TO EXERT THEIR HIGHER LEAGUE INFLUENCE, DAVIES SAVING FROM BENBOW ON 25 MINUTES AND AGAIN THREE MINUTES LATER.  LOSING BOTH WOULD BE EVEN MORE COMPLICATED. RUSHALL EQUALISED ON 37 MINUTES, A DIAGONAL BALL BY TOLLEY CAUGHT OUT THE SHEPSHED DEFENCE AND ROBERTS CURLED HIS RIGHT FOOT SHOT PAST DAVIES. THREE MINUTES LATER AND OLYMPIC WERE IN FRONT, THE BALL WAS FLICKED ON FROM A THROW IN AND ALEX REID HELD THE BALL UP, TURNED AND FIRED PAST DAVIES. SHEPSHED WERE UNLUCKY NOT TO LEVEL STRAIGHT FROM THE KICK OFF, REEVES EFFORT TIPPED ONTO THE POST FOR A CORNER BY COLEMAN. FOUR MINUTES INTO THE HALF RUSHALL EXTENDED THEIR LEAD, REID LATCHING ONTO A THROUGH BALL TO SLOT PAST DAVIES. RUSHALL WERE BEGINNING TO CONTROL THE GAME AND ON 56 MINUTES A SPECULATIVE LOB FROM BENBOW WAS MET WITH A FIERCE VOLLEY BY REID FOR HIS HAT TRICK. SHEPSHED DIDNT GIVE UP AND DUFFY WENT CLOSE WITH A FREE KICK AND MEADE WAS THEN DEEMED OFFSIDE. RUSHALL CONTINUED TO PRESS AND DAVIES PROVIDED A SUCCESSION OF FINE SAVES BEFORE SAM YOUNG BROUGHT DOWN MALACHITE FARQUHARSON FOR A PENALTY BUT DEBUTANTE REPLACEMENT DAVIES IN THE SHEPSHED GOAL WAS EQUAL TO REIDS SPOT KICK. RUSHALL WERE IN SEARCH OF A FIFTH WITH 12 MINUTES TO GO. FARQUHARSONS HEADER LOOKED GOAL BOUND BUT DAVIES PULLED OFF A FINE SAVE TO TIP THE BALL OVER THE TOP. ALTHOUGH THE GAME WAS OUT OF SHEPSHEDS REACH, THEY FINISHED THE GAME STRONG WITH ADAM HOHNS HEADER TIPPED OVER BY COLEMAN AND REEVES PULL BACK CLEARED. ONCE RUSHALL OLYMPIC HAD TAKEN THE LEAD, THEY USED THEIR HIGHER LEAGUE EXPERIENCE TO THEIR ADVANTAGE BUT SHEPSHED CAN TAKE A LOT FROM THE TWO GAMES. ATTENTIONS TURN BACK TO THE MIDLAND FOOTBALL LEAGUE ACTION AS THE TEAM TRAVEL TO HEREFORD ON SATURDAY. TUESDAYS LEAGUE CUP GAME AGAINST LOUGHBOROUGH UNI HAS BEEN REARRANGED AND WILL NOW TAKE PLACE AT THE DOVECOTE ON SEPTEMBER 29.
323	ENGLEWOOD, COLO. (AP) STILL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS AND A RHYTHM ON OFFENSE, PEYTON MANNING AT LEAST FOUND HIS FUNNY BONE. THE BRONCOS PUZZLED PASSER MET THE MEDIA AT HIS LOCKER TUESDAY WITH A CAREFREE SMILE AND BOUNCED BACK FROM AN ICY POST-GAME PERFORMANCE THAT FOLLOWED THE BRONCOS 19-13 VICTORY OVER BALTIMORE, ONE THAT INCLUDED NONE OF THE USUAL OFFENSIVE FIREWORKS. HOUNDED FIRST BY THE BOO-BIRDS WHEN THE BRONCOS RAN JUST ONE RED ZONE PLAY AND THEN BY REPORTERS, MANNING WAS ACERBIC AFTER STRETCHING HIS STREAK TO 21 DRIVES, INCLUDING THE PRESEASON, WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN CELEBRATION. THIS TIME, HE DELIVERED A FEW FUNNY LINES AND DEFLECTED TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS STILL-EVOLVING OFFENSE OF BLENDED CONCEPTS WITH A TOUCH OF HUMOR. ASKED ABOUT LANDING ON THE INJURY REPORT WITH A SORE BACK COURTESY OF ALL THOSE HARD HITS FROM THE RAVENS, MANNING DECIDED TO DELIVER HIS OWN EVALUATION OF THOSE ASKING ALL THE QUESTIONS. THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY GROUP, BY ANY MEANS, MANNING CRACKED. THIS ONE SURELY HAS GOUT. BUNIONS, THAT ONE. CARPEL TUNNEL OVER HERE FROM ALL THE TEXTING OF HIS SOURCES. AND THE DRIVE-TIME RADIO HOST, HES GOT LARYNGITIS FROM RIPPING ME ALL WEEK PLUS THE RASH THAT HE HAS THATS UNIDENTIFIED. BUT I NEVER HEAR YOU GUYS COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, SO IM NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. IN MANY WAYS, YOU GUYS INSPIRE ME, MANNING DEAD-PANNED. BUT, NO, I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT I WAS ON IT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. BUT I THINK LIKE A LOT OF GUYS, IT WAS A PRETTY PHYSICAL GAME ON SUNDAY. AND JUST LIKE THAT, MANNING WENT FROM BEING THE THERMOMETER TO BEING THE THERMOSTAT, SETTING THE TONE FOR THE TEAM INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THE MOOD SURROUNDING IT. I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES AROUND HERE THAT WE DID ACTUALLY WIN THE GAME AND THAT WE ARE 1-0. THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE I CANT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE HAD WE LOST THE GAME, MANNING SAID. THE OFFENSE, WHICH INCLUDES FOUR NEW LINEMEN, DID DO SOME GOOD THINGS SUNDAY, LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER AN 11-MINUTE FOURTH-QUARTER DRIVE THAT LED TO BRANDON MCMANUSS FOURTH FIELD GOAL. IM SURE OFFENSIVELY I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF GUYS THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO PLAY BETTER. I FEEL LIKE THAT THURSDAY PROBABLY COULDNT COME SOON ENOUGH, MANNING SAID. THE BRONCOS PLAY AT KANSAS CITY (1-0), WHERE A VICTORY WOULD GIVE MANNING AND THE BRONCOS A RECORD 13TH CONSECUTIVE DIVISIONAL ROAD WIN. FIRST THINGS FIRST. FINDING THE END ZONE IS PRIORITY NO. 1 FOR A TEAM THAT JUST TWO YEARS AGO BECAME THE FIRST IN NFL HISTORY TO CRACK THE 600-POINT BARRIER WHEN MANNING THREW FOR A RECORD 55 TOUCHDOWNS. SOMETIMES THE BEST MEDICINE IS TO GET BACK OUT THERE AND PLAY AS SOON AS YOU CAN, MANNING SAID. AND, AS HE SHOWED TUESDAY, SOMETIMES LAUGHTERS THE BEST TONIC, TOO. NOTES: ILB BRANDON MARSHALL SAID ONE OF THE SCREWS IN HIS SURGICALLY REPAIRED RIGHT FOOT HAS BROKEN, BUT HELL TRY TO DEAL WITH THE DISCOMFORT UNTIL AFTER THE SEASON BECAUSE SURGERY TO REMOVE IT WOULD REQUIRE A TWO-MONTH RECOVERY. S DARIAN STEWART (GROIN) GOT HURT ON THE PLAY BEFORE HIS GAME-WINNING INTERCEPTION SUNDAY, SOMETHING COACH GARY KUBIAK DIDNT LEARN UNTIL WATCHING CB AQIB TALIB, WHO WAS MICD UP FOR THE GAME, ON THE TEAMS WEBSITE.

325	THE GARDINER EAST FOLLIES RETURNS FOR YET ANOTHER EXTENDED RUN AT CITY HALL BEGINNING ON TUESDAY MORNING, WHEN CITY OFFICIALS PRESENT THREE SCENARIOS FOR RELOCATING THE HIGHWAYS EASTERN END TO FREE UP VALUABLE WATERFRONT LAND. FOR MUCH OF THIS YEAR, AND SOME OF 2014, THE LIONS SHARE OF PUBLIC, POLICY AND POLITICAL ATTENTION HAS FOCUSED INTENSIVELY ON THE STRETCH BETWEEN CHERRY STREET AND THE DON RIVER . (FOR MORE ON THE ORIGINS OF THE PROBLEMATIC LOOP, READ THIS .) FIRST GULF, WHICH WANTS TO TRANSFORM THE SPRAWLING LEVER BROTHERS SITE INTO TORONTOS CANARY WHARF, HAS A STRONG INTEREST IN THE ALIGNMENT OF THE GARDINER/DVP INTERCHANGE, AS DO THE DEVELOPERS WHO OWN LAND ALONG THE KEATING CHANNEL. IN A SHOW LAST SPRING, SUBURBAN COUNCILLORS PUSHED TO KEEP THE HIGHWAY NETWORK IN TACT, WHILE DOWNTOWNERS FOUGHT TO REPLACE THAT ONE PORTION WITH AN AT-GRADE BOULEVARD. AFTER COUNCIL BACKED THE HYBRID OPTION, STAFF SPENT THE SUMMER CONSULTING WITH WATERFRONT ACTIVISTS, DEVELOPERS AND ENGINEERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PULL THE GARDINER NORTH TOWARDS THE RAILWAY YARD WHILE RE-CONCEPTUALIZING THE INTERCHANGE AS A SET OF RAMPS BETWEEN TWO HIGHWAYS INSTEAD OF A SINGLE CONTINUOUS ROUTE. THE ARM-WAVING ABOUT THE INTERCHANGE, HOWEVER, HAS MEANT THAT ALMOST NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT NASTY SEGMENT OF THE GARDINER THAT RUNS ASTRIDE LAKESHORE BLVD EAST, BETWEEN JARVIS AND CHERRY. INDEED, THE LATEST CITY STAFF REPORT NOTES THAT THE SECTION WEST OF CHERRY WILL LARGELY BE MAINTAINED. AND THEREIN LIES A MASSIVE MISSED OPPORTUNITY, ACCORDING TO ARCHITECT AND PLANNER CALVIN BROOK. HIS FIRM, BROOK MCILROY , HAS PITCHED CITY STAFF ON AN AMBITIOUS SCHEME TO STACK THAT STRETCH OF THE GARDINER ABOVE AN EXPANDED RAIL CORRIDOR AS A MEANS OF CREATING A KILOMETRE-LONG ELEVATED LINEAR PARK, 3.3 HECTARES OF NEW DEVELOPABLE CITY LAND AND A FRESH LEASE ON LIFE FOR LAKESHORE BLVD EAST. THE PLAN [ DOWNLOAD IT FROM DROPBOX ] WILL BE PRESENTED BRIEFLY DURING TOMORROWS COMMITTEE MEETING; CITY OFFICIALS ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED THAT THEYVE COMMISSIONED A COST-BENEFIT EVALUATION. BROOK MCILROYS CONSULTANTS, MEANWHILE, ESTIMATE THAT THE CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR THAT NEW GARDINER SEGMENT WILL BE $316 MILLION AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE OFFSET BY LAND SALES ON 4.3 MILLION SQ.-FT OF FREED-UP SPACE. BROOK, WHO HAS BEEN PONDERING HOW TO UNSTACK THE GARDINER AND THE LAKESHORE FOR MANY YEARS, EXPLAINED HIS PROPOSAL TO SPACING LAST WEEK. METROLINX, HE SAYS, PLANS TO EXPAND ITS GO SERVICE FROM 400 TRAINS PER DAY TO OVER 1,000 AS THE AGENCY MOVES TO AN ELECTRIFIED REGIONAL RAIL OFFERING OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS. THAT MEANS ADDING TRACKS THROUGH THE UNION STATION CORRIDOR, AND THEREFORE WIDENING THE RAILWAY BERM THAT HAS LONG BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE WATERFRONTS POOR ACCESSIBILITY. THE CITY OWNS A LONG FINGER OF LAND SOUTH OF THE TRACKS BETWEEN JARVIS AND CHERRY, AS WELL AS THE LAND BENEATH THE GARDINER AND THE LAKESHORE; THE THREE SLICES ARE ALMOST 70 METRES ACROSS IN SOME PLACES. IF THE CITY AND METROLINX CAN ALIGN THEIR CONSTRUCTION AGENDAS, BROOK SAYS, THEY COULD EXPAND THE EXISTING BERM SOUTH TO CREATE NOT ONLY ADDITIONAL TRACK SPACE, BUT A DECK ABOVE THE NEW TRACKS, UPON WHICH THE FOUR-LANE GARDINER COULD RUN. THE HIGHWAY PORTION, IN TURN, COULD ALSO BE DECKED, CREATING A LINEAR PARK OVERHEAD. THE PREMISE OF THIS IS VERY SIMPLE, HE STATES. ITS TO TAKE TWO INTERRUPTIONS IN THE FABRIC OF THE CITY AND TURN THEM INTO ONE. BROOKS POINTS TO SEVERAL COMPELLING ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF RE-BUILDING THE EASTERN GARDINER IN THIS WAY: STAGING : THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BERM, THE RAIL LINES, THE DECKING, THE HIGHWAY AND THE GREEN ROOF COULD ALL BE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT MAKING ANY ALTERATIONS TO THE EXISTING GARDINER. THAT TRANSLATES INTO NO CONSTRUCTION DELAYS AND ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO STAGING, WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DRIVE UP CAPITAL OUTLAYS. WHEN THE NEW GARDINER IS FINISHED, TRAFFIC CAN BE RE-ROUTED ONTO IT, AND THE DEMOLITION OF THE OLD ONE CAN COMMENCE. UNLOCKING CITY-OWNED LAND . BY STACKING THE GARDINER ON TOP OF THOSE NEW RAIL LINES, THE CITY FREES UP A STRETCH OF LAND THATS ABOUT 40 METRES DEEP AND ALMOST A KILOMETRE LONG MORE THAN ENOUGH SPACE, BROOK SAYS, TO DEVELOP POINT TOWERS, MID-RISE BUILDINGS AND OTHER STRUCTURES ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF LAKESHORE BLVD. EAST PUBLIC SPACE IMPROVEMENTS . WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT NOW POSSIBLE ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF LAKESHORE, THAT STREET GAINS A SECOND LEASE ON LIFE, AND CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO AN URBAN AVENUE RATHER THAN A SURFACE HIGHWAY. LIKEWISE, THE LINEAR PARK BUILT ABOVE THE DECKED GARDINER WILL SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF THOSE BUILDINGS DEVELOPED NORTH OF LAKESHORE, AS WELL AS OTHER WATERFRONT VISITORS AND INHABITANTS. IT ALSO PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE MID-BLOCK CONNECTIONS AND EVEN WIDER LAND BRIDGES ACROSS THE TRACKS THAT WOULD LINK THE EAST BAYFRONT COMMUNITY TO ST. LAWRENCE. BROOK POINTS OUT THAT THE LINEAR PARK WILL BE ROUGHLY AT THE SAME VERTICAL ELEVATION AS THE DECK OF THE CURRENT GARDINER, SO THIS EXTENDED STRUCTURE WONT SERVE AS YET ANOTHER VISUAL BARRIER. WHATS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT ITS VERY POROUS IN A NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION, HE SAYS, WITH EASY PEDESTRIAN/CYCLIST ACCESS BETWEEN LAKESHORE, THE LINEAR PARK AND GATEWAY POINTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CORRIDOR. HE ALSO OBSERVES THAT BROOKFIELD, THE CANADIAN COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT GIANT, HAS DEPLOYED NEW DECKING TECHNOLOGY AT ITS SPRAWLING HUDSON YARDS PROJECT IN MID-TOWN MANHATTAN, ALLOWING AN ACTIVE COMMUTER RAIL YARD TO CONTINUE FUNCTIONING WHILE A MASSIVE INTENSIFICATION PROJECT IS CONSTRUCTED DIRECTLY ABOVE IT. THE IDEA REQUIRES BOTH POLITICAL WILL, BUT ALSO A LEAP OF FAITH NOT BECAUSE IT IS TECHNICALLY COMPLEX OR FINANCIALLY OUTRAGEOUS, BUT RATHER DUE TO THE FACT THAT TORONTO, WITH ITS INCREMENTALIST POLITICAL CULTURE, HAS LONG TENDED TO SHUN BIG MOVES. YET THE RAILWAY BERM, CONSTRUCTED BACK IN THE 1920S TO MODERNIZE ACCESS TO AN INDUSTRIALIZING WATERFRONT, WAS A BIG MOVE, AS WAS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE GARDINER IN THE MID-1950S. BIG MOVES, ONE COULD ARGUE, MUST BE MET WITH OTHER BIG MOVES. AND THATS WHAT BROOK WILL BE PROPOSING TOMORROW. WITH THE GARDINER EAST EA DUE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE PROVINCE BY NEXT SPRING, MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL POLITICIANS SHOULD LISTEN TO BROOK BECAUSE HIS IDEA IS NOT ONLY PLAUSIBLE; IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE TRANSFORMATIONAL IN A HIGHLY CHALLENGED GEOGRAPHY THAT REQUIRES US, FINALLY, TO MAKE NO (MORE) LITTLE PLANS .

PETER ANDRE AND JANETTE MANRARA (BBC PICTURES) THE AUDIENCE ROSE AS ONE AT THE END AND THE JUDGES WERE FULL OF PRAISE AS THEY AWARDED 30 POINTS. OI, OI SAVELOY! THE BEST DANCE OF THE TWO NIGHTS, CRIED HEAD JUDGE LEN GOODMAN. AHHHH! SO INCREDIBLY PROUD OF @MRPETERANDRE TONIGHT! TOP OF THE LEADER BOARD & BEST DANCE OF THE NIGHTS! JUST AMAZING! WOW! OVER THE MOON! JANETTE MANRARA (@JMANRARA) SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 FANTASTIC. I LOVE THE PERFORMANCE LEVEL. GET SOME FIRE IN THE LOINS. COME ON, SNAKE HIPS! EXCLAIMED BRUNO TONIOLI. THERE WAS EVEN PRAISE FROM NORMALLY CURMUDGEONLY JUDGE CRAIG REVEL HORWOOD: I REALLY, REALLY ENJOYED IT. IT WAS SHARP, IT WAS CLEAN, YOU ROMPED IT! JEREMY VINE AND KAREN CLIFTON (BBC PICTURES) ELSEWHERE, BROADCASTER JEREMY VINE HAD THE AUDIENCE ON THEIR FEET AND JUDGE DARCEY BUSSELL IN GIGGLES AS HE AND PARTNER KAREN CLIFTON DANCED A RIP-ROARING CHA CHA CHA TO SEPTEMBER BY EARTH, WIND AND FIRE. PROMOTED STORIES TRADING ON HIS PROFESSION, THE 50-YEAR-OLDS ROUTINE BEGAN WITH A BIZARRE NEWS-THEMED SPEECH BEFORE HE HIT THE DANCE FLOOR. @THEJEREMYVINE U ROCKED THE DANCE FLOOR AND UR HIPS WERE ABSOLUTELY OUT OF CONTROL!! VERY PROUD!! ROLL ON WEEK #2. #STRICTLY10 FROM ME! KAREN CLIFTON (@KAREN_HAUER) SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 WHAT JEREMYS CHA CHA CHA LACKED IN TECHNIQUE, IT MADE UP FOR WITH SHEER ENTHUSIASM. BUT THE RESPONSE FROM THE PANEL WAS MIXED: THAT DANCE WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF DAD DANCING, SNIFFED JUDGE CRAIG. A LAUGHING DARCEY SAID: IT WAS STRANGELY FABULOUS. I KNEW I WAS GOING TO LOVE YOU WHILE LEN OBSERVED: YOU WERE NEVER SURE WHERE YOU WERE GOING NEXT! THE BROADCASTER ENDED THE NIGHT WITH A SCORE OF 20, WITH JUDGE CRAIG BESTOWING JUST TWO POINTS. KATIE DERHAM AND ANTON DU BEKE (BBC PICTURES) GLAMOUR ARRIVED IN THE FORM OF BROADCASTER KATIE DERHAM WHO CLEARLY HAD A BALL DANCING A JIVE WITH PARTNER ANTON DU BEKE. THERE WERE A FEW JOKES FROM THE PANEL AT ANTONS EXPENSE BECAUSE HIS CELEBRITY PARTNERS HAVE TENDED TO BE NO-HOPERS IN RECENT YEARS. [EMBEDDED CONTENT] ANTON, YOURE DANCING, DARLING. WERE LOVING THAT! SAID JUDGE CRAIG. THE MOST SOPHISTICATED AND STYLISH JIVE WEVE HAD, HE ADDED. HEAD JUDGE LEN EXCLAIMED: ANTON, THIS COULD BE THE YEAR YOU REALISE STRICTLY GOES RIGHT UP UNTIL CHRISTMAS! THE BROADCASTERS JIVE RECEIVED UNANIMOUS PRAISE (AS DID HER LONG LEGS) AND SHE EARNED 26 POINTS. JAMELIA AND TRISTAN MACMANUS (BBC PICTURES) NERVES WERE A FEATURE ON THIS NIGHT AS SEVERAL COUPLES SUCCUMBED, INCLUDING SINGER-TURNED-PRESENTER JAMELIA. HER WALTZ WITH PARTNER TRISTAN MACMANUS STARTED WELL, BUT THE 34-YEAR-OLD COULD NOT MAINTAIN THAT LEVEL. AT THE BEGINNING IT WAS FAB, BUT YOU START TO LOSE IT AS YOU GO FURTHER AND FURTHER, SAID FORMER BALLERINA DARCEY AS JAMELIA SCORED 21 POINTS. IWAN THOMAS AND OLA JORDAN (BBC PICTURES) EX-ATHLETE IWAN THOMAS AND STRICTLY FAVOURITE OLA JORDAN DID NOT QUITE MAKE THE GRADE WITH THEIR TANGO. THE POSTURE IS NOT RIGHT AT THE MOMENT. THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT MORE PRESENTATION, STATED JUDGE CRAIG. THE 41-YEAR-OLD LOOKED DISAPPOINTED AS HE RECEIVED ONLY 17 POINTS, BUT HE VOWED TO DO BETTER NEXT WEEK. JAY MCGUINESS AND ALIONA VILANI (BBC PICTURES) THE CHA CHA CHA ALSO BROUGHT OUT THE HIP SWIVELS FROM POP STAR JAY MCGUINESS. HE IMPRESSED WITH HIS ROUTINE ALONGSIDE PARTNER ALIONA VILANI AND EARNED 27 POINTS. THE WANTED SINGER KICKED OFF THE SHOW AND DESPITE HIS NERVES, HE IMPRESSED THE JUDGES: YOU WERE LIKE A GLASS OF GUINNESS: FULL-BODIED AND GOT A LOT OF FROTH ON THE TOP, SAID HEAD JUDGE LEN. [EMBEDDED CONTENT] BRUNO GUSHED HIS APPROVAL: YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF BEING A GREAT HIT. YOU WORKED THROUGH THE LEG, THROUGH THE FOOT, AND WE NEVER SEE THAT. WHEN JUDGE CRAIG AGREED, THE ITALIAN SPARKED LAUGHTER FROM THE AUDIENCE BY PLAYFULLY FALLING OFF HIS CHAIR. KIRSTY GALLACHER AND BRENDAN COLE (BBC PICTURES) IF TV PRESENTER KIRSTY GALLACHER WANTS TO WIN, SHE WILL HAVE TO FIND SOME CONFIDENCE. THE 39-YEAR-OLD WAS NOTICEABLY NERVOUS AND IT SHOWED IN HER PERFORMANCE WITH PARTNER BRENDAN COLE. HOWEVER, THE JUDGES DID NOT HOLD BACK AND AWARDED ONLY 20 POINTS. THE FLOW OF STEPS WERE VERY STILTED. IT LACKED A CONTINUOUS FLOW THAT THIS DANCE ABSOLUTELY NEEDS, SAID CRAIG. AINSLEY HARRIOTT AND NATALIE LOWE (BBC PICTURES) AMONG THE STARRY COUPLES, THE AUDIENCE HAD THEIR FAVOURITES AND CELEBRITY CHEF AINSLEY HARRIOTT WAS ONE OF THEM. THE 58-YEAR-OLD SHOWED DRAMATIC FLAIR DURING HIS TANGO WITH PARTNER NATALIE LOWE TO ABBAS VOULEZ VOUS. THATS THE LONGEST IVE EVER SEEN YOU NOT SMILE! SAID THE HEAD JUDGE. YOU NEED TO SORT YOUR POSTURE OUT. BUT THE ACTING, I HAVE TO SAY, WAS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT, CONCEDED JUDGE CRAIG. [EMBEDDED CONTENT] ONCE AGAIN, DARCEY APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT DISTRACTED. I COULDNT TAKE MY EYES OFF YOUR LIPS, SHE SAID AS THE GENIAL CHEF RECEIVED 20 POINTS. GEORGIA MAY FOOTE AND GIOVANNI PERNICE (BBC PICTURES) FORMER CORONATION STREET ACTRESS GEORGIA MAY FOOTE AND NEW PROFESSIONAL GIOVANNI PERNICE DANCED AN ENERGETIC JIVE AND SCORED 27 POINTS FOR THE EFFORT. THE 21-YEAR-OLD FLAGGED TOWARDS THE END, BUT THE JUDGES LIKED WHAT THEY SAW. INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE FIRST DANCE, SAID DARCEY. SO, MY EARLY MONEY IS ON GEORGIA. #STRICTLY KAY BURLEY (@KAYBURLEY) SEPTEMBER 26, 2015 JUDGE BRUNO ADDED: YOU TWO ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER, THE CHEMISTRY WAS TANGIBLE. HOSTS TESS DALY AND CLAUDIA WINKLEMAN WERE ON TOP FORM AS THEY KEPT THE NIGHT FLOWING, GEED UP THE AUDIENCE AND ENCOURAGED ANY DOWNCAST STARS.

327	BY DELLA MONROE IF YOU HAVE YOUR EYES SET ON A PUREBRED PET, PREPARE YOURSELF TO EVALUATE A FEW BREEDERS. JUST LIKE WHEN SHOPPING FOR A NEW SHOE, THERE ARE MANY FACTORS TO CONSIDER BEFORE DECIDING WHERE TO BUY A CAT FROM. BELOW ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES TO LOOK INTO WHEN SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT SELLER OF TICA REGISTERED RAGDOLL KITTENS . SELECTING A BREEDER WHO IS BOTH REPUTABLE AND ETHICAL IS IMPORTANT EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED THE PET YOU WANT. PERHAPS, THE FIRST TASK YOU HAVE TO ACCOMPLISH IS CREATING A LIST OF PEOPLE SELLING THEM IN YOUR AREA. FRIENDS OR RELATIVES WITH KITTENS, VETERINARIANS, AND ANIMAL SOCIETIES ARE RECOMMENDED SOURCES OF INFORMATION YOU COULD USE. IN THE WORLD TODAY, YOU DO NOT WANT TO MAKE A FINAL DECISION WITHOUT RESEARCHING ON THE INTERNET. IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT OTHER BUYERS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE SUPPLIERS YOU WANT TO BUY FROM. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BLOGS AND WEBSITES WITH REVIEWS OR TESTIMONIALS THAT YOU MAY FIND HELPFUL. MOST PEOPLE WHO BUY CATS ARE LIKELY TO POST THEIR EXPERIENCES ONLINE TO HELP OTHERS MAKE BETTER CHOICES. RAISING PETS IS NOT A BUSINESS ANYONE CAN DO TO MAKE SOME EXTRA INCOME. PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING QUALITY KITTENS MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TRAINING AND EXPERTISE THE INDUSTRY DEMANDS. YOU ARE THUS ADVISED TO ASK FOR CREDENTIALS OF A SELLER BEFORE CHOOSING THEM. YOU SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE BOTH LICENSED AND DULY REGISTERED TO OPERATE THEIR BUSINESSES IN YOUR AREA. TO AVOID REGRETS, THERE ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF BREEDERS YOU SHOULD AVOID AT ALL COSTS. THESE INCLUDE THOSE WHO ARE OFFERING KITTENS FOR OVER THE INTERNET. THE FACT THAT YOU WILL NOT GET A CHANCE TO MEET THEM AT THEIR PREMISES IS ENOUGH REASON FOR WORRY. IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO VERIFY THE QUALITY OF THE PETS THEY OFFER OR ASCERTAIN THEIR HEALTH CONDITIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO VISIT ANY SUPPLIER YOU HAVE SHORTLISTED. YOU SHOULD CALL OR WRITE TO THEM TO BOOK AN APPOINTMENT. THERE ARE MANY ISSUES TO LOOK INTO DURING SUCH VISITS, AND YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE IN A HURRY. TO HELP YOU DETERMINE THE TEMPERAMENT OF THE KITTEN YOU WANT, ASK TO SEE BOTH THEIR MOTHER AND OTHER RELATIVES. IT IS ALSO A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE SUITABILITY OF THE SURROUNDINGS. SOMETIMES A BREEDER WILL TAKE TIME TO INTERVIEW YOU ON YOUR ABILITY TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF THE ANIMAL. THIS IS A GOOD SIGN AND AN INDICATION THAT THEY ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT THE CATS. ALSO, BE KEEN ON THE FIRST IMPRESSION THEY CREATE WHEN YOU MEET THEM. DURING YOUR INITIAL MEETING, SPEND TIME TO CHAT WITH THEM AND ASK THEM WELL THOUGHT QUESTIONS AND GAUGE THEIR RESPONSES. A GOOD BREEDER SHOULD BE WILLING TO TELL YOU ABOUT ANY DEFECTS TO EXPECT WITH THE CAT YOU BUY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE HONEST ABOUT SUCH CHALLENGES AND CAN TELL YOU HOW TO MANAGE THEM. REMEMBER, A KITTEN SHOULD NOT BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENT BEFORE THEY ARE AT LEAST 10 WEEKS OLD.

FINAL FIVE: HEATHER, LANA, NINA, SARAH AND SNEZANA REMAIN IN THE SHOW
329	BOSTON, MA SINCE 1963, KATHARINE DIXON DUKAKIS, BETTER KNOWN AS KITTY, FAITHFULLY STOOD BY THE SIDE OF HER HUSBAND, WHOM SHE HAD JUST MARRIED, WHO WAS JUST BEGINNING WHAT WAS TO BE A LONG AND ILLUSTRIOUS POLITICAL CAREER. HIS NAME, MICHAEL STANLEY DUKAKIS A MEMBER OF THE MASSACHUSETTS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM 1963 UNTIL 1971, GOVERNOR THE STATE FROM 1975 TO 1979 AND AGAIN FROM 1983 TO 1991, AND THE 1988 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE. ONLY THE SECOND GREEK-AMERICAN GOVERNOR IN U.S. HISTORY SPIRO AGNEW (MD) WAS THE FIRST DUKAKIS ARGUABLY HAS ECLIPSED AGNEW, WHO WAS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FROM 1969 TO 1973, AS THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE GREEK-AMERICAN POLITICIAN OF ALL TIME. THROUGHOUT MUCH OF DUKAKIS POLITICAL CAREER, KITTY SUFFERED SOMETIMES SILENTLY, SOMETIMES INEVITABLY IN THE PUBLIC EYE WITH BOUTS OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE. NOW THAT HER HUSBAND IS OUT OF OFFICE, SHE IS NOT ONLY OPEN ABOUT THOSE ABUSES WHICH BECAME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE DECADES AGO BUT ALSO ABOUT HER DEPRESSION AND THE REVOLUTIONARY MANNER THROUGH WHICH SHE TREATED IT. IN FACT, SHE AND THE FORMER GOVERNOR PUBLICLY CONVEY THE MAGNIFICENT BENEFITS OF ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY (ECT). ECT UNQUESTIONABLY SAVED HER LIFE, GOVERNOR DUKAKIS TOLD THE NATIONAL HERALD, REGARDING THE THERAPYS REMARKABLE EFFECTS ON HIS WIFES CONDITION. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH POLITICO, MASSACHUSETTS FORMER FIRST COUPLE DISCUSS THE SAGA THAT HAS LED TO THEIR SHARING A PROMISING EMERGENCE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. KITTY VOLUNTARILY CHECKED INTO MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL IN JUNE 2001 AS JANE DEE, POLITICO REPORTS, FOR TREATMENT FOR SEVERE DEPRESSION. THANKS TO ECT, SHE IMMEDIATELY FELT MUCH BETTER WELL ENOUGH, IN FACT, TO JOIN HER HUSBAND IN CELEBRATING THEIR 38 TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY THE VERY NEXT DAY. THERE WERE NEGATIVE STIGMAS ATTACHED TO ECT, PARTICULARLY MADE PREVALENT BY THE OSCAR-WINNING 1975 FILM ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST KITTY HERSELF TOLD POLITICO SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AS SHE ENTERED THE HOSPITAL FOR HER FIRST TREATMENT. BUT THE DUKAKISES SOON REALIZED THAT DESPITE PERCEPTION, ECT WAS WONDERFULLY SUCCESSFUL. ACCORDINGLY, KITTY DECIDED SHE NO LONGER WANTED TO BE ANONYMOUS. AS POLITICO DESCRIBES, THEY HAD A PLATFORM TO ADVOCATE A MEDICAL TREATMENT THAT, DESPITE ITS MASSIVE IMAGE PROBLEM, IS WIDELY CREDITED WITH SAVING LIVES AND SETTING PATIENTS ONCE CRIPPLED WITH DEPRESSION ON THE ROAD TO HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE FUTURES. IN THE PROCESS, THE DUKAKISES HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES TO BE THE UNEXPECTED CHAMPIONS OF ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL AND MISUNDERSTOOD BUT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PROCEDURES IN MODERN MEDICINE. IN FACT, KITTY IS THE ONE DRAWING THE BIGGEST CROWDS THESE DAYS, HER CELEBRITY POLITICIAN HUSBAND TELLS POLITICO. BY COMPARISON, I ONLY GET POLITE APPLAUSE ITS PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY. DIET PILLS THE ADDICTION FOR MRS. DUKAKIS STARTED IN THE 1950S, WHEN SHE BEGAN SNEAKING HER MOTHERS DIET PILLS A EUPHEMISM AT THE TIME FOR AMPHETAMINES, OR SPEED, POLITICO REPORTED. THE HABIT GREW AND IT WASNT UNTIL 1974 WHEN DUKAKIS LEARNED ABOUT IT AND ASKED HER TO STOP. SHE TRIED, BUT COULDNT SHAKE THE HABIT FOR GOOD. KITTY FINALLY ENTERED REHABILITATION AND KICKED THE HABIT EIGHT YEARS LATER. BUT ALCOHOL REPLACED THE DRUGS, POLITICO WROTE, WHICH EXPERTS SAY IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION TO USE BOTH AS SELF-MEDICATION. SHE WAS ABLE TO TEMPER HER USE OF ALCOHOL DURING DUKAKIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, BUT INTENSIFIED HER DRINKING AFTER THE ELECTION WAS OVER. ECT-EPTIONAL NOTHING SEEMED TO WORK, UNTIL ECT. AS POLITICO DESCRIBES, AN ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY TREATMENT IS SUPPOSED TO RESET THE BRAIN TO DISRUPT THE PATIENTS DEPRESSION KIND OF LIKE REBOOTING A COMPUTER. WITH THE PATIENT UNDER ANESTHESIA, A SMALL CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY IS USED TO SPARK A GRAND MAL SEIZURE. DR. CHARLES WELCH, ONE OF THE NATIONS TOP EXPERTS ON ECT AND KITTYS PSYCHIATRIST, EXPLAINS THAT THE RESULTING SEIZURE IS THE NEUROLOGICAL EQUIVALENT OF FLICKING ON AND OFF EVERY LIGHT BULB IN NEW YORK CITY THREE TIMES IN ONE SECONDA MASSIVE EVENT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO JOLT THE BRAIN BACK INTO ITS NORMAL STATE. ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF PATIENTS WHO DO A SERIES OF ECT WHICH COULD RANGE FROM SIX TO 12 TREATMENTS GIVEN OVER A SERIES OF WEEKS GO INTO REMISSION. IT HAS THE HIGHEST REMISSION RATE OF ANY OF THE TREATMENTS THAT EXIST FOR DEPRESSION, SAYS DR. SARAH LISANBY, THE CHAIR OF THE PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES DEPARTMENT AT THE DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. LIKE OTHER CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS, THAT REMISSION IS NOT OFTEN PERMANENT. PATIENTS TYPICALLY GO ON ANTI-DEPRESSANT MEDICATION AFTER TREATMENT AND HAVE FOLLOW UP ECT TREATMENTS WHEN SIGNS OF DEPRESSION RETURN. LISANBY AND OTHER PSYCHIATRISTS SAY THAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FACING ECT NOW IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT REMISSION MORE PERMANENT. KITTY HAS TRAVELED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SINGING THE PRAISES OF ECT AND NEXT YEAR PLANS TO APPEAR FOR THE SECOND TIME AT AN ECT CONFERENCE IN SCANDINAVIA, POLITICO REPORTS, WHERE THAT THERAPY IS MORE WIDELY ACCEPTED THAN IN THE UNITED STATES. I CANT IMAGINE WHAT LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE WITHOUT ECT, SHE TELLS POLITICO. IT REALLY SAVED MY LIFE. ECT IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY ACCEPTED TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION, AND, IN FACT, IS BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR SEVERE DEPRESSION THERE IS. IT IS RELATIVELY QUICK AND PAINLESS, DUKAKIS TOLD TNH. SOMETIMES JUST ONE SERIES OF FIVE OR SIX TREATMENTS TAKES CARE OF THE PROBLEM FOR THE LONG TERM. IN OTHER CASES LIKE KITTYS, SHE NOW HAS ECT MAINTENANCE ONE TREATMENT ONCE A MONTH, AND SHE TAKES NO MEDICATION, WHICH NEVER HELPED HER ANYWAY. SHE NOW CHAIRS AN ECT SUPPORT GROUP, THE GOVERNOR CONTINUED, SPEAKS AT GRAND ROUNDS AT HOSPITALS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND IS THE CO-AUTHOR OF THE BOOK, SHOCK: THE HEALING POWER OF ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY, WHICH IS WIDELY USED AND RECOMMENDED BY PSYCHIATRISTS TO THEIR PATIENTS. AWARENESS AS ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION APPROACHES, DUKAKIS, A FIRSTHAND VETERAN OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS, WOULD LIKE MENTAL HEALTH BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT. I CERTAINLY HOPE THE CANDIDATES FOR THE PRESIDENCY WILL BE TALKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE CAMPAIGN. IT IS NOT, AND SHOULD NOT, BE A POLITICAL ISSUE, DUKAKIS BELIEVES, YET ONE THAT ALL POLITICIANS SHOULD ADDRESS. THERE IS NOTHING PARTISAN ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS. NOW, WITH THE PASSAGE BY THE CONGRESS OF BOTH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MENTAL HEALTH PARITY, WHICH REQUIRES INSURERS TO COVER MENTAL HEALTH JUST THE WAY THEY COVER ALL OTHER KINDS OF HEALTH, WE COULD BE ON THE THRESHOLD OF A HUGE BREAKTHROUGH IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THIS COUNTRY. THE POST APPEARED FIRST ON THE NATIONAL HERALD .

331	AHMEDS CLOCK IN THE AGE OF GRIEVANCE-MONGERING A PHONY CASE OF ISLAMOPHOBIA BY KEVIN D. WILLIAMSON POSTED BY RUTH KING ON SEPTEMBER 18TH, 2015 HTTP://WWW.NATIONALREVIEW.COM/ARTICLE/424202/AHMED-MOHAMED-CLOCK AHMED MOHAMED IS A HUMAN RORSCHACH TEST. LOOK AT THAT FACE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE: MUSLIM-AMERICAN? AFRICAN-AMERICAN? I MYSELF SEE SOMETHING VERY FAMILIAR: NERD-AMERICAN. MOHAMED, A 14-YEAR-OLD HIGH-SCHOOL FRESHMAN IN TEXAS AND THE SON OF AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY FROM SUDAN, IS A CAUSE CLBRE JUST AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE HE WAS HANDCUFFED, FROG-MARCHED OUT OF A CLASSROOM, AND ARRESTED FOR THE CRIME OF SHOWING OFF HIS TECHNOLOGICAL CHOPS BY BUILDING AN ELECTRONIC CLOCK AND BRINGING IT TO SCHOOL TO SHOW HIS ENGINEERING TEACHER. (LET US NOW PRAISE MACARTHUR HIGH SCHOOL IN IRVING, TEXAS, FOR THE FACT THAT 14-YEAR-OLDS THERE HAVE ENGINEERING TEACHERS.) APPARENTLY, AN ENGLISH TEACHER IT HAD TO BE AN ENGLISH TEACHER THOUGHT THE DEVICE LOOKED LIKE A BOMB. IT DIDNT. BUT IT LOOKED A HELL OF A LOT MORE LIKE A BOMB THAN THAT HALF-EATEN POP-TART IN THE POSSESSION OF THAT SEVEN-YEAR-OLD IN MARYLAND LOOKED LIKE A GUN, YET THE CHILD WAS SUSPENDED; IT WAS SURELY MORE REASONABLE TO THINK THAT THOSE CIRCUIT BOARDS CONSTITUTED A BOMB THAN TO THINK THAT THE BANG-BANG! HAND GESTURE OF A TEN-YEAR-OLD IN MILFORD, MASS., CONSTITUTED A SERIOUS THREAT TO SHOOT SOMEBODY; TAKING A HIGH-SCHOOL KID INTO CUSTODY AFTER A TEACHER REPORTS A POSSIBLE BOMB THREAT IS SURELY NO MORE IRRATIONAL THAN ARRESTING AN EIGHTH-GRADER OVER AN NRA T-SHIRT. MOHAMEDS FATHER SAYS THAT HIS SON WAS MISTREATED BECAUSE THE INCIDENT HAPPENED A FEW DAYS AFTER THE ANNUAL COMMEMORATION OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TERROR ATTACKS, AND BECAUSE HIS NAME IS MOHAMED. THE STORY IMMEDIATELY BECAME UBIQUITOUS NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED BONEHEADED AS THAT WAS BUT BECAUSE IT CAN BE USED TO FURTHER A STORY THAT THE MEDIA ALREADY WANT TO TELL: THAT THE UNITED STATES IS MORALLY CORRUPT AND IRREDEEMABLY RACIST; THAT MUSLIMS ARE UNDER SIEGE; THAT WHITE PRIVILEGE BLINDS THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS TO THE CORRUPTION AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING RED, WHITE, AND BLUE. MUSLIM KID MEETS PARANOIA IN TEXAS IS A-1 COPY; NRA-WEARING KID MEETS PARANOIA IN WEST VIRGINIA, NOT SO MUCH. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, NEVER ONE TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CHEAP MORAL PREENING, INVITED MOHAMED TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THATS AN INTERESTING GESTURE: ANYBODY WANT TO HAZARD A GUESS AS TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A YOUNG MAN SHOWED UP AT THE WHITE HOUSE VISITORS CENTER WITH A BACKPACK IN WHICH WAS A HOMEMADE DEVICE FULL OF CIRCUIT BOARDS JOINED TO A TIMING DEVICE? I DO NOT FREQUENT THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT I OFTEN AM IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE OFFICE BUILDINGS IN WASHINGTON, AND MY BEST GUESS IS THAT IF ID TRIED TO BRING MOHAMEDS CLOCK INTO ONE OF THOSE PLACES, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN GUNS DRAWN. OH, BUT THOSE ARE HIGH-SECURITY ENVIRONMENTS! YOU MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO PROTEST. MOHAMED WAS ARRESTED BY HIGH-SCHOOL CAMPUS POLICE IN SUBURBIA, TEXAS. WHY ARE THERE POLICE STATIONED AT SUBURBAN HIGH SCHOOLS? BECAUSE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOW A HIGH-SECURITY ENVIRONMENT, OR AT LEAST MANY OF THEM ARE INTENDED TO BE. THAT IS TRUE NOT ONLYOF BIG CITIES, WHERE THE ARCHITECTURE OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS, NOT COINCIDENTALLY, PENAL; PUBLIC SCHOOLS FAR AND WIDE ACROSS THE FRUITED PLAIN GET THE METAL-DETECTORS-AND-MEN-WITH-GUNS TREATMENT. RELATED: #ISTANDWITHAHMED AGAINST AUTHORITARIAN IDIOCY MAYBE YOU THINK THAT IS APPROPRIATE. MAYBE IT IS. MAYBE EVERY NONCONFORMING TUBE OF OUTLAW PEPSODENT SEIZED BY TSA AGENTS IS IN REALITY A BLOW AGAINST AL-QAEDA, AND MAYBE BRIGHT-ORANGE PLASTIC SQUIRT-GUNS REALLY ARE A MENACE TO POLICE OFFICERS ROLLING THROUGH THE MALLS OF AMERICA IN ARMORED VEHICLES. BUT YOU CANNOT VERY WELL GO ACTIVELY CULTIVATING AN ATMOSPHERE OF PARANOIA AND THEN PRONOUNCE YOURSELF SURPRISED BY ALL THE PARANOIA IN THE AIR. #SHARE#THIS IS AN AGE OF OVERREACTION. IT IS, UNHAPPILY, ALSO AN AGE OF RACE-HUSTLING AND GRIEVANCE-MONGERING. THANK GOODNESS THAT FELONIOUS POP-TART IN MARYLAND WAS ONE OF THE STRAWBERRY-FLAVORED ONES WITH RAINBOW SPRINKLES AND NOT BROWN SUGAR/CINNAMON OR MARSHMALLOW HOT CHOCOLATE OR ANOTHER OF THE FLAVORS OF COLOR, OR WED BE HAVING A NATIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHITE-FROSTING PRIVILEGE. OF COURSE IT IS THE VERY SAME SELF-SATISFIED LIFESTYLE LIBERALS WHO WANT TO SEND YOUR TODDLER TO GITMO FOR PLAYING WITH A CAP GUN WHO ARE SO THEATRICALLY APPALLED AT WHAT HAPPENED TO MOHAMED. THE STRUCTURES OF PARANOIA THAT HAVE BEEN SO ASSIDUOUSLY FORTIFIED AROUND OUR SCHOOLS ARE THERE FOR A PURPOSE, AND THAT PURPOSE IS POLITICAL: TO IMMERSE YOUNG PEOPLE IN A CULTURE IN WHICH NRA LITERATURE IS SAMIZDAT BUT HOW-TO-FELLATE-YOUR-FRIENDS LITERATURE IS MANDATORY, WHERE WHITEWASHED ISLAMIC STUDIES ARE PART OF THE STANDARD CURRICULUM AND CHRISTIAN PRAYER GROUPS ARE VERBOTEN. THE PARANOIA IS INTENTIONAL, IT IS CULTIVATED WITH EXQUISITE CARE BUT IT ISNT SUPPOSED TO INFLICT COLLATERAL DAMAGE ON BESPECTACLED YOUNG MEN NAMED AHMED MOHAMED. THUS, THE PRESIDENTIAL INTERVENTION, ETC. AHMED MOHAMED WAS MISTREATED BY IMBECILES, AND HELL BE FAMOUS FOR IT, FOR 15 WARHOLIAN MINUTES, AND THEN AGAIN FOR A 30-SECOND SPOT WHEN HE GRADUATES IN A FEW YEARS AND GOES OFF TO MIT OR WHEREVER. THE FACT IS THAT HE IS NOT WORSE OFF BECAUSE HIS NAME IS MOHAMED, BUT BETTER OFF: NOBODY WOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION OTHERWISE, AND HE MIGHT VERY WELL BE IN JAIL. BEING MISTREATED BY IMBECILES IS THE SINE QUA NON OF AMERICAN PUBLIC EDUCATION TODAY, BUT THAT FACT IS OF POLITICAL USE ONLY PERIODICALLY, AS IN THIS CASE. KEVIN D. WILLIAMSON IS ROVING CORRESPONDENT AT NATIONAL REVIEW. CATEGORIZED UNDER: MAIN. TAGGED WITH: NO TAGS. COMMENTS ARE CLOSED.

THE GUNNERS PARENT COMPANY ANNOUNCED A PROFIT OF 24.7 MILLION AND A CASH RESERVE OF 193.1 MILLION IN THE SAME WEEK AS ARSENE WENGERS SIDE SLUMPED TO A DISAPPOINTING 2-1 DEFEAT IN THEIR OPENING CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TIE AWAY TO DINAMO ZAGREB. THE RESULTS, COVERING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2015, PUT THE GROUPS TOTAL TURNOVER AT 344.5 MILLION, UP FROM 301.9 MILLION IN 2014. SEE MORE: WENGER FOCUSING ON SOCCER, CHELSEA INSTEAD OF MOURINHO . ARSENAL INVESTED HEAVILY IN ARSENE WENGERS FA CUP-WINNING SQUAD OVER THE PERIOD, WITH AN OUTLAY OF AROUND 114 MILLION AND INCREASED WAGES NOW UP TO JUST OVER 192 MILLION. HOWEVER, THE GUNNERS ADDED ONLY GOALKEEPER PETR CECH, SIGNED FROM CHELSEA, TO THE SQUAD DURING THE 2015 SUMMER TRANSFER WINDOW, AND THEY DID NOT BRING IN ANOTHER STRIKER AHEAD OF THE SEPTEMBER DEADLINE DESPITE A LENGTHY INJURY TO DANNY WELBECK . ALTHOUGH ARSENALS BUMPER CASH RESERVES, WHICH EXCLUDE A 35 MILLION PAYMENT ON THE LONG-TERM EMIRATES STADIUM FINANCING, ARE INTENDED TO COVER COSTS FOR A FULL SEASON, AND ARE NOT SOLELY DESIGNATED FOR PLAYER TRANSFERS, THERE ARE GROWING CALLS FOR SOME OF THE SURPLUS FUNDS TO BE USED ON RECRUITMENT. SEE MORE: PREMIER LEAGUE CLUBS STILL FAILING EUROPES TACTICS TESTS . AISA CHAIR LOIS LANGTON TOLD PRESS ASSOCIATION SPORT: ARSENALS FINANCIAL RESULTS AT LEAST SHOW THAT THE CLUB HAS PRODUCED ONE GOOD PERFORMANCE SO FAR THIS WEEK. THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE CLUB IS WELL-RUN. WHAT SUPPORTERS WANT TO SEE, HOWEVER, IS THAT THE FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE MATCHED BY RESULTS ON THE PITCH AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE TIMING FOR ARSENAL THAT THE RESULTS HAVE FOLLOWED HOT ON THE HEELS OF A WOEFUL PERFORMANCE IN EUROPE. SPENDING MONEY IN THE TRANSFER WINDOW ISNT ALWAYS THE ANSWER; ONE QUALITY SIGNING IS OFTEN BETTER THAN SEVERAL AVERAGE SIGNINGS. HOWEVER, IN A WEEK WHERE MANY SUPPORTERS HAVE SPENT CONSIDERABLE MONEY FOLLOWING THE TEAM INTO EUROPE ONLY TO SEE A BELOW-PAR PERFORMANCE, THE FINANCIAL FIGURES WILL ONLY ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE FOR THOSE CALLING FOR FURTHER SQUAD INVESTMENT.
334	IN 2014, NATIONAL COUNCIL ON ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCE OF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, INC. (NCADD OF MIDDLESEX), INC. INITIATED QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH EFFORTS TO EXAMINE CURRENT AWARENESS AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE AGENCYS BRAND IDENTITY; POTENTIAL BARRIERS WITH THE BRAND NAME; AND, WHAT THE AGENCY NEEDED TO IMPROVE ITS BRAND IDENTITY TO ONE THAT MORE CLOSELY RESONATES WITH ITS TARGET AUDIENCES AS WELL AS CURRENT AND FUTURE EFFORTS THE AGENCY IMPLEMENTS. WE LEARNED THAT: THE NCADD NAME CREATES CONFUSION AS TO WHETHER THE ORGANIZATION IS NATIONAL OR LIMITED TO MIDDLESEX COUNTY; ONE OF NCADDS PRIMARY FUNCTIONS IS PREVENTION, WHICH IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE NAME; AND, THE NCADD LOGO IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AGENCY AND WHAT IT DOES. THE RESULT OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS IS OUR NEW NAME, THE WELLNESS CENTER FOR PREVENTION, SAID BOARD OF TRUSTEES PRESIDENT JEFF JANNARONE. NOW, ADDED JANNARONE, OUR NEW TAGLINE REPRESENTS THE AGENCYS COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING HEALTHY LIVING THROUGH EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND ADVOCACY. THE WORD WELLSPRING IT IS A REAL WORD, BUT IT PLAYS OFF WELLNESS (PREVENTION) AND SOURCE (RESOURCE AND THE SOURCE OF THE BEST INFORMATION) WE PROVIDE THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, NOTED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR EZRA HELFAND. OUR NEW NAME INVOKES A BOTTOM-UP ORGANIC APPROACH. WELLSPRING REPRESENTS THE FACT THA WE ARE NOT SOME BIG, IMPERSONAL INSTITUTION. WE COME FROM A LOCAL PLACE AND DEVELOP IDEAS, SERVICES, AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE THEN SCALABLE TO WIDER AUDIENCES, BUT ARE GROUNDED IN THE WORK WE DO IN COMMUNITIES. HELFAND SAID THAT WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES.  XAVIER WAS STUNNED BY CENTRAL LAST WEEK, 20-18. WE CHANGE PEOPLES LIVES THROUGH PREVENTION EDUCATION AND POSITIVE COMMUNITY CHANGE. SINCE 9980, NCADD/WELLSPRING HAS BEEN PROVIDING A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES THAT FEATURE: AN EVER-EXPANDING ARRAY OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT COURSES FOR ADDICTION COUNSELORS, PREVENTION SPECIALISTS, SCHOOL FACULTY, AND SCHOOL STAFF. EDUCATIONAL SERVICES (TO SCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITY) AND SUPPORT TO THOSE WHO NEED ASSISTANCE CONFRONTING THE DISEASE OF ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCE IN THE FORM OF INFORMATION, GUIDANCE, OR REFERRAL. SERVICES FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND THE WELLBEING OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. FAR FROM TELLING YOUTH TO JUST SAY NO, WE PLEDGE TO ONLY PROVIDE SERVICES THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE CHANGE BEHAVIOR FOR THE BETTER. EFFORTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE, ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUTH. WE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASED COLLABORATION AND PLANNING COORDINATION, AND SHARING OF RESOURCES, THEREBY MAXIMIZING THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS OF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, AND BEYOND.

WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR NEW COMPANY NAME, CONCLUDED HELFAND. WE BELIEVE THE NAME WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION ALLOWS US TO BETTER REPRESENT WHO WE ARE AND WILL ENABLE US TO OFFER AND INTRODUCE NEW SERVICES. CHANGING OUR NAME TO WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION FINALIZES AN ONGOING SHIFT IN CORPORATE STRATEGY THAT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, ADDED JANNARONE. WHILE WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN WHAT WEVE ACCOMPLISHED TO-DATE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND INNOVATE.

336	THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPPED BY NEARLY THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS BETWEEN 2013 AND 2104, ACCORDING THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, FROM 13.3 TO 10.4 PERCENT. PUT ANOTHER WAY, 8.8 MILLION MORE PEOPLE WERE INSURED IN 2014 THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. THE ANNUAL STUDY FROM CENSUS IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE MEASURE OF HEALTH INSURANCE, ALTHOUGH A CHANGE IN THE WAY HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED MAKE THIS YEAR'S REPORT COMPARABLE TO 2013 BUT NOT EARLIER YEARS. CENSUS OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT A DIFFERENT ANNUAL SURVEY THAT HAS ASKED HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THIS TO BE THE BIGGEST DROP IN THE UNINSURED SINCE AT LEAST 2008. OTHERS SAY THE SIZABLE INCREASE IN AMERICANS WITH INSURANCE DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL HEALTH LAW IS UNPRECEDENTED SINCE THE CREATION OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID 50 YEARS AGO. "IT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DROP EVER," SAID PAUL FRONSTIN, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH RESEARCH AT THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WHO HAS BEEN STUDYING THE UNINSURED SINCE 1993. MORE IMPORTANTLY, SAID DIANE ROWLAND, HEAD OF THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION'S COMMISSION ON MEDICAID AND THE UNINSURED, "THE GAINS ARE EXACTLY WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WERE," MEANING THE LARGEST INCREASES IN COVERAGE WERE IN THOSE GROUPS WITH TRADITIONALLY THE HIGHEST RATES OF UNINSURANCE YOUNGER, WORKING-AGE ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH LOW AND MODERATE INCOMES. (KAISER HEALTH NEWS IS AN EDITORIALLY INDEPENDENT PROGRAM OF THE FOUNDATION.) DESPITE THE GAINS, THE CENSUS STUDY FOUND THAT 33 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT INSURANCE. WHILE THE GAINS IN INSURANCE COVERAGE WERE WIDESPREAD, THEY WEREN'T EQUAL IN EVERY CATEGORY. NOT SURPRISINGLY, AMONG TYPES OF COVERAGE, THE BIGGEST INCREASES WERE IN PEOPLE COVERED BY MEDICAID (UP 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 62 MILLION PEOPLE) AND PEOPLE BUYING THEIR OWN HEALTH PLANS (UP 3.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 14.6 MILLION PEOPLE). EXPANDING MEDICAID AND MAKING PRIVATE INSURANCE EASIER TO PURCHASE BY THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER COVERAGE WERE KEY FOCUSES OF THE HEALTH LAW. BUT THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REMAINS EMPLOYERS. THAT NUMBER HELD STEADY AT AROUND 55 PERCENT. THE UNINSURED RATE DROPPED FOR EVERY AGE, INCOME AND ETHNIC GROUP AND IN EVERY STATE, ALTHOUGH, AGAIN, SOME GAINED MORE THAN OTHERS. THOSE AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE WERE MORE LIKELY TO GAIN INSURANCE THAN THOSE WITH MORE RESOURCES. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN $25,000 PER YEAR DROPPED 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE RATE FOR THOSE WITH INCOMES BETWEEN $25,000 AND $50,000 DROPPED 5 POINTS. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR THOSE EARNING MORE THAN $100,000 ANNUALLY DROPPED TOO, BUT BY LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT. SIMILARLY, THE UNINSURED RATE FOR THE WHITE NON-HISPANIC POPULATION (THE ETHNICITY MOST LIKELY TO HAVE INSURANCE) DROPPED BY JUST OVER 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS, WHILE THE RATES FOR BLACKS, ASIAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS DROPPED BY MORE THAN 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS EACH. AMONG STATES, MASSACHUSETTS (WHICH BEGAN REQUIRING MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE INSURANCE IN 2006) HAD THE LOWEST RATE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT COVERAGE, AT 3.3 PERCENT, WHILE TEXAS CONTINUED TO LEAD THE NATION WITH THE HIGHEST UNINSURED RATE 19.1 PERCENT. STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, HOWEVER, SAW OVERALL GAINS IN INSURANCE NOT JUST MEDICAID THAT WERE LARGER THAN THOSE THAT DIDN'T. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE WITH INCOMES ABOVE POVERTY BUT LESS THAN FOUR TIMES THAT (MOST OF WHOM AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID) STILL SAW AN OVERALL DECLINE IN UNINSURANCE OF 6.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, WHILE STATES THAT DIDN'T TAKE THAT OPTION SAW THAT RATE DROP BY ONLY 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

338	MISTAKES ARE A NORMAL PHENOMENON IN LIFE. ALL HAVE, AT ONE TIME OR THE OTHER, COMMITTED A MISTAKE. SOME ARE DUE TO IGNORANCE, WHILE OTHERS ARE DUE TO SHEER FOOLHARDINESS. GENERALLY, WE TEND TO LEARN LESSONS FROM OUR MISTAKES, WHICH IN TURN HELP TO IMPROVE UPON OUR SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS IN LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR. WHILE SOME CONTINUALLY MAKE MISTAKES AND GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE LEARNING FROM THEM, LIFE DOES NOT AFFORD OTHERS THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY. A SINGLE MISTAKE FROM SUCH PERSONS IS ENOUGH TO LEAD TO YEARS OF SUFFERING. SOMETIMES A SINGLE MISTAKE IS ENOUGH TO LEAD THEM TO ETERNAL DAMNATION. THERE IS THIS TRAGIC STORY THAT I NEVER CEASE TO TELL MY STUDENTS. IT WAS ABOUT A BLOKE CALLED ELVIS. HE CAME FROM A POOR FAMILY BUT WAS SUCH A BRILLIANT, RESPECTFUL AND HARDWORKING STUDENT. HIS AMBITION WAS TO BECOME EITHER A DOCTOR OR AN ENGINEER. HE HAD HIS BASIC EDUCATION IN ONE OF THE REMOTEST PARTS OF THE VOLTA REGION BUT MANAGED TO MAKE SIX ONES. HIS AMBITION SEEMED TO BE ON COURSE WHEN HE GAINED ADMISSION INTO ONE OF THE BEST SCIENCE SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY. HE WON MANY ACADEMIC AWARDS IN THE SCHOOL DUE TO HIS DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK. IT WAS WHILE HE WAS AWAITING HIS SECONDARY SCHOOL RESULTS THAT A SINGLE MISTAKE LED TO HIS TRAGIC END. HE HAD A COUSIN WHO WAS A BICYCLE REPAIRER. BEING A VERY HARDWORKING BLOKE, HE DECIDED TO USE HIS HOLIDAYS TO LEARN BICYCLE REPAIRS FROM THE COUSIN. THE COUSIN WAS HOWEVER A BELIEVER IN THE EFFICACY OF THE GANJA HERB, POPULARLY KNOWN AS INDIAN HEMP. ONE DAY IN HIS BID TO CONVINCE THE COUSIN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO GAIN FROM GANJA , HE FOOLISHLY ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE TO SMOKE A ROLL OF THE HERB TO DISPROVE THE BELIEF THAT IT WAS EFFICACIOUS. AND THAT WAS HIS DOOM! SOON AFTER HE FINISHED SMOKING, HIS MIND STARTED PLAYING GAMES WITH HIM AND HE STARTED ACTING IN A FUNNY WAY. THAT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE, CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT HE HAD HITHERTO NOT EVEN SMOKED A CIGARETTE. IN THAT SCHIZOPHRENIC STATE, HE RUSHED HOME. HE MISTOOK A BOTTLE OF ACID GIVEN TO HIM FOR SAFEKEEPING FOR A MINERAL AND GULPED THE CONTENT. THE RESULT WAS A HUGE TRAGEDY. THE CORROSIVE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE DID NOT GIVE HIM ANY CHANCE OF SURVIVAL. HE JOINED HIS ANCESTORS IN SAMANFOLAND BEFORE THEY COULD REACH A MEDICAL FACILITY. BUT THAT WAS AFTER HE HAD HAD TO ENDURE SEVERE PAIN AND SUFFERING. MY POINT IS THAT A SINGLE MISTAKE COULD LEAD TO A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT MAY LEAD TO ONES DOOM. AS THE HEADING MAY HAVE HINTED, MY FOCUS IS ON THOSE RIDING ON THE GREAT ELEPHANT. BEING A HUMAN INSTITUTION, THE OSONO MAY HAVE MADE SOME MISTAKES IN THE PAST AND LEARNT LESSONS FROM THEM. BUT TRUST ME; ITS LATEST MISTAKE IS A VERY GRAVE ONE AND COULD GRADUALLY LEAD TO ITS UNDOING. THE CHOICE OF PAUL AFOKO AND KWABENA AGYAPONG AS CHAIRMAN AND GENERAL SECRETARY RESPECTIVELY IS WHAT I REFER TO. I DID SUPPORT KWABENAS BID DURING THE PARTY CONTEST, BUT HINDSIGHT HAS MADE ME WISER. AS FOR AFOKO, I SUSPECTED HE WOULD BE A DISASTER SO I THREW MY WEIGHT BEHIND A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE. AS WE ALL KNOW, AFOKO DID WIN THE CONTEST; AND IM SAD TO SAY HE HAS SO FAR PROVED ME RIGHT. MY RELIGIOUS UPBRINGING DOES NOT PERMIT ME TO ACCUSE OTHERS OF ILL-MOTIVE WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE, SO I WOULD NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THE AGENDA 2020 OPERATION THE DUO IS BEING ACCUSED OF. BUT THEIR ACTIONS SINCE ASSUMING OFFICE HAVE LEFT NO DOUBT IN MANY MINDS THAT THEIR SELECTION WAS A GRAVE MISTAKE. THE BELLIGERENT ATTITUDE OF THE DUO TOWARDS THE OTHER PARTY OFFICIALS HAS CONTINUALLY HEIGHTENED TENSIONS AMONG THE RANK AND FILE. SOME UNILATERAL ACTIONS OF THEIRS WHICH READILY COME TO MIND ARE THE ABORTIVE DISMISSAL OF MARTIN ADJEI KORSAH AND THE CHANGING OF SECURITY GUARDS AT THE PARTYS HEADQUARTERS, WHICH LED TO ARMED ALTERCATIONS AMONG PARTY FOLKS IN FULL GLARE OF THE MEDIA. THE HEIGHTENED TENSIONS THAT LED TO THE UNFORTUNATE ACID-POURING SAGA WERE AVOIDABLE. THE I-AM-EATING-FUFU EPISODE BY KWABENA HAS DONE THE PARTY MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THE RECENT ORCHESTRATION TO TARNISH THE IMAGE OF SOME PARTY OFFICIALS IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING INTERNAL CORRUPTION HAS ALSO GIVEN RISE TO MANY QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. WHY IS THE DUO SILENT ON THE ALLEGATION OF A SECRET ECOBANK ACCOUNT, WHEN THEY KNOW TOO WELL THAT THE ACCOUNT HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR CLOSE TO SEVEN YEARS? WHY DID THEY REFUSE TO SIGN THE ECOBANK SIGNATURE FORM, ONLY TO TURNAROUND TO ISSUE PRESS STATEMENTS PURPORTING TO FIGHT CORRUPTION? AND WHAT WAS THE REAL MOTIVE FOR THE PRESS RELEASE? FOR SURE, THE SECRET ACCOUNT ALLEGATION AND THE ILL-TIMED PRESS STATEMENT HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR PURPOSE. THEY HAVE INDEED TAKEN THE SHINE OFF NANA ADDOS ARISE AND BUILD TOUR AND BROUGHT NEGATIVE STORIES ABOUT THE PARTY BACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT. DID I HEAR YOU SAY SABOTAGE? I DONT KNOW WHAT NANA ADDO IS THINKING. BUT IF I WERE HIM, I WOULD BE THINKING OF HOW TO CORRECT THE GRAVE MISTAKE THE PARTY MADE IN TAMALE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM, THIS IS ONE OF THE RARE MISTAKES THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO RECTIFY. HMM, COULD THIS BE THE MISTAKE TO LEAD THE PARTY TO ETERNAL DAMNATION? MASSA, WITH SUCH HIGH LEVELS OF INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION BEING DISPLAYED BY THE SO-CALLED RESURRECTED GOAT AND HIS CRONIES, I SHUDDER TO IMAGINE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF MISRULE UNDER SUCH CONFUSED GOATS.

340	A GREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS STUNG TO DEATH BY A SWARM OF WASPS AFTER HE ACCIDENTALLY DISTURBED A NEST NEAR HIS HOLIDAY HOME IN WALES. CLIVE SOUTHALL'S HEAD WAS SO CONSUMED BY THE MASS OF INSECTS THAT HIS HORRIFIED RELATIVES SAID THEY COULD "HARDLY SEE HIS FACE". SOUTHALL, 83, WHO WAS STUNG HUNDREDS OF TIMES, RAN TOWARDS HIS FAMILY FOR HELP BEFORE HEADING TO THE SHOWER IN A BID TO WASH THE WASPS OFF. BUT HE COLLAPSED AND HAD TO BE FLOWN TO HOSPITAL. HE DIED AT ROYAL SHREWSBURY HOSPITAL ON THE SAME DAY, FROM ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK.

"THE WASPS QUICKLY SWARMED UPON HIM AND HE RETURNED TO HIS CARAVAN TO PUT HIS HEAD UNDER THE SHOWER IN A BID TO GET RID OF THEM." HIS DAUGHTER EDWINA BRUTON, 58, WHO WAS IN THE MOBILE HOME, SAID SHE COULD HARDLY SEE HER FATHER'S FACE BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY INSECTS ON HIM. SHE SAID: "ONCE HE HAD RIDDEN HIS HEAD OF THE WASPS UNDER THE SHOWER, HE SAT DOWN AND STARTED TO DRY HIS HAIR, SAYING HE HAD BEEN STUNG A LOT OF TIMES.

341	COCONUT EXPORTER FRANKLIN BAKER CO. OF THE PHILIPPINES (FBCOP) IS INVESTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED COCONUT PROCESSING PLANT IN THE FORMER CJ-TOYOTA PRODUCTION FACILITY IN DARONG, DAVAO DEL SUR. THE PLANT WILL PROVIDE THE BIGGEST PRODUCTION CAPACITY INCREASE ACROSS ITS EXISTING PRODUCT RANGE, INCLUDING DESICCATED COCONUT, VIRGIN COCONUT OIL, AND COCONUT WATER. DURING THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE PROJECT, FRANKLIN BAKER IS PROJECTED TO ATTAIN 400 METRIC TONS IN COCONUT PRODUCTION PER DAY. IN ADDITION, THE NEW FACILITY IS DESIGNED TO EXPAND FBCOPS PRODUCT RANGE TO INCLUDE NEW PRODUCT FORMATS SUCH AS RETAIL PACKS, COCONUT FLOUR, AND COCONUT MILK AND CREAM. WHILE COCONUT CREAM IS A POPULAR HOUSEHOLD CULINARY INGREDIENT IN THE PHILIPPINES, IT IS ALSO WITNESSING SIGNIFICANT USAGE GROWTH AS AN ETHNIC FOOD INGREDIENT IN MANY GLOBAL MARKETS SUCH AS THE US, EUROPE AND OTHER PARTS OF ASIA. COCONUT MILK AND CREAM ARE IDEAL FOR USE BY LACTOSE-INTOLERANT (ANIMAL-BASED MILK) CONSUMERS AND THEY ARE RAPIDLY GROWING AS A NON-DAIRY MILK ALTERNATIVE. THE COMPANY PLANS TO COMMISSION ITS NEW MANUFACTURING FACILITY AT THE END OF THIS YEAR, WITH COCONUT MILK AND COCONUT WATER LINES BECOMING OPERATIONAL IN THE EARLY PART OF 2016, ACCORDING TO CESAR GALVEZ, FBCOP VICE PRESIDENT FOR OPERATIONS IN AN INTERVIEW AT THE PHILIPPINE COCONUT AUTHORITYS COCONUT WEEK. GALVEZ SAID THAT FBCOP HAS SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME AND RESOURCES IN THE PLANNING, DESIGN, AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT OF THE NEW FACILITY INCLUDING OPTIMIZED PROCESS FLOWS, THE IDENTIFICATION OF STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT, SKILLS TRAINING, SYSTEMS SET-UP AND DETAILED MARKET RESEARCH TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT PRODUCT CONFIGURATION IS MATCHED TO MARKET DEMANDS. IT IMPORTS MOST OF THE PROCESSING EQUIPMENT FROM EUROPE AND ASIA TO ENSURE PRODUCTS WILL MEET THE STRINGENT QUALITY AND FOOD SAFETY SPECIFICATIONS OF FRANKLIN BAKER. IT IS PARTNERING WITH LOCAL CONTRACTORS FOR THE CIVIL WORKS AND FABRICATION OF SOME EQUIPMENT-ACCESSORIES. DESICCATED COCONUT HAS BEEN THE MAIN PRODUCT OF FBCOP FOR MORE THAN 100 YEARS LEADING THE INDUSTRY WITH ITS FOOD SAFETY COMPLIANT PROCESSES AND THE MOST STRINGENT QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. DESICCATED COCONUT IS MARKETED AND SOLD AS A FOOD INGREDIENT MOSTLY TO THE USA AND EUROPE, BUT HAS VERY MINIMAL PRESENCE IN THE RETAIL MARKET. AS A HOUSEHOLD COOKING PRODUCT, DESICCATED COCONUT IS USED IN BAKING, BREADING, BREAKFAST CEREAL INGREDIENT, PASTRIES, CHOCOLATES, FILLERS, AND OTHER CULINARY USES. FBCOP ALSO EXPORTS COCONUT WATER CONCENTRATE TO BRAZIL, USA, EUROPE AND JAPAN. IN 2014, THE COMPANY STARTED PRODUCING AND EXPORTING ITS OWN VIRGIN COCONUT OIL (VCO). IN MAY THIS YEAR, THE COMPANY STARTED EXPORTING TO MARKET ORGANIC VCO AND COCONUT WATER PRODUCTS AS THE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR ORGANIC PRODUCTS INCREASED TO MATCH THE INCREASE IN CONSUMER DEMAND. FBCOP MAKES THE MOST USE OF ALL PARTS OF COCONUT TO MAXIMIZE VALUE AND ENSURE ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY OPERATIONS. ALL ITS PLANTS RUN ON BIOFUEL COCONUT SHELLS WHICH ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO SUPPLY ITS FUEL REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR BOILERS. ALIGNED WITH THE COMPANYS MISSION STATEMENT AND WITH THE NEW DIRECTIONS OF FBCOPS NEW OWNERS, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN WORKING DIRECTLY WITH SMALL FARM HOLDERS AND ORGANIZED FARMERS OR COOPERATIVES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS AND PROVIDE THE RIGHT SUPPORT IN IMPROVING THEIR LIVELIHOOD. FBCOP TARGETS TO SOURCE AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OF ITS COCONUT SUPPLY DIRECTLY FROM FARMERS AND COOPERATIVES. THE COMPANY IS HEIGHTENING ITS EFFORTS TO PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND IMPLEMENT SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PROJECTS ACROSS ITS SUPPLY CHAIN UNDER ITS SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAMS AND CERTIFICATIONS FOR THE COCONUT FARMS/SOURCES. THESE INITIATIVES HELP SUSTAIN THE COCONUT INDUSTRY IN THE PHILIPPINES WHILE MEETING THE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE/FAIR TRADE REQUIREMENTS IN THE US AND EUROPE MARKET. FRANKLIN BAKERS PLANTS ARE LOCATED IN SAN PABLO CITY, LAGUNA AND STA. CRUZ, DAVAO DEL SUR. BOTH PLANTS ARE ISO 9001, ISO 2200 FOOD SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND HACCP CERTIFIED. ITS FACILITIES ARE ALSO CERTIFIED TO BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM (BRC) GLOBAL STANDARD FOR FOOD SAFETY. BOTH PLANTS HAVE RECEIVED HALAL PLANT ACCREDITATION BY THE ISLAMIC DAWAH COUNCIL OF THE PHILIPPINES AND HAVE BEEN KOSHER CERTIFIED BY OK KOSHER CERTIFICATION. IT HAS CERTIFICATIONS FOR INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR BOTH PLANTS AND THEIR RAW MATERIAL SOURCES FROM CERES EU-USDA, CONTROL UNION EU-USDA ORGANIC CERTIFYING BODIES, SEDEX, US FDA AMONG OTHERS. MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORIES FOR BOTH PLANTS ARE ALSO ACCREDITED TO THE ISO 17025 LABORATORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BY THE PHILIPPINE ACCREDITATION BUREAU.
342	ABOUT 100 BUSINESSES FACING RELOCATION IF A FUTURE PARAMOUNT ENTERTAINMENT RESORT GOES AHEAD SAY THEY HAVE BARELY BEEN CONTACTED BY ITS DEVELOPERS AND FEAR HEAVY JOB LOSSES. PENINSULA MANAGEMENT GROUP (PMG) HAS BEEN SET UP BY COMPANIES IN NORTH KENT AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED THEME PARK, MANY OF WHICH SAY THERE ARE NO SUITABLE INDUSTRIAL SITES WHICH CAN ACCOMMODATE THEM NEARBY. THE BODY, FOUNDED IN MAY, IS CARRYING OUT AN EMPLOYMENT SURVEY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE RESORT ON THE SWANSCOMBE PENINSULA BETWEEN GRAVESEND AND DARTFORD. IT ESTIMATES ABOUT 5,000 JOBS WILL BE AFFECTED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF THE ATTRACTION GOES AHEAD. LOSSES ON THAT SCALE COULD MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE 27,000 JOBS THE PARK SAYS IT WILL CREATE IN THE FUTURE. MANY COMPANIES FEAR THEY WILL BE FORCED TO MOVE QUICKLY IF THE SO-CALLED LONDON PARAMOUNT IS APPROVED BECAUSE ITS DEVELOPERS, LONDON RESORT COMPANY HOLDINGS, WILL BE ABLE TO USE COMPULSORY PURCHASE POWERS HANDED DOWN FROM THE GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THE ATTRACTIONS BOSSES SAYS THEY HAVE MET REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GROUP AND HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE FREEHOLDERS AND LONG LEASEHOLDERS ON THE ESTATES. THE COMPANIES AFFECTED LIE ON MANOR WAY BUSINESS PARK IN SWANSCOMBE, THE NORTHFLEET INDUSTRIAL ESTATE AND THE KENT KRAFT ESTATE IN NORTHFLEET. PMG DIRECTOR DOUG HILTON SAID: IT IS UNLIKELY ANY SUITABLEEMPTY INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES OR SITES ARE AVAILABLEIN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITYTO ACCOMMODATE THIS NUMBER OF BUSINESSES UNLESS THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES START TO MAKE AN URGENT ALLOCATION WITHIN THEIR PLANS. "THIS WILL MEAN ANY APPLICATION FOR RELOCATION PREMISES WILL HAVE TO BE FAST-TRACKED AND NEW UNITS BUILT,MANY OF WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE CUSTOMISEDTO SUIT SPECIFIC NEEDS, BEFORE THE LEISURE PARK DEVELOPMENT CAN COMMENCE. PMGSMOST PRESSING CONCERNIS THE SECURITY AND CONTINUITY OF THE BUSINESSES, MOST OF WHICH ARE LONG STANDING, FAMILY-RUN ENTITIES, WHICH HAVE ALREADY HAD TO ENDURE SIMILAR TURMOIL WHEN UNION RAILWAYS RIPPED THE HEART OUT OF THESE ESTATES FOR THE HS1 LINE. "THE LOCAL AND WIDER COMMUNITIES, FROM WHICH MANY OF THE EMPLOYEES AND OWNERS MATERIALISE, WILL LOSE A HUGE RANGE OF SKILLS AND JOBS IF THESE BUSINESSES ARE DESTROYED OR FORCED TO RELOCATE OUT OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA. IF IT DESTROYS ALL THESE JOBS BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS THEN THE THEME PARK WILL SIMPLY NOT BE CREATING ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IT HAS SO FAR CLAIMED. LONDON RESORT COMPANY HOLDINGS DIRECTOR FENLON DUNPHY, ON BEHALF OF LONDON PARAMOUNT, SAID: WHILE THERE IS A LACK OF SUITABLE SUPPLY OF BUSINESS PREMISES IN THE IMMEDIATE LOCALITY, OUR AGENTS ARE UNDERTAKING A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH FOR PREMISES WITHIN GRAVESHAM, DARTFORD AND THE WIDER REGION TOWARDS MEDWAY AND MAIDSTONE. WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THIS PROCESS RUNS AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO ENSURE BUSINESSES CAN BE GIVEN THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR RELOCATION AND THEREFORE JOBS ARE TRANSFERRED RATHER THAN LOST. WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE JOB LOSSES, LONDON PARAMOUNT WILL BE A LONG-TERM PROVIDER OF UP TO 27,000 JOBS IN LOCAL BOROUGHS AS WELL AS IN THE WIDER COUNTY AND SOUTH EAST.

THE COMPLICATED POINTS SYSTEM WAS COMPILED FROM THE FIVE RACES, AND THE WINNER WILL BE ANNOUNCED AT THE GADE VALLEY AGM MEETING LATER THIS MONTH.  PROVING THAT HE KNOWINGLY USED HIS CAR IN A WAY THAT WOULD LEAD TO SOMEONE GETTING KILLED IS THE CRUX OF THE CASE ALLEN COUNTY PROSECUTORS ARE PRESENTING IN AN ATTEMPT TO PUT THE MURDER CONVICTION ON WASHINGTON. ELSEWHERE, DYLAN WENDLEKEN FROM GADE VALLEY TRI WAS IN ACTION AT THE HERTS TRIATHLON IN WELWYN ON SUNDAY. WENDLEKEN TOOK ON HIS FAVOURITE SPRINT DISTANCE RACE, WHICH INVOLVES A 750M SWIM, A 20KM BIKE RIDE AND A 5KM RUN, FINISHING IN A TOTAL TIME OF 1:19:36 AND ACHIEVING SECOND PLACE IN HIS AGE GROUP. BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY SAW HARRIER RUSS BAILEY COMPETING IN THE HARWELL HALF MARATHON IN DIDCOT, OXFORDSHIRE. BAILEY COMPLETED THE 13.1-MILE COURSE IN 2:09:05 AS PART OF HIS TRAINING FOR THE BERLIN MARATHON ON SEPTEMBER 27. CROSSING THE POND TO THE USA WAS PETER TUCKER WHO RAN THE CENTRAL PARK RUN FOR LIFE IN NEW YORK. TUCKER BRAVED THE HEAT TO FINISH THE 8KM RACE IN A RESPECTABLE 48:35. A GOOD TURNOUT AT THE BLACK PARK PARKRUN ON SATURDAY SAW SEVEN HARRIERS COMPETING WITH 462 OTHER RUNNERS. MATT ASHBY WAS FIRST HOME FOR THE HARRIERS IN A SPEEDY 19:16, FINISHING IN FIFTH POSITION OVERALL.  KEEP IT AWAY FROM WINDOWS AND APPLIANCES THAT GENERATE HEAT. ASHBY WAS CHASED HOME BY VINCE ELLERBY IN 20:03, IN 12TH PLACE. NEXT BACK WERE STEVE NEWING 20:12, PAULA COOK 26:45, CLAIRE NEWING 34:54 (PB), ALICE COOK 36:25 (PB) AND JENNY BARNETT 36:26. GADEBRIDGE PARKRUN HAD SIX GADE VALLEY HARRIERS FLYING THEIR COLOURS, WHERE JULIAN SMITH STORMED HOME IN THIRD OVERALL PLACE IN A TIME OF 20:32. SMITH FOLLOWED BY JOHNNY BROOM IN A NEW PB OF 22:20, EMMA PHILLPOT 24:48 (PB), MARTIN STORRIE 25:10, ANDY BISHOP 25:24 AND ANDY NORTON 28:33. IN LUTON, HARRIERS HELEN HEATHCOTE AND CAROL SKATES TOOK ON THEIR 5KM PARKRUN, WITH HEATHCOTE CROSSING THE LINE IN 29:47 AND TEAM-MATE SKATES IN 33:38. ANTHONY JAMES FROM GVH CHARGED ROUND THE ST ALBANS COURSE TO SET A NEW PB OF 18:20, CLAIMING EIGHTH PLACE. ALSO CLOCKING A NEW PB WAS JAMES THOMSON IN THE PANSHANGER PARKRUN IN WELWYN GARDEN CITY, BATTLING THE HILLS TO COME HOME IN 21:33. HAVE YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SHARE ON THE STORY? WERE YOU THERE?

344	OPEN KICKED OFF THIS WEEK IN NEW YORK. OF COURSE TWO OF THE BIGGEST STORYLINES INVOLVE SERENA WILLIAMS AND RAFAEL NADAL . THIS YEAR TWO OF THE MOST DOMINANT CHAMPIONS OF TENNIS ARE ON OPPOSITE CAREER TRAJECTORIES. SERENA WILLIAMS IS THE OWNER OF 21 MAJOR VICTORIES, SHE COMPLETED THE SERENA SLAM IN JULY AFTER WINNING WIMBLEDON AND IS NOW IN THE HUNT FOR A CALENDAR SLAM BY CLAIMING VICTORIES IN ALL FOUR MAJOR TOURNAMENTS IN 2015. ON FRIDAY, SERENA SHOWED SHE IS WELL ON HER WAY IN A COMEBACK VICTORY, BEATING BETHANIE MATTEK-SANDS TO SET UP A FOURTH-ROUND MATCH AGAINST MADISON KEYS. WHEN YOUR SPLITS GAME IS ON FLEEK AND YOU KNOW IT.  PIC.TWITTER.COM/4L2426AKDM WTA REACTIONS (@WTAREACTIONS) SEPTEMBER 5, 2015 MEANWHILE, NADAL WILL GO A CALENDAR YEAR WITHOUT WINNING ANY MAJOR TOURNAMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2004. RAFAEL LOST FRIDAY TO FABIO FOGNINI IN THIRD ROUND. VENUS?  THERES ANOTHER WILLIAMS MAKING A BUZZ AT THE U.S.OPEN, VENUS LOOKS LIKE SHES BACK ON THE UPSWING, AT 35 SHE KNOCKED OFF 12TH-SEEDED-18-YEAR-OLD BELINDA BENCIC, OF SWITZERLAND. VENUS HAS BEEN DEALING WITH THE SYMPTOMS OF THE CHRONIC AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE SJOGRENS SYNDROME OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. HER WIN AGAINST BENCIC MARKED THE THIRD TIME SINCE 2011 AND THE THIRD TIME THIS YEAR THAT SHE HAS ADVANCED PAST THE THIRD ROUND OF A GRAND SLAM TOURNAMENT.

345	U.S. SPACE AGENCY NASA ANNOUNCED ON MONDAY IT HAS FOUND "STRONG" EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS LIQUID WATER INTERMITTENTLY FLOWING ON PRESENT-DAY MARS. IMAGES TAKEN FROM THE MARS ORBIT SHOWED DARK, FINGER-LIKE MARKINGS THAT, TYPICALLY LESS THAN FIVE METERS IN WIDTH, APPEAR ON SLOPES DURING WARM SEASONS, LENGTHEN AND THEN FADE DURING COOLER SEASONS ON THE RED PLANET. THESE SURFACE FEATURES, KNOWN AS RECURRING SLOPE LINEAE (RSL), HAVE BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO FORM BY THE ACTIVITY OF BRINES, BUT DIRECT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN LACKING. NOW, USING AN IMAGING SPECTROMETER FROM NASA'S MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO), RESEARCHERS DETECTED SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED MINERALS ON SLOPES WHERE THE MYSTERIOUS STREAKS ARE SEEN ON MARS. "OUR QUEST ON MARS HAS BEEN TO 'FOLLOW THE WATER,' IN OUR SEARCH FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, AND NOW WE HAVE CONVINCING SCIENCE THAT VALIDATES WHAT WE'VE LONG SUSPECTED," SAID JOHN GRUNSFELD, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR OF NASA'S SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE IN WASHINGTON. "THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT, AS IT APPEARS TO CONFIRM THAT WATER -- ALBEIT BRINY -- IS FLOWING TODAY ON THE SURFACE OF MARS." THESE PUZZLING SURFACE FEATURES WERE FIRST NOTICED IN 2010 BY LUJENDRA OJHA, THEN A UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT, USING IMAGES FROM THE MRO'S HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING SCIENCE EXPERIMENT. IN THE NEW STUDY, OJHA, NOW A GRADUATE STUDENT AT GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, AND HIS COLLEAGUES ANALYZED SPECTRA DATA FROM THE COMPACT RECONNAISSANCE IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM) ABOARD THE MRO FROM FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHERE THE RSL FEATURES WERE PRESENT. THEY REPORTED IN THE BRITISH JOURNAL NATURE GEOSCIENCE THAT SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED SALTS AT THESE RSL LOCATIONS EXISTED ONLY WHEN THE DARK FEATURES WERE RELATIVELY WIDE. "WE FOUND THE HYDRATED SALTS ONLY WHEN THE SEASONAL FEATURES WERE WIDEST, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT EITHER THE DARK STREAKS THEMSELVES OR A PROCESS THAT FORMS THEM IS THE SOURCE OF THE HYDRATION," OJHA SAID. "IN EITHER CASE, THE DETECTION OF HYDRATED SALTS ON THESE SLOPES MEANS THAT WATER PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THESE STREAKS." THE RESEARCHERS INTERPRETED THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES AS CAUSED BY HYDRATED MINERALS CALLED PERCHLORATES, WHICH ARE LIKELY A MIXTURE OF MAGNESIUM PERCHLORATE, MAGNESIUM CHLORATE AND SODIUM PERCHLORATE. SOME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO KEEP LIQUIDS FROM FREEZING EVEN WHEN CONDITIONS ARE AS COLD AS MINUS 94 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT (MINUS 70 CELSIUS), NASA SAID. ON EARTH, NATURALLY PRODUCED PERCHLORATES ARE CONCENTRATED IN DESERTS, AND SOME TYPES OF PERCHLORATES CAN BE USED AS ROCKET PROPELLANT. PERCHLORATES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN ON MARS. FOR EXAMPLE, NASA'S PHOENIX LANDER AND CURIOSITY ROVER BOTH FOUND THEM IN THE PLANET'S SOIL, AND SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THAT THE VIKING MISSIONS IN THE 1970S MEASURED SIGNATURES OF THESE SALTS. "HOWEVER, THIS STUDY OF RSL DETECTED PERCHLORATES, NOW IN HYDRATED FORM, IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAN THOSE EXPLORED BY THE LANDERS," NASA SAID. "THIS ALSO IS THE FIRST TIME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM ORBIT." FOR OJHA, THE NEW FINDINGS ARE MORE PROOF THAT THE MYSTERIOUS LINES HE FIRST SAW DARKENING MARTIAN SLOPES FIVE YEARS AGO ARE, INDEED, PRESENT-DAY WATER. "WHEN MOST PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WATER ON MARS, THEY'RE USUALLY TALKING ABOUT ANCIENT WATER OR FROZEN WATER," HE SAID. "NOW WE KNOW THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY. THIS IS THE FIRST SPECTRAL DETECTION THAT UNAMBIGUOUSLY SUPPORTS OUR LIQUID WATER-FORMATION HYPOTHESES FOR RSL."
346	HE TRULY IS THE FASHION GENIUS HE THINKS HE IS KANYE WESTS SECOND COLLECTION FOR ADIDAS, WHICH DEBUTED AT THE NEW YORK FASHION WEEK 2015, WAS MET WIDELY WITH RIDICULE, BUT THE STILL THINKS HES A FASHION GENIUS. UNSURPRISINGLY, HIS WIFE KIM KARDASHIAN WEST IS OF THE SAME OPINION: HE IS A FASHION GENIUS BECAUSE HE IS THE ONE WHO TURNED HER INTO A FASHION ICON. THE LATEST VIDEO FROM CNN STYLE (SEE BELOW) FOCUSES ON KIMS RISE FROM DERIDED REALITY STAR TO THE STATUS OF CELEBRITY ALL DESIGNERS HWANT TO PUT IN THE FIRST ROW AT THEIR SHOWS. WHILE THE VIDEO UNDERLINES THAT KIMS INCLUSION IN THE HIGH FASHION WORLD WAS INEVITABLE BECAUSE DESIGNERS HAD STARTED UNDERSTANDING HER POPULARITY (WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH FASHION), SHE LIKES TO THINK ITS BECAUSE OF KANYE. KANYE CHANGED EVERYTHING SHORTLY AFTER KIM AND KANYE WENT PUBLIC WITH THEIR ROMANCE, HIS FIRST CAMEO ON KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS AIRED: IT SHOWED HIM GOING THROUGH HER WARDROBE AND TELLING HER THAT HE WOULD BE DRESSING HER FROM THEN ON. SINCE THEN, KANYE HAS BEEN KIMS STYLIST, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER FIRST PREGNANCY, WHEN SHE SAYS SHE HAD 5 DIFFERENT STYLISTS. THATS SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HORRIBLE SARTORIAL CHOICES SHE MADE THEN. TODAY, KIM KARDASHIAN IS WIDELY CONSIDERED A FASHION ICON, EVEN THOUGH MOST OF HER OUTFITS STILL PROVIDE CELEBRITY BLOGGERS WITH THE BEST JOKE MATERIAL POSSIBLE. I REALLY THINK THAT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY HUSBAND KANYE REALLY CHANGED EVERYTHING, KIM SAYS. I MEAN, BACK IN THE DAY I THOUGHT I HAD THE BEST STYLE. I LOOK BACK AT OUTFITS AND I'M, LIKE, MORTIFIED.  JUST HELPING ME PUSH MY LIMITS A LITTLE BIT AND TRYING NEW THINGS.  CLEARLY, SINCE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN HE LOVED, HE GETS A PASS, BUT THE WORLD KNOWS THAT KIM IS NEITHER FASHIONABLE NOR STYLISH.  EVEN THOUGH FASHION DESIGNERS WILL STILL MOCK HER (BUT ONLY AFTER THEY PUT HER IN THE FIRST ROW AT THEIR SHOWS), EVERYTHING SHE WEARS WILL STWILL BECOME A TREND BECAUSE ITS ON HER AND SHE HAS MILLIONS OF ADORING FANS, DYING TO REPLICATE HER LOOK.
347	THURSDAY AT 8 P.M. ET, VAN JONES WILL MODERATE A PANEL FEATURING THE VOICES OF NEW ORLEANS-BASED ORGANIZERS TALKING ABOUT THEIR LOCAL WORK FOR RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA. DEAR MOVEON MEMBER, IT'S BEEN 10 YEARS SINCE HURRICANE KATRINA CHANGED OUR COUNTRY. THE DISASTROUS FEDERAL RESPONSE TO THE STORM, THE LACK OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND SUPPORT FOR LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES, AND THE FAILURE OF OUR GOVERNMENT TO REBUILD ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE SHAPED OUR NATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO THE SUFFERING OF BLACK COMMUNITIES. OUR FRIENDS AT COLOROFCHANGE, THE COUNTRY'S LEADING ONLINE CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION THAT WAS FOUNDED IN THE STORM'S WAKE, ARE HOSTING AN IMPORTANT TOWN HALL TO REFLECT ON WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE HURRICANE KATRINA TORE THROUGH NEW ORLEANS AND SOUTHERN LOUISIANA. THIS THURSDAY AT 8 P.M. ET, AFTERMATH: THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK LIVES 10 YEARS AFTER KATRINAMODERATED BY CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND COLOROFCHANGE CO-FOUNDER VAN JONESWILL FEATURE THE VOICES OF NEW ORLEANS-BASED ORGANIZERS ON THEIR LOCAL WORK FOR RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR AFTERMATH: THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK LIVES 10 YEARS AFTER KATRINA. TEN YEARS AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA, BLACK WORKERS CONTINUE TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE ONGOING RECONSTRUCTION OF NEW ORLEANS, THOUGH MORE THAN $71 BILLION HAS BEEN SPENT TO RESTORE THE CITY. MORE THAN 50% OF THE CITY'S BLACK CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY, BLACK FAMILIES MAKE HALF THE INCOME OF WHITE FAMILIES, AND AS LITTLE AS 4% OF THE WORKFORCE ON CITY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IS BLACKEVEN WHILE 52% OF BLACK MEN IN NEW ORLEANS FACE UNEMPLOYMENT. COLOROFCHANGE IS JOINING NEW ORLEANS-BASED CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS TO DISCUSS ORGANIZING AND ACTIVISM IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA, RESISTANCE TO THE PRIVATIZATION OF SCHOOLS AND THE EXPANSION OF THE CRADLE-TO-PRISON PIPELINE, AND THE EXCLUSION OF BLACK WORKERS FROM QUALITY JOBS. THE ONLINE TOWN HALL WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT WITH FRONT-LINE ORGANIZERS IN THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK LIVES IN NEW ORLEANS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT STRUGGLES IN THE EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE THE ENTRENCHED PLANTATION ECONOMY, END WHITE SUPREMACY, AND BUILD A WORLD THAT RESPECTS BLACK LIVES IN SCHOOL, AT WORK, AND IN COMMUNITIES. CLICK HERE TO JOIN COLOROFCHANGE'S VIRTUAL TOWN HALL, AFTERMATH: THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK LIVES 10 YEARS AFTER KATRINA, MODERATED BY VAN JONES. THE EVENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, AT 8 P.M. ET.

348	FOR MOST, CONVENTION SEASON IS WINDING DOWN. WHILE YOU CAN FIND CONS AT ANY TIME OF YEAR REALLY, THE BULK OF THE MAJORCONS TAKE PLACE DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. BUT ONE MAJORCON IS DIFFERENT, CHOOSING TO FIGHT THE POWER AND PLACE ITSELF IN LATE OCTOBER OR EARLY NOVEMBER. AND SINCE I WONT BE MAKING IT TO ANY CONVENTIONS THIS CALENDAR YEAR, THAT MAKES THE 2014 WORLD FANTASY CONVENTION (WHICH I DID ATTEND) THE PERFECT ONE TO WRITE ABOUT. I CALL WFC A MAJORCON, BUT THATS REALLY MISLEADING. WHILE ITS A VERY VENERABLE CON WITH (IT WILL BE PUTTING ON ITS 40TH CONVENTION THIS YEAR IN SARATOGA SPRINGS, NY) AND IT HAS A MAJOR GENRE AWARD ATTACHED, WFCNUMBERS IN THE HUNDREDS RATHER THAN THE THOUSANDS OF ATTENDEES (TO SAY NOTHING OF TENS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS). AS OPPOSED TO BROADER MEDIA CONS, ITS ALSO ALMOST ENTIRELY FOCUSED ON BOOKS, AND IS ALMOST ENTIRELY FOCUSED ON BUSINESS RATHER THAN FANDOM. WFC IS A WORK CON. ITS A PLACE TO GO AND NETWORK, TO MEET PEOPLE SERIOUS ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF WRITING AND PUBLISHING. AS SUCH, IF YOURE SOMEONE LIKE ME, WHO DOESNT HAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR CON ATTENDANCE, IT OFFERS A STRONG BANG FOR YOUR BUCK FACTOR IF YOUR MAIN GOAL IS NETWORKING. BUT I DONT WANT TO MAKE IT SOUND BORING, BECAUSE ITS ANYTHING BUT. SURE, THE FOCUS MAY BE ON BUSINESS, BUT THIS IS STILL A PLACE TO MEET UP WITH FRIENDS IN THE INDUSTRY AND A GATHERING OF SOME OF THE WORLDS BIGGEST GENRE GEEKS. WHILE ITS TRUE THAT COSPLAYERS ARE GENERALLY NOWHERE TO BE SEEN, THERE IS STILL PLENTY TO ENJOY. BOTH TIMES IVE BEEN (2014 AND 2012 NEAR TORONTO) I HAD A GREAT TIME. AND FRANKLY, AS A PRETTY STRONG INTROVERT, WFCS SMALLER SIZE IS APPEALING TO ME (AND I SUSPECT IM NOT THE ONLY INTROVERT TO WHOM THAT WOULD BE TRUE). AS A VIRGINIA NATIVE, WHEN I LEARNED THAT WFC 2014 WOULD BE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. (AND I SAY THAT IN QUOTES BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY IN CRYSTAL CITY, VIRGINIA, JUST OVER THE POTOMAC RIVER FROM D.C.), I KNEW IT WOULD BE CRIMINAL NOT TO ATTEND. HAVING A MAJOR CON SHOW UP WITHIN DRIVING DISTANCE REALLY GIVES YOU NO EXCUSE TO DO OTHERWISE. AS WITH MANY CONS OF THIS SORT, WHILE THE PANELS PROVIDE A LOT OF QUALITY PROGRAMMING, THE REAL ACTION HAPPENS IN AND AROUND THE HOTEL BAR. YOULL FIND CONVENTION GOERS THERE AT ALL TIMES OF DAY, THEIR ONLY CONCESSION TO THE RISING SUN SWITCHING TO COFFEE INSTEAD OF HARDER STUFF. ITS ALWAYS SURREAL TO ROAM AROUND THE BAR AREA, NOTICING VARIOUS WRITERS AND PUBLISHING GIANTS JUST SITTING AROUND, TALKING BUSINESS OR JUST SHOOTING THE BREEZE. I EVEN GOT TO DISCUSS THE 2014 NCAA COLLEGE FOOTBALL SEASON WITH LITERARY AGENT EXTRAORDINAIRE (AND MICHIGAN WOLVERINES FAN) JOSHUA BILMES AFTER HE NOTICED MY VIRGINIA TECH SHIRT. AS I ALLUDED TO ABOVE, WFC IS ALSO THE KEEPER OF THE WORLD FANTASY AWARDS, IN THE PAST WON BY SUCH LUMINARIES AS GEORGE R.R. MARTIN, CHINA MIEVILLE, SUSANNA CLARKE, MADELINE LENGLE, GENE WOLFE AND URSULA K. LE GUIN. THE AWARD WINNERS ARE SELECTED BY A COMMITTEE FROM A POOL OF NOMINEES SUPPLIED BY CONFERENCE GOERS.THERE IS A BANQUET TO ANNOUNCE THE WINNERS AT THE END OF THE CONVENTION, WHICH ANY ATTENDEE (PROVIDED THEY PAID THE EXTRA FEE) MAY ATTEND. I ATTENDED IN 2012 BUT DIDNT FEEL THE NEED TO DO SO AGAIN IN 2014, PREFERRING INSTEAD TO GET HOME A LITTLE EARLIER. I CAME BACK FROM LAST YEARS CONVENTION WITHA BUNCH OF NEW FRIENDS,A SUBMISSION REQUEST FROM AN EDITOR, SOME GREAT LOOT (A PRINT OF THE A MEMORY OF LIGHT COVER ART SIGNED BY BRANDON SANDERSON AND MICHAEL WHELAN AND A EARLY-RELEASE SIGNED COPY OF THE JEFF VANDERMEER AREA X OMNIBUS), MASSIVE SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND A WHOLE LOT OF FUN MEMORIES. IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, MY ONLY CHANGE WOULD BE TO DETERMINE THAT OUR HOTEL WOULDNT ALLOW MORE THAN TWO BEDS DUE TO FIRE CODE RESTRICTIONS. IT MADE FOR A DIFFICULT SLEEP SITUATION FOR OUR THIRD ROOMMATE. AT SOME POINT, I AM FATED BY KARMA TO SLEEP ON THE FLOOR OF A HOTEL ROOM IN MARTINS NAME. SO IF, LIKE ME, YOU HAVE TO CAREFULLY PICK YOUR CONVENTIONS AND MAXIMIZE YOUR LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTEND, GIVE WORLD FANTASY CONVENTION A TRY. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: GREGORY D.

349	DRIVE TO THE GROCERY STORE, WATER YOUR PLANTS. THE 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI IS THE JAPANESE AUTOMAKERS FIRST PRODUCTION HYDROGEN FUEL CELL SEDAN AND IS CLOSE TO BEING LAUNCHED IN CALIFORNIA. THE MIRAI, ALONG WITH THE HYUNDAI TUCSON AND HONDA FCV, ARE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES (FCEV) THAT USES COMPRESSED HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IN A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT CREATES ELECTRICITY TO POWER A COMPACT MOTOR, WHICH IN TURN DRIVES THE FRONT WHEELS. THE ONLY EMISSION IS WATER VAPOR. THE TOYOTA MIRAI PROMISES A 312-MILE RANGE BETWEEN HYDROGEN FILL-UPS, ROOM FOR FOUR PASSENGERS AND A REFUELING TIME OF THREE TO FOUR MINUTES (H70/700 BAR). UNLIKE A PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE, THERES NO WAITING HOURS FOR THE BATTERY TO RECHARGE. WITH A TOP SPEED OF 111 MPH AND ZERO-TO-60 MPH TIMES OF LESS THAN 10 SECONDS, PERFORMANCE IS SIMILAR TO AN EV SUCH AS THE NISSAN LEAF AND VW E-GOLF. A LITTLE LARGER THAN ITS HYBRID COUSINS, THE PRIUS AND CT 200H, THE MIRAI IS BUILT ON A PLATFORM THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY USED BY THE RETIRED LEXUS HS 250H. SIZE MATTERS AND EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE PROPULSION SYSTEM, BATTERY, AND TWO LIGHTWEIGHT CARBON FIBER REINFORCED PLASTIC, HIGH-PRESSURE HYDROGEN TANKS HAD TO FIT. MANY COMPONENTS OF THE ELECTRIC-DRIVE SYSTEM ARE SHARED WITH TOYOTAS HYBRID DRIVETRAIN WITH THE BENEFIT OF KEEPING BUILD COSTS DOWN. DRIVING IMPRESSIONS PROMISING A PUNCH OF 152 HORSEPOWER AND 247 LB-FT OF TORQUE, THE ENGINE FEELS REASONABLY STRONG AND ALSO HAS A POWER MODE THAT RELEASES MORE HYDROGEN INTO THE FUEL CELL STACK. EVEN THOUGH IT SHARES ELECTRIC POWERTRAIN BITS FROM THE PRIUS, THE MIRAI IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN ITS HYBRID COUSIN. CABIN MATERIALS ARE NICER THAN A PRIUS AND IT HAS MANY PREMIUM FEATURES THAT YOU WONT FIND IN A PRIUS. PLUS, THIS IS A HEAVIER CAR THAT WEIGHS 1,006 POUNDS MORE THAN A REGULAR PRIUS, AND YOU FEEL THE EXTRA WEIGHT PUSHING THE CAR INTO CORNERS. REALISTICALLY, THE MIRAI HAS PLENTY OF PEP FOR A CAR WHERE PERFORMANCE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A SELLING POINT. MASHING THE THROTTLE TO THE FLOOR FROM A DEAD- OR ROLLING-STOP INVIGORATES THE MIRAI WITH INSTANTANEOUS TORQUE RESPONSE FROM THE ELECTRIC MOTOR. TRYING TO COAX MORE ACCELERATION FOR PASSING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IS A SLOW AND STEADY PROCESS A BEHAVIOR THAT IS TYPICAL WITH HYBRIDS AND EVS. TOYOTA THINKS MOST BUYERS OF THE MIRAI WILL BE MORE APPRECIATIVE OF THE SMOOTH, COMFORTABLE RIDE OVER A SPORTY EDGE. I DROVE THE 2016 MIRAI FOR A DAY AND INTO THE NIGHT, AND LOGGED 262 MILES. AT THE END OF MY TEST DRIVE THE MIRAI REPORTED A MILES PER GALLON EQUIVALENCY (MPGE) OF 60 COMPARED TO THE FACTORY SPEC OF 67 MPGE. THIS WAS MY SECOND TIME BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE MIRAI THE FIRST EXPERIENCE WAS LIMITED TO A 5 MINUTE TEST DRIVE AROUND THE BLOCK AND A DISTANCE LESS THAN TWO MILES. THIS TIME I HAD THE FULL EXPERIENCE AND DROVE IT FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, TO SACRAMENTO, THEN TO THE EAST BAY FOR MORE DRIVING TIME AT NIGHT. I WAS EXPECTING THE MIRAI TO DRIVE SIMILAR TO AN EV, BUT HAD A TOTAL CHANGE IN ATTITUDE BY THE TIME I WAS READY TO RETURN THE KEY TO TOYOTA. THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS ZERO-EMISSION CAR, AND VERY FEW THAT ARENT SO GOOD. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT I APPRECIATED WAS THE HUSH TONE OF THE CABIN AND ITS ABILITY TO INSULATE THE PASSENGERS FROM ROAD NOISE. THE COMBINATION OF ACOUSTIC GLASS, SOUND ABSORBING MATERIALS, AND SOUND-INSULATING MATERIALS PLACED INSIDE THE BODY FRAME WORK TOGETHERREDUCING NOISE AND VIBRATIONS; THE CARPETS ARE FITTED WITHOUT ANY GAPS AND THERE ARE LOTS OF SOFT-TOUCH SURFACES THAT ABSORB SOUND. EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER RESULTING IN A QUIET, REFINED TRIP THAT IS ON PAR WITH A LEXUS ES OR GS. THE STEERING RESPONSE HAS A LIGHT FEEL AND SOMEWHAT NUMB, BUT OVERALL IT IS GOOD FOR BEING ELECTRIC POWER ASSISTED. HANDLING AND RIDE QUALITY IS EVEN BETTER. THERE IS MINIMAL BODY LEAN CARVING THROUGH THE CORNERS AND THE RIDE QUALITY, WHICH FEELS ON THE FIRM SIDE, IS NOT BUMPY OR HARSH FEELING. THE 4,078 POUND CURB WEIGHT PROBABLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE SMOOTH, PLUSH RIDE. THE SEATS ARE INJECTION-MOLDED AND COVERED IN A PSUEDO-LEATHER MATERIAL CALLED SOFTEX, WHILE COMFORTABLE AND CONFORMING, THE MATERIAL ISNT NICE TO TOUCH. I HAVE A SMALL BODY FRAME AND DID NOT NOTICE MYSELF SQUIRMING IN THE SEAT TO FIND A COMFORTABLE SPOT, NOR WAS I SLIDING AROUND WHEN TESTING THE CORNERING CAPABILITIES. THE FRONT AND REAR SEATS ARE HEATED, BUT NEITHER SETUP WITH FANS UNDERNEATH FOR COOLING. THE CABIN DESIGN HAS A SCULPTED DASHBOARD AND AN INFORMATION DISPLAY MOUNTED HIGH AND CENTERED. SCROLLING THROUGH THE MULTITUDE OF DISPLAY SCREENS REPORT INFORMATION ON ENERGY USAGE, MPGE DIARY, HOW GOOD (OR POORLY) YOUR DRIVING STYLE HAS AFFECTED FUEL CONSUMPTION, AND MORE. NAVIGATION, INFOTAINMENT AND CLIMATE CONTROLS ARE ACCESSIBLE ON ANOTHER PANEL BELOW THE CENTRAL DISPLAY SCREENS. THE ELECTROSTATIC TOUCHSCREEN SWITCHES ARE MODERN AND ATTRACTIVE, BUT GETS MESSY WITH FINGERPRINTS AND SMUDGES EASILY. THE MIRAI IS WELL EQUIPPED WITH LED HEADLAMPS, HEATED STEERING WHEEL, INDIVIDUAL AUTOMATIC CLIMATE CONTROL FOR THE FRONT PASSENGERS, AND ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL. BACK SEAT PASSENGERS HAVE HEATED SEATS AND PLENTY OF LEGROOM. BECAUSE THE REAR SEATS SIT ABOVE THE HYDROGEN TANKS, HEADROOM IS LIMITED. MIRAI ALSO HAS A BROAD RANGE OF STANDARD ONBOARD SAFETY TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING VEHICLE PRE-COLLISION, BLIND SPOT MONITOR, LANE DEPARTURE ALERT, DRIVE START CONTROL AND AUTOMATIC HIGH BEAMS. BEGINNING FALL 2015, THE MIRAI IS ONLY GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS WHOSE APPLICATION IS ACCEPTED BY TOYOTA. INITIALLY, EIGHT DEALERSHIPS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO SELL 700 UNITS OF THE HYDROGEN FUEL-CELL CAR, BUT THE PROGRAM WILL EXPAND UP TO 2,000 UNITS NEXT YEAR AND EVENTUALLY BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE NORTHEAST STATES OF CONNECTICUT, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, AND RHODE ISLAND. EARLY ADOPTERS BEWARE THE COST TO OWN A 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI OUTRIGHT IS $58,325, OR LEASE IT FOR $499 A MONTH FOR 36 MONTHS WITH $3,649 DUE AT SIGNING. IF YOU CHOOSE TO PURCHASE A MIRAI, THERE ARE FEDERAL AND STATE INCENTIVES AVAILABLE, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE PRICE BY AS MUCH AS $13,000. THE PURCHASE PRICE INCLUDES THREE YEARS OR $15,000 WORTH OF FREE HYDROGEN FUEL FOR THE CAR; A WEEKS WORTH OF RENTAL-CAR ACCESS FOR THE FIRST THREE YEAR; A HYDROGEN FUEL STATION FINDER APP; 24/7 CUSTOMER SUPPORT; AND AN EIGHT-YEAR, 100,000-MILE HYDROGEN POWERTRAIN WARRANTY. ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES ARE ALLOWED ACCESS TO CALIFORNIAS HIGH OCCUPANCY (HOV) LANES, WHICH IS A GOOD PERK IF YOURE COMMUTING ALONE. LOCATING A REFUELING STATION WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR EARLY ADOPTERS, MUCH LIKE TRYING TO FIND AN EV CHARGING STATION A FEW YEARS AGO. CALIFORNIA HAS PLANS TO OPEN 56 HYDROGEN REFUELING STATIONS IN SELECT AREAS UP THROUGH AUTUMN 2016, OF WHICH EIGHT ARE OFFICIALLY OPEN NOW. CHECK THE CALIFORNIA FUEL CELL PARTNERSHIP (WWW.CAFCP.ORG) WEBSITE FOR MAPS AND CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLANNED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AND THE PROGRAMS PROGRESS. THE WEBSITE IS ALSO A GOOD SOURCE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE COLLABORATION THAT IS HAPPENING WITH INVOLVED GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AUTOMAKERS, AND ENERGY PROVIDERS. USING THE TFL CAR SCALE OF BUY IT! LEASE IT! RENT IT! OR FORGET IT! THE MIRAI GETS EARNS A LEASE IT! FOR ITS ADVANCED ENGINEERING, NEAR-LUXURY RIDE AND COMFORT, AND BETTER THAN AVERAGE RIDE QUALITY. IT LOSES POINTS FOR ITS EXPENSIVE ENTRY PRICE, LACK OF FEEDBACK THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL, AND THE TOUCH QUALITY OF THE SEAT MATERIAL AND PANEL SWITCHES. PLUS, ITS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO BE TIED TO EVOLVING AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGIES SHORT-TERM. WHILE THE MIRAI LEADS US DOWN THE PATH OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND ZERO EMISSIONS, AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS SIMPLY A CAR THAT DOES ITS JOB WELL AND HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF PROVIDING WATER FOR YOUR PLANTS. 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI SPECS: TYPE: POLYMER ELECTROLYTE FUEL CELL MAX.

352	NEEDHAM, MASS.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- INFINIDAT, A LEADER IN HIGH PERFORMANCE, HIGHLY AVAILABLE ENTERPRISE STORAGE SOLUTIONS, ANNOUNCES THE EXPANSION OF ITS REVOLUTIONARY INFINIBOX FAMILY OF STORAGE ARRAYS WITH THE ADDITION OF TWO NEW CAPABILITIES AND A NEW MIDRANGE MODEL. NAS FILE SUPPORT (NFSV3) AS A FREE SOFTWARE UPGRADE NAS (NETWORK-ATTACHED STORAGE) FUNCTIONALITY CAN BE ENABLED ON ALL NEW AND EXISTING INFINIBOX SYSTEMS (VIA A NON-DISRUPTIVE SOFTWARE UPGRADE) TO PROVIDE TRULY ENTERPRISE-CLASS UNIFIED STORAGE. INFINIDATS NAS CAPABILITY IS DESIGNED FOR HYPER-SCALE WORKLOADS SUPPORTING HIGH PERFORMANCE ACCESS TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF FILES AND MULTI-PETABYTES OF CAPACITY ON A SINGLE FILE SYSTEM. THIS IS A TRUE, NATIVE SOFTWARE-BASED NAS IMPLEMENTATION (COMPLETELY IN-HOUSE DEVELOPED), NOT A NAS FRONT-END BOLTED ONTO A BLOCK DEVICE. IN ADDITION, THE NAS CAPABILITY SUPPORTS ALL THE SAME ADVANCED INFINIBOX FEATURES PROVIDED BY INFINIDATS CURRENT BLOCK STORAGE: A SINGLE AUTOMATED MANAGEMENT CONSOLE; ZERO LATENCY; NON-BLOCKING HIGH PERFORMANCE SNAPSHOTS; THIN, SMART CLONES; SELF-HEALING HIGH-AVAILABILITY; HYBRID DISK/SSD INFRASTRUCTURE AND NON-DISRUPTIVE UPGRADES. INFINIBOX F2000, A NEW MIDRANGE STORAGE ARRAY DESIGNED TO FULFILL THE NEEDS OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE DATA VOLUMES IN THE SUB-PETABYTE RANGE, THE INFINIBOX F2000 STARTS AT 250TB USABLE CAPACITY IN AN 18U CONFIGURATION. IT JOINS THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL INFINIBOX F6000, WHICH CONTAINS UP TO 2PB OF USABLE STORAGE IN A SINGLE 42U RACK FORM FACTOR. BOTH THE F2000 AND F6000 DELIVER 99.99999% AVAILABILITY (LESS THAN 3 SECONDS OF DOWNTIME PER YEAR), LOW POWER CONSUMPTION (BETWEEN 3-8 KW AT PEAK), FULL MANAGEMENT AND PROVISIONING AUTOMATION, AND ULTRA-HIGH PERFORMANCE. NEAR-SYNC REPLICATION THE NEW INFINIDAT ASYNCHRONOUS REPLICATION IS SO EFFICIENT THAT USERS CAN SET AN RPO OF LESS THAN 4 SECONDS. THIS IS A UNIQUE CAPABILITY WHEN COMPARED TO COMPETITIVE SYSTEMS THAT TYPICALLY DELIVER RPOS OF MINUTES. SNAPSHOTS AND ASYNC REPLICATION ARE INCLUDED WITH EVERY INFINIBOX SYSTEM. "AS A CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDER, WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS A HIGH PERFORMING SHARED SAN SOLUTION ON WHICH THEY COULD BECOME QUICKLY PROVISIONED," SAID ANDREW HODES, CTO AT INETU. "WE FOUND THAT THE INFINIBOX OUTPERFORMED EVERY OTHER SPINNING DISK AND HYBRID SOLUTION WE TESTED. WHAT WAS MORE IMPRESSIVE IS THAT THE INFINIBOX PERFORMANCE WAS NEAR THAT OF AN ALL-FLASH ARRAY IN MANY BENCHMARKS AND AT A FRACTION OF THE COST PER GB. WE CONDUCTED NUMEROUS FAILURE TESTS, RANGING FROM TAKING OUT A NODE TO PULLING MULTIPLE DISKS, AND THE INFINIBOX DIDNT BLINK AN EYE." "INFINIDATS INNOVATIVE NEW CAPABILITIES PROVIDE COMPANIES WITH GREATER STORAGE FLEXIBILITY AND CONVENIENCE FOR A WIDE-VARIETY OF MISSION-CRITICAL AND BUSINESS-CRITICAL WORKLOADS," SAID JACK RONDONI, VICE PRESIDENT, STORAGE NETWORKING, AT BROCADE. "OUR MUTUAL CUSTOMERS NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THESE CAPABILITIES ALONG WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF BROCADE SAN AND IP STORAGE SWITCHES TO MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF AVAILABILITY AND THROUGHPUT." INFINIBOX MODELS ARE SCALABLE UP TO 2PB OF USABLE STORAGE CAPACITY IN A SINGLE 19-INCH/42U RACK, OFFER 99.99999% AVAILABILITY, DELIVER ULTRA-HIGH PERFORMANCE OF OVER 750K IOPS, AND ENABLE EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH THROUGHPUT OF UP TO 12.5 GB/S. INFINIDAT SYSTEMS ARE ALSO EXTREMELY POWER-EFFICIENT, DRAWING A MAXIMUM OF BETWEEN 3-8KW AT FULL LOAD. ALL INFINIBOX STORAGE ARRAYS ARE BASED UPON THE UNIQUE INFINIDAT STORAGE ARCHITECTURE (ISA). ISA PROVIDES SOFTWARE-DRIVEN STORAGE FUNCTIONALITY THAT IS FULLY ABSTRACTED FROM STANDARD X86 BASED HARDWARE. THIS SOFTWARE ABSTRACTION ALLOWS INFINIDAT TO CONTINUOUSLY EXPLOIT THE LATEST HARDWARE INNOVATIONS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE FOR EXCEPTIONAL PRICE/PERFORMANCE. WITH OVER 100 SOFTWARE PATENTS, ISA DELIVERS: SIMPLICITY - TO REDUCE COMPLEXITY, INFINIDAT HAS CREATED A SET OF POWERFUL SOFTWARE TOOLS THAT PROVIDE STATE-OF-THE-ART RAPID PROVISIONING, AUTOMATED HOST CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT, WORKFLOW BEST PRACTICE SETTINGS/COMPLIANCE, AND OVERALL STORAGE OPERATIONS. AVAILABILITY END-TO-END DATA PROTECTION, TRIPLE REDUNDANT POWER AND DATA PATHS, SNAPSHOTS AND REPLICATION, HOT SWAP UPGRADES AND MANY OTHER RELIABILITY FEATURES BUILT IN TO THE CORE OS LAYER. CAPACITY INFINIBOX SYSTEMS START AT 250TB AND SCALE TO UP TO 2PB OF USABLE STORAGE IN A SINGLE RACK. THERE ARE NO INCREMENTAL SOFTWARE LICENSING FEES WITH INFINIBOX. ALL SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES, INCLUDING THE NEW NAS AND NEAR-SYNC REPLICATION FEATURES, ARE INCLUDED IN THE BASE PRICE. IN ADDITION, ALL INFINIBOX STORAGE ARRAYS COME STANDARD WITH THREE YEARS OF 24X7X365 MAINTENANCE. INDUSTRY ANALYST REACTION "MANY VENDORS IN THE INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN SLOWLY FLASH-OPTIMIZING THEIR LEGACY ARRAYS OVER TIME TO MAKE BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENT USE OF FLASH MEDIA, BUT INFINIDAT STARTED WITH A CLEAN SHEET OF PAPER TO CREATE A GENERAL PURPOSE, HYBRID STORAGE ARRAY THAT VERY EFFICIENTLY BLENDS THE USE OF FLASH AND SPINNING DISK MEDIA IN AN ULTRA-RELIABLE, EXTREMELY HIGH PERFORMANCE PACKAGE TARGETED FOR DENSE, MIXED ENTERPRISE WORKLOAD CONSOLIDATION," SAID ERIC BURGENER, RESEARCH DIRECTOR, STORAGE AT IDC. "FEATURES IN THIS LATEST RELEASE, INCLUDING NFS FILE SUPPORT AND A NEAR SYNCHRONOUS REPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION, HELP TO MAKE THIS PLATFORM A GREAT CONSOLIDATION PLAY THAT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY AND COST-EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY STORAGE ENVIRONMENTS BASED AROUND EITHER BLOCK OR FILE PROTOCOLS." "ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS ARE DISCOVERING THE POWER OF THE INFINIBOX STORAGE SOLUTION TO HANDLE MASSIVE WORKLOADS WITH SPEED AND PROVIDE ULTRA-HIGH LEVELS OF AVAILABILITY," SAID SCOTT SINCLAIR, SENIOR ANALYST AT ENTERPRISE STRATEGY GROUP. "WITH THIS UPGRADE, INFINIDAT IS MEETING THE NEEDS OF SMALL AS WELL AS LARGE ENTERPRISES BY PROVIDING THE SAME PERFORMANCE AND AVAILABILITY AS THE LARGER CAPACITY INFINIBOX AT A SMALLER VOLUME SCALE." "ROME WASNT BUILT IN A DAY, AND NEITHER WAS GOOD ENTERPRISE STORAGE. THE KEY ADVANTAGE INFINIDAT HAS IS THAT THE FOUNDATION OF ITS INFINIBOX STORAGE ARRAY IS EXTREMELY STRONG AND THE BASELINE FUNCTIONALITY IS ALREADY REMARKABLE," SAID ARUN TANEJA, FOUNDER AND CONSULTING ANALYST AT TANEJA GROUP. "WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, INFINIDAT IS ADDING SOLID CAPABILITIES THAT WILL FURTHER DELIGHT ITS CUSTOMERS." "BUSINESSES DEPEND ON HAVING RAPID, ALWAYS ON ACCESS TO THEIR DATA, AS THAT DATA IS CRITICAL TO THEIR SURVIVAL," SAID MOSHE YANAI, INFINIDAT FOUNDER AND CEO. "WITH THE GROWTH OF DIGITIZED DATA OUTPACING THE GROWTH OF STORAGE CAPACITY, THE MARKET FOR STORAGE CONTINUES TO SEE RAPID GROWTH. HOWEVER, THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF STORAGE ARE FORCING BUYERS TO CONSTANTLY MAKE TRADE-OFFS. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, INFINIDAT HAS BROUGHT TO MARKET INFINIBOX, A NEW GENERATION OF HIGHLY RELIABLE, SCALABLE, FAST AND EFFICIENT STORAGE SYSTEMS." INFINIDAT BEGAN SHIPPING PRODUCT IN LATE 2013 AND HAS PLACED OVER A QUARTER EXABYTE OF STORAGE CAPACITY IN PRODUCTION IN MAJOR ENTERPRISE DATA CENTERS AROUND THE WORLD. INFINIDAT CUSTOMERS INCLUDE F500 COMPANIES IN FINANCE AND BANKING, GOVERNMENT, HEALTHCARE, ENERGY, AND CLOUD SERVICES. FOUNDED IN 2011 BY VETERAN ENTERPRISE STORAGE VISIONARY, MOSHE YANAI (EMC, XIV, IBM), INFINIDAT IS FUNDED BY INDUSTRY LEADING INVESTORS TPG GROWTH AND MII VENTURES.

354	THE SEC HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS AND ISSUES RELATING TO THE HIRING OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS FOR SOME TIME. NOW IT HAS FILED A SETTLED ACTION CENTERED ON BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES WHICH CONTAINS A CAUTIONARY NOTE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT UPDATED THEIR COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES IN VIEW OF THESE INQUIRIES. IN THE MATTER OF THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION, ADM. PROC. FILE NO. 3-16762 (AUGUST 18, 2015). RESPONDENT BNY MELLON IS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM WHICH AT TIMES OPERATES THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES. ONE UNIT IS BNYM ASSET SERVICING. ANOTHER IS WHOLLY OWNED BNY MELLON BOUTIQUE, AN ASSET MANAGEMENT FIRM. MIDDLE EASTERN SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND BECAME A CLIENT OF BNYM ASSET SERVICING IN 2000. THE SERVICES WERE LARGELY CUSTODIAL. THE UNIT MAINTAINED ABOUT $55 BILLION IN ASSETS FOR THE WEALTH FUND. TWO YEARS LATER ASSET SERVICING ENTERED INTO AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE WEALTH FUND UNDER WHICH THE ASSETS COULD BE LOANED OUT IN ACCORD WITH CERTAIN GUIDELINES. FOLLOWING THE MARKET CRISIS, DURING WHICH THE LENDING TERMS WERE CONSTRICTED, ASSET SERVICING SOUGHT TO EXPAND THE TERMS UNDER WHICH THOSE LOANS COULD BE MADE. IN 2009 THE WEALTH FUND BECAME A CLIENT OF ASSET MANAGEMENT, DESIGNATING THE BOUTIQUE TO MANAGE ABOUT $711 MILLION IN ASSETS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT THE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT COULD BE INCREASED. OFFICIALS X AND Y, BOTH SENIOR OFFICIALS CONNECTED TO THE WEALTH FUND, BEGAN SEEKING INTERNSHIPS FOR RELATIVES IN 2010. AT THE TIME BNY MELLON HAD AN ESTABLISHED SUMMER INTERNSHIP PROGRAM FOR UNDERGRADUATES. THERE WAS A SEPARATE SUMMER PROGRAM FOR POSTGRADUATES ACTIVELY PURSUING AN MBA OR SIMILAR DEGREE. ADMISSION TO THE POSTGRADUATE PROGRAM WAS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND GOVERNED BY STRINGENT HIRING STANDARDS. OFFICIAL X REQUESTED THAT INTERN A, HIS SON, AND INTERN B, HIS NEPHEW, BE HIRED. HE REPEATED HIS REQUEST IN A NUMBER OF EMAILS. HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS WAS MORE OF A PERSONAL REQUEST AND THAT THE WEALTH FUND WAS NOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT. INTERNALLY AT THE BANK, OFFICIAL X WAS ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE A KEY DECISION MAKER. THE REQUEST WAS GRANTED, ALTHOUGH NONE OF THE PROGRAM HIRING STANDARDS WERE FOLLOWED. BNY MELLON RETAINED THE BOUTIQUE MANDATE AND FURTHER ASSETS WERE TRANSFERRED BY OFFICIAL XS DEPARTMENT WITHIN A FEW MONTHS. OFFICIAL Y SOUGHT TO HAVE INTERN C, HIS SON, RETAINED. OFFICIAL Y WAS VIEWED AS ESSENTIAL TO OBTAINING NEW BUSINESS BY THE BANK. AT THE TIME OF THE REQUEST A NUMBER OF CLIENT SERVICE ISSUES HAD THREATENED TO WEAKEN THE RELATIONSHIP. AFTER RETAINING INTERN C, WITHOUT FOLLOWING THE USUAL HIRING PROCESS, BNY MELLON RETAINED ITS EXISTING CUSTODY AND SECURITIES LENDING BUSINESS WHICH CONTINUED TO GROW. THE INTERNSHIPS FOR INTERNS A, B AND C WERE CUSTOMIZED ONE-OF A-KIND- TRAINING PROGRAMS CRAFTED FOR THESE INTERNS. THEY WERE NEITHER INEXPENSIVE NOR EASY FOR BNY MELLON TO STRUCTURE, ACCORDING TO THE ORDER. NEVERTHELESS, THE INTERNS TURNED OUT TO BE LESS THAN EXEMPLARY EMPLOYEES. BHY MELLON HAD A CODE OF CONDUCT AND A SPECIFIC FCPA POLICY. DURING THE TIME PERIOD, HOWEVER, BNY MELLON HAD FEW SPECIFIC CONTROLS RELATING TO THE HIRING OF CUSTOMERS AND RELATIVES OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ACCORDING TO THE ORDER. HERE THE SENIOR MANAGERS WERE ABLE TO APPROVE THE HIRING OF THE INTERNS WITHOUT ANY REVIEW BY PERSONS WITH LEGAL OR COMPLIANCE BACKGROUNDS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ORDER NOTES, THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS WERE DEFICIENT. THE ORDER ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF EXCHANGE ACT SECTION 30A AND SECTION 13(B)(2)(B). THE COMMISSION ACKNOWLEDGED THE COOPERATION OF BNY MELLON AND ITS REMEDIAL ACTS WHICH, PRIOR TO THE SECS INVESTIGATION, INCLUDED INITIATING REFORMS TO ITS ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY TO ADDRESS THE HIRING OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS RELATIVES. TO RESOLVE THE CASE RESPONDENT CONSENTED TO THE ENTRY OF A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER BASED ON THE SECTIONS CITED IN THE ORDER. IN ADDITION, BNY MELLON AGREED TO PAY DISGORGEMENT OF $8.3 MILLION, PREJUDGMENT INTEREST AND A CIVIL MONEY PENALTY OF $5 MILLION. BNY MELLON ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A PENALTY OF OVER $5 MILLION WAS NOT IMPOSED BASED ON ITS COOPERATION.
355	MR. FEMI ADESINA | CREDITS: SUNNEWSONLINE.COM SOME CALL IT THE BUHARI BOUNCE. OTHERS DESCRIBE IT AS THE BUHARI EFFECT. YET SOME OTHERS SAY IT IS THE BUHARI AURA. ONE THING IS HOWEVER CRYSTAL CLEAR. THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN THE SAME IN THE PAST 100 DAYS IN NIGERIA, SINCE MUHAMMADU BUHARI ASSUMED THE PRESIDENCY. A NEW SHERIFF HAS TRULY COME TO TOWN. EXACTLY 100 DAYS AGO, HE CLIMBED THE PODIUM AT EAGLE SQUARE IN ABUJA AND GOT INAUGURATED AS PRESIDENT, 30 YEARS AFTER HE HAD BEEN TOPPLED FROM POWER AS MILITARY HEAD OF STATE. HE PROMISED TO BELONG TO NOBODY, AND TO BELONG TO EVERYBODY. IT IS A PLEDGE THAT STILL RESONATES LOUDLY TODAY, AND WILL SURELY ECHO FOR A LONG TIME TO COME. ON A DAY LIKE THIS, YOU WOULD EXPECT A PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN TO CHRONICLE THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS PRINCIPAL IN OFFICE. HE HAS TURNED STONE TO BREAD, SLAIN THE DRAGON, AND CLIMBED MOUNT OLYMPUS IN TEN SECONDS. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO DO. THERE ARE SOME INTANGIBLE, ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE ACHIEVEMENTS, BUT WHICH RUN VERY DEEP, AND ARE QUITE FUNDAMENTAL. THOSE ARE THE ONES ILL RATHER TALK OF, WHILE WE LEAVE THE TANGIBLES TILL SOME OTHER DAY. > OH, HES ESCAPING. THERE ARE NO CONCRETE ACHIEVEMENTS, SOME WAILING WAILERS WOULD CRY. TRUE? NOT TRUE. I COULD HAVE DECIDED TO FOCUS ON THE BLOODY NOSE BEING GIVEN TO BOKO HARAM IN THE NORTH-EAST, WHICH WOULD SEE THE COUNTRY RID OF INSURGENCY SOON, THE RALLYING OF LEADERS OF OTHER NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO DEPLOY A JOINT MULTINATIONAL TASK FORCE, THE OPENNESS DISPLAYED ABOUT GOVERNMENT FINANCES AND THE WELFARE PACKAGE INSTITUTED FOR STATES THAT COULDNT PAY SALARIES, THE TREASURY SINGLE ACCOUNT, WHICH WOULD PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNANCE, THE DISAPPEARED FUEL QUEUES, FAST-TRACKING OF THE CLEANUP OF OGONI LAND, REDUCTION IN THE COST OF GOVERNANCE, AND MANY OTHERS. BUT I WILL NOT FOCUS ON ALL THOSE. THE DAY COMETH! > WHEN A NEW SHERIFF COMES INTO TOWN, DISORDER GIVES WAY TO ORDER. CHAOS FLEES. IMPUNITY IS SWEPT AWAY. LAXITY GIVES WAY TO DILIGENCE, AND PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR OLD, UNEDIFYING WAYS. WHEN YOU HAVE A WILD, WILD WEST SITUATION PREVAILING, THE NEW SHERIFF COMES, AND STAMPS HIS AUTHORITY. OLD THINGS THEN PASS AWAY, BEHOLD, EVERYTHING BECOMES NEW. > NIGERIA HAD ALWAYS NEEDED ATTITUDINAL CHANGE. THAT WAS WHY THE BUHARI REGIME LAUNCHED WAR AGAINST INDISCIPLINE IN THE 1980S. AND THE WAR WAS SUCCEEDING, TILL A SPANNER WAS THROWN IN THE WORKS THROUGH REGIME CHANGE. BUHARI WAS CALLED ALL SORTS OF NAMES THEN: DESPOT, TYRANT, IRON FIST RULER ETC BUT THE DISCERNING KNEW. THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS A CHANGE WE NEEDED. AND THAT CHANGE WAS POSTPONED FOR 30 YEARS. > BUT WHAT IS BRED IN THE BONES NEVER GOES OUT THROUGH THE FLESH. IMMEDIATELY BUHARI RETURNED ON MAY 29, NIGERIANS KNEW THAT DISCIPLINE WAS BACK. THE BIRD OF THE HOMESTEAD TOLD THE ONES IN THE BUSH, AND THEY ALL SAT UP. NO UNNECESSARY CHIRPING. STEALING IS NOW CORRUPTION, THEY WHISPERED TO THEMSELVES. GOD HELP YOU IF YOU GET CAUGHT. > NOW, CONSIDER THE SITUATION WITH ELECTRICITY AND WITH OUR REFINERIES. ELECTRICITY HAS CLIMBED TO ABOUT 5,000 MEGAWATTS. SOME REFINERIES, WHICH HAD NOT PRODUCED A DROP OF FUEL FOR YEARS, HAVE CRACKED INTO LIFE. EVEN THE PERENNIAL QUEUES IN OUR PETROL STATIONS HAVE DISAPPEARED, VANISHED. IS IT BECAUSE BUHARI THREW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT THE PROBLEMS? NO. THOSE THINGS SIMPLY RESPONDED TO THE PRESENCE OF THE NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN. THOSE WHO MANNED THOSE SCHEDULES COULD AFFORD TO BE LAID BACK IN THE PAST. BUT NOT ANYMORE! THE MUSIC HAS CHANGED, AND THE DANCE STEPS MUST FOLLOW SUIT. AND WOULD BUHARI TAKE CREDIT FOR THE NEWFOUND ZEAL AND EFFICIENCY? NOT THE PLAIN AND HONEST MAN FROM DAURA. THE BROADCASTER OMOTAYO OMOTOSO HAD COME TO THE PRESIDENTIAL VILLA TO INTERVIEW HIM SOMETIME IN JULY. AND SHE HAD ASKED WHAT THE MAGIC WAND HE WAVED WAS, THAT REFINERIES, LONG COMATOSE, HAD SPRANG BACK TO LIFE. THE PRESIDENT RESPONDED THAT IT WOULD BE DISHONEST OF HIM TO HAVE CLAIMED HE DID ANYTHING. HE HAD NOT TOUCHED REFINERIES AT ALL. BUT UNKNOWN TO THE PRESIDENT, HE DID SOMETHING. HE HAD SWEPT INTO TOWN WITH HIS REPUTATION FOR EFFICIENCY, AND FOR ACHIEVING RESULTS. AND THE REFINERIES, FUEL SUPPLY, ELECTRICITY SUPPLY, RESPONDED TO THE NEW SHERIFF. MAY THINGS CONTINUE TO GET BETTER TILL THE CHANGE BECOMES ENDURING AND IRREVERSIBLE. AMEN SOMEBODY! > ANOTHER IMPERCEPTIBLE BUT MOMENTOUS ACHIEVEMENT IS THE FAITH THAT NIGERIANS NOW HAVE IN THEIR LEADER. YES, THE OPPOSITION NUMBERS IN MILLIONS, AND NATURALLY SO. A POLITICAL PARTY HAD HELD POWER AT THE CENTRE FOR 16 YEARS, AND ITS LOYALISTS WOULD NOT SIMPLY DISAPPEAR, OR GET CONVERTED OVERNIGHT. ABOUT 12 MILLION NIGERIANS HAD VOTED FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THAT PARTY IN THE MARCH 2015 GENERAL ELECTIONS. WOULD THEY JUST CROSS OVER TO THE WINNING SIDE? IT OFTEN TAKES AWHILE. BUT DESPITE ALL THAT, A GREAT DEAL OF NIGERIANS, A VAST MAJORITY, BELIEVE IN THE NEW SHERIFF. AND THAT IS GREAT ACHIEVEMENT. A BIG DEAL. WHEN THE CITIZENRY BELIEVE IN THEIR LEADER, AND ALMOST CAN SWEAR BY HIM, IT IS NO MEAN FEAT. THE NOI POLLS, IN A SURVEY IN JULY, REVEALED THAT OVER 70% OF NIGERIANS WERE HAPPY WITH THE BUHARI ADMINISTRATION. AND I CAN BET THAT THE PERCENTAGE WOULD RISE, AS THE MONTHS AND YEARS ROLL BY. FAITH IN LEADERSHIP IS SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT COME CHEAP. > AND THIS ONE! EVEN OUR FOREIGN RESERVE KNOWS THAT A NEW SHERIFF IS IN TOWN, AND HAS RESPONDED APPROPRIATELY. IN JUNE, JUST ONE MONTH INTO OFFICE, AND WITH THE PLUGGING OF SOME LEAKAGES AND LOOPHOLES, FOREIGN RESERVE SURGED FROM $29 BILLION TO $31.89. HOLY MOSES! JUST IN ONE MONTH. WELL, THAT IS WHAT A NEW SHERIFF CAN DO. HE BRINGS SANITY, CONFIDENCE AND PROBITY TO THE SYSTEM. AND YOU WOULD AGREE THAT NIGERIA NEEDS SUCH SHOT IN THE ARM, IF WE CONSIDER RECENT PAST EXPERIENCES, WHEN OUR TREASURY WAS LIKE A BAG FILLED WITH HOLES. > AN EVIDENCE OF THE BELIEVABILITY OF THE NEW SHERIFF, AND THE CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM, IS THE DISCLOSURE THAT CAME THIS WEEK FROM AMBASSADOR GODKNOWS IGALI, PERMANENT SECRETARY, MINISTRY OF POWER. HE SAID SINCE BUHARI CAME TO OFFICE, NOT A SINGLE SABOTAGE OF THE POWER INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN RECORDED, AND IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT ELECTRICITY SUPPLY KEEPS IMPROVING. BUT DID BUHARI LINE UP SOLDIERS ACROSS THE POWER INFRASTRUCTURE? DID HE HIRE A COMBINATION OF OPC, EGBESU, MASSOB, MEND AND AREWA YOUTHS TO KEEP VIGIL? NO. JUST BELIEVABILITY. THOSE WHO ARE SO ANGRY WITH THE COUNTRY, AND WOULD GO TO ANY EXTENT TO SABOTAGE DEVELOPMENT, HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE THE SHERIFF A CHANCE. THEY HAVE HEARD OF HIS REPUTATION. A MAN THAT BELIEVES IN FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE. HE WOULD DO RIGHT TO ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. > CAN YOU IMAGINE THE RESPECT OUR SHERIFF COMMANDS ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE, AND HOW IT REDOUNDS TO THE GLORY OF THE AVERAGE NIGERIAN? AMERICAN PRESIDENT, BARACK OBAMA SAID BUHARI CAME ONTO HIS JOB WITH REPUTATION OF INTEGRITY AND A CLEARCUT AGENDA. AMBASSADOR JOHNNY CARSON, ALSO DURING THE U.S TRIP IN JULY, SAID THE NIGERIAN PRESIDENT WAS A MAN OF HONOUR AND INTEGRITY. EVERYWHERE HE GOES, THE NIGERIAN PRESIDENT IS LAUDED AND GARLANDED FOR HIS VIRTUES. AND THE IMAGE OF THE COUNTRY IS BURNISHED AND REPOSITIONED IN THE PROCESS. SURELY, GREATER DAYS ARE AHEAD. > SOME PEOPLE SAY THE SHERIFF DID NOT HIT THE GROUND RUNNING, AS HE IS YET TO CONSTITUTE HIS CABINET IN 100 DAYS. AND I USUALLY ASK SUCH PEOPLE: WHEN YOU HIT THE GROUND, AND YOU LAND IN MUD, HOW DO YOU BEGIN TO RUN IMMEDIATELY? YOU CAN ONLY SINK DEEPER, IF YOU ATTEMPT TO RUN. THE THING TO DO IS TO FIRST CLEAR THE MUD, TILL YOU GET TO TERRA FIRMA, AND THEN YOU CAN BEGIN TO RUN. > PRESIDENT BUHARI HAS SPENT TIME TRYING TO CLEAN THE AUGEAN STABLE HE INHERITED. AND HE IS SUCCEEDING. SHERIFFS CAN EITHER COME IN WITH GUNS BLAZING, SHOOTING MALEFACTORS TO KINGDOM COME, OR SIMPLY STAMP THEIR AUTHORITY ON THE SITUATION BY SHEER FORCE OF PERSONALITY AND PRESENCE. THE NIGERIAN SHERIFF SEEMS TO HAVE OPTED FOR THE SECOND OPTION FOR NOW. BUT WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET THAT SHERIFFS ARE LICENSED TO SHOOT. AND THOSE SHOTS CAN BE LETHAL FOR LAWBREAKERS. IN A MATTER OF MONTHS, YOU CAN ASK THOSE WHO HAD BLED OUR TREASURY TO THE POINT OF DEATH. THEYLL HAVE STORIES TO TELL.

356	LAST POST IN THIS THREAD I MENTIONED THAT I HAD OBTAINED SOME 'HONDURAN' MAHOGANY FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD ON THE CABINET. I WASN'T ENTIRELY PLEASED WITH THE MATERIAL I RECEIVED AS I HAD WANTED QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY, WHILE 7 OUT OF THE 10 BOARDS RECEIVED WERE NOT FITTING THAT DESCRIPTION AT ALL. I REALIZE NOW THAT QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY IS NOT GENERALLY WHAT WAS BEING CUT - LOGS ARE INVARIABLY SAWN THROUGH AND THROUGH - AND THUS QS STOCK IS LESS COMMONLY AVAILABLE THAN I HAD THOUGHT. SO, TRYING TO OBTAIN MORE (IN BULK) IN THE HOPE OF SCORING SOME MORE QUARTERSAWN BOARDS WAS NOT LOOKING PROMISING. NONE OF THE RETAILERS I SPOKE WITH SEEMED EVEN WILLING TO DO A SORT FOR A FEW BOARDS, AND FAIR ENOUGH. AFTER FURTHER RUMINATION, I DECIDED IT WOULD BE BEST TO CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SPECIES FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD, A SPECIES THAT WAS TYPICALLY CUT FOR QUARTERSAWN FROM THE GET-GO AND WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD MATCH FOR THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE REST OF THE CABINET. I'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED WOODS SUCH AS MAHOGANY, BLACK CHERRY, AND SWISS PEAR WOOD FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD. NONE OF THOSE WERE LIKELY TO FIT THE REQUIREMENTS I HAD IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION, SO I KEPT LOOKING. I FINALLY CAME ACROSS A SUITABLE MATERIAL, AND IT IS BOTANICALLY RELATED TO BUBINGA (WHICH IS GUIBORTIA TESSMANII OR GUIBORTIA PELLAGRINIANA OR GUIBORTIA DEMEUSEI). THIS IS A WOOD CALLED SHEDUA, AKA OVANGKOL, WHICH COMES FROM THE SPECIES GUIBORTIA EHIE. THIS IS A SOMEWHAT SMALLER TREE THAN THOSE SPECIES FROM WHICH BUBINGA IS OBTAINED, HOWEVER IN MANY RESPECTS SHEDUA SHARES THE SAME WORKING QUALITIES AS BUBINGA. THE WOOD COMES FROM WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES LIKE GABON AND CAMEROON, AND THE TREE IS MORE COMMONLY UTILIZED FOR ITS GUM RESIN, CALLED CONGO COPAL, THAN ITS TIMBER. THE TIMBER IS NOT VERY COMMONLY AVAILABLE, AND DOES SEEM TO FIND A CERTAIN FAVOR AMONG THE GUITAR-MAKING COMMUNITY. HERE'S A GUITAR WITH A SHEDUA BACK: (FROM:HTTP://WWW.GUITARBENCH.COM/2012/01/04/SHEDUA-TONEWOOD-PROFILE/) AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS A MORE BROWNISH CAST THAN BUBINGA, BUT SHARES THE BLACK STREAKS. COMPARING SHEDUA'S MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WITH BUBINGA, IT IS VERY CLOSE INDEED, BEING VERY SLIGHTLY LIGHTER AND DENSER, A LITTLE LOWER IN VOLUMETRIC CHANGE DUE TO MOISTURE CONTENT CHANGE, A SLIGHT BIT SOFTER IN TERMS OF CRUSHING STRENGTH AND A HAIR STIFFER IN BENDING STRENGTH (MODULUS OF ELASTICITY). I IMAGINE, THEREFORE, THAT IT SHOULD HAVE FAIRLY SIMILAR WORKING QUALITIES TO BUBINGA. THIS IMAGE FROM HEARNE HARDWOODS SHOWS THE VARIED APPEARANCE OF SHEDUA BASED ON THE GRAIN ORIENTATION: AS IT SO HAPPENS, HEARNE WAS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THE US WHICH HAD ANY STOCK OF SHEDUA AT ALL, LET ALONE QS AND/OR FIGURED STOCK. IN FACT, THEY HAD A DECENTLY SIZED STACK OF 12/4 MATERIAL, 6~12" WIDE, 16' LONG OR LONGER, AND SOME OF IT WAS QUARTERSAWN. CONSIDERING FEW OTHER RETAILERS HAVE ANY OF THIS MATERIAL, IT WAS AMAZING TO COME ACROSS SUCH NICE STOCK. THEY ALSO TOOK TIME TO REPLY TO MY EMAILS, AND SEND PICTURES, ONCE I HAD DEMONSTRATED SOLID INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL - - AND HAD GIVEN THEM MY CREDIT CARD INFO! THEY SEEM TO BE A WOOD RETAILER SPECIALIZING IN HIGH QUALITY AND RARE MATERIALS. THEY SENT ME SOME PICTURES OF A COUPLE OF BOARDS WHICH MATCHED THE REQUIREMENTS I GAVE THEM, SWABBED WITH ALCOHOL TO MAKE THE FIGURE A BIT CLEARER THOUGH NOT SHOWING THE TONE WHICH WILL BE OBTAINED WITH A PROPER FINISH: THEY WERE WONDERING IF I WAS SO DETERMINED TO HAVE QUARTERSAWN BECAUSE I WAS A LUTHIER, HOWEVER I LET THEM KNOW THEY WERE GUESSING WRONG. I DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC REASONS FOR WANTING QUARTERSAWN MATERIAL OF COURSE. THE GUY WHO SENT ME THE PICTURES STATED THAT THESE TWO BOARDS MIGHT BE THE NICEST IN THE ENTIRE PILE. I ASKED FOR A FOLLOW-UP PIC OF THE END GRAIN OF THE TWO BOARDS, TO CONFIRM THEY WERE WHAT I WANTED IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION: AND THE OTHER BOARD, ABOUT 12" WIDE: THE STICKS ARE HARD TO SCALE UNTIL YOU NOTICE THAT A FORKLIFT IS DOING THE LIFTING.... THE STOCK LOOKED GOOD TO ME. THE PRICE WAS STEEP, AT $35/BOARD FOOT, SO EACH OF THOSE BOARDS WAS $1400.00, HOWEVER I WAS ABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE COST SOMEWHAT BY SELLING A PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY-ACQUIRED MAHOGANY OFF TO ANOTHER WOODWORKER IN MY BUILDING. I ORDERED THOSE TWO BOARDS AND THEY SHOULD BE AT MY SHOP IN ANOTHER 3~4 DAYS. I THINK THIS WOOD WILL GO VERY NICELY WITH THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE BULK OF THE CABINET: I THINK THE CAD REPRESENTATION OF THE SHEDUA IS APPROXIMATE AT BEST. IN RECENT DAYS I HAVE REVISED THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DIVIDERS ON THE LOWER BANK OF DRAWERS, MAKING THEM STRAIGHT INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM MATCH THE DRAWER CURVES, AND RECESSING THEM BACK SLIGHTLY - THIS FOR AMONG OTHER REASONS, TO INCREASE THE SHADOW LINE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE CURVED DRAWERS AND THE SURROUNDING FRAMEWORK: THE DIVIDER'S OUTER ARRISES WILL ADDITIONALLY BE CHAMFERED. THE DRAWERS THEMSELVES WILL HAVE A BEADED PERIMETER DETAIL, AND HAVE THE DRAWER SIDEWALL THROUGH- TENONS POKING OUT, NEITHER OF WHICH IS NOT ILLUSTRATED YET, AND THE HANDLE DESIGN FOR THE DRAWERS REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION. LIKEWISE, THE UPPER SET OF DRAWERS AND DOORS REMAINS JUST A FRONTAL PLANE AT THE MOMENT WITH NO ALLOWANCE FOR SET BACK, CHAMFERING, ETC.. GETTING THERE! THANKS FOR VISITING THE CARPENTRY WAY. GOT SOME MACHINE'S COMING SOON SO I AM WORKING ON GETTING MY SHOP READY FOR THAT - THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE SUBJECT OF THE NEXT POST.
357	SANTA CLARA, CA -- (MARKETWIRED) -- 09/10/15 -- OOYALA , A TELSTRA SUBSIDIARY AND A LEADING INNOVATOR IN PREMIUM VIDEO PUBLISHING, ANALYTICS AND MONETIZATION, REVEALED DATA DEMONSTRATING SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE GROWTH ACROSS AN ARRAY OF BROADCASTERS AND PUBLISHERS USING ITS PROGRAMMATIC TRADING PLATFORM, OOYALA PULSE SSP. FROM THE BEGINNING OF MARCH 2015 THROUGH JUNE 2015, A SET OF MORE THAN 40 PLUS BROADCASTERS AND PUBLISHERS ACROSS EUROPE SAW THEIR EFFECTIVE COST PER THOUSAND IMPRESSIONS (ECPMS) INCREASE MORE THAN 25 PERCENT. FURTHER, DURING THIS TIME THEIR COLLECTIVE PROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING REVENUE GREW 119 PERCENT. THE GROWTH IS NOTABLE AS EUROPEAN PREMIUM CONTENT PROVIDERS SHIFT THEIR PROGRAMMATIC TRADING STRATEGIES FROM OPEN TO PRIVATE MARKETPLACES OR PROGRAMMATIC DIRECT TRANSACTIONS WITH GREATER YIELD FOR PREMIUM VIDEO INVENTORY. THIS MOMENTUM REFLECTS OOYALA PULSE SSP RESULTS FROM JUST ONE YEAR IN THE EUROPEAN MARKET, WHERE OOYALA IS USED BY MORE THAN HALF OF THE REGIONS BROADCASTERS. THE STRONG GROWTH DEMONSTRATES LARGE BRANDS AND ADVERTISERS COMFORT WITH THE PURCHASE OF PREMIUM VIDEO INVENTORY THROUGH PRIVATE PROGRAMMATIC SETTINGS. THE Q1 2015 RTB REPORT FROM ADFORM SHOWS THAT PRIVATE MARKETPLACES ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY 25 PERCENT OF ALL EUROPEAN ADVERTISING IN Q1 2015 WITH EXPECTATIONS OF THAT GROWING SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE COMING MONTHS. THE TREND EXTENDS BEYOND EUROPE; EMARKETER EXPECTS PROGRAMMATIC DIRECT DEALS TO REACH $8.57 BILLION IN THE U.S., REPRESENTING 42 PERCENT OF ALL PROGRAMMATIC AD SPEND BY 2016. "DISTRIBUTING IN THE PRIVATE, PROGRAMMATIC MARKETPLACE GIVES US AN ADVANTAGE WHEN CONSIDERING OUR VIDEO LIBRARY, OUR OFFERINGS AND THE VOLUME OF INVENTORY AVAILABLE TODAY. AS BUSINESS WITH ADVERTISERS LOOKING TO MAKE PROGRAMMATIC BUYS CONTINUES TO GROW, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MEET THE DEMAND," SAID HASSAN ALI KHAN, SVP MARKETING OF ONION, INC. "FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, OOYALA CAN HELP US MEET THIS DEMAND, WHILE THEIR YIELD MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL HELP OPTIMIZE THE PROCESS TO EFFICIENTLY CONNECT THE RIGHT PARTNER AT THE RIGHT PRICE POINT." ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS INCREASED CONFIDENCE IS THE TRENDING UPTICK IN DEAL ID-BASED TRANSACTIONS, WHICH ALLOW FOR ONE-TO-ONE DEALS IN A PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENT. THESE TRANSACTIONS GREW AT A MONTHLY RATE OF 79 PERCENT IN Q1 2015, AND IN Q2 DEAL IDS GREW MORE THAN TWO TIMES THAT RATE AT 176 PERCENT. ALSO IN JUNE 2015, ECPMS FROM PROGRAMMATIC DIRECT DEALS WERE MORE THAN DOUBLE THOSE TRADED VIA MARKETPLACES. NOT ONLY ARE PREMIUM CONTENT PROVIDERS SEEING GREATER VALUE IN QUALITY BY GOING DIRECT WITH PROGRAMMATIC TRADING, BUT ARE INCREASING THEIR REVENUE SIGNIFICANTLY. "WITH OOYALA WE'VE SEEN OUR PROGRAMMATIC BOTTOM LINE INCREASE MONTH-OVER-MONTH," SAYS TOM ELLINGSEN, COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR OF VGTV. "WE FIND OUR AD BUYERS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH BUYING DIRECTLY FROM US AS THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE BUYING AND THE AUDIENCES WE REACH, MAKING RESULTS AND REPORTING VERY TRANSPARENT." "TRADING OUR INVENTORY IN PRIVATE PROGRAMMATIC SETTINGS PROVES TO BE INCREDIBLY IMPACTFUL TO OUR BUSINESS AS THE DEMAND AND WILLINGNESS TO PURCHASE OUR PREMIUM INVENTORY IS HIGH FROM OUR ADVERTISERS," SAID DILEM GLER, DIGITAL DIRECTOR OF EXPRESSEN, A LEADING SWEDISH NATIONAL NEWSPAPER. "AS OUR ECPMS CONTINUE TO RISE AND INVENTORY SELLS OUT, WE SHIFT MORE AND MORE OF OUR TIER ONE CONTENT TO PROGRAMMATIC TRADING WITH NO LOSS IN REVENUE, AND IN MANY CASES AT A GAIN." "WE SEE EUROPE AS THE LEADING ADOPTER FOR PREMIUM, PROGRAMMATIC DIRECT TRADING," SAID MARIA FLORES, VICE PRESIDENT, PROGRAMMATIC SALES OF OOYALA. "OPEN MARKETPLACES ARE DYING AS THE INDUSTRY MIGRATES TO EXCLUSIVE TRADING ENVIRONMENTS. THIS IS DUE TO PREMIUM CONTENT OWNERS SEEING THE DIRECT IMPACT PROGRAMMATIC TRADING HAS ON THEIR BOTTOM LINE, AND IN THEIR ABILITY TO PUT IN PLACE THE CONTROL AND TRANSPARENCY THAT THEY AND THEIR ADVERTISERS DEMAND." ABOUT OOYALA: OOYALA HELPS DELIVER CONTENT THAT CONNECTS. A US-BASED SUBSIDIARY OF GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND IT SERVICES COMPANY TELSTRA, OOYALA'S COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF OFFERINGS INCLUDES ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST PREMIUM VIDEO PLATFORMS AND A LEADING AD SERVING SOLUTION.

359	MT. PLEASANT NEWS WINFIELD ZONING IS ALIVE AND WELL IN WINFIELD FOLLOWING ACTION BY THE CITY COUNCIL THURSDAY NIGHT. MEETING IN SPECIAL SESSION, THE COUNCIL APPOINTED FIVE LOCAL CITIZENS TO THE CITYS BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT/PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION. THE APPOINTEES INCLUDE LINDA SHARP, PAUL BEATY, TOM RODRUCK, JERRY FRICKE AND CHRIS FINNELL. FINNELL, WHO ALSO SERVES AS WINFIELD MAYOR, DID NOT SEE SERVING ON THE BOARD AND COMMISSION AS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. I AM THE MAYOR, BUT TECHNICALLY I AM NOT ON THE COUNCIL, I DO NOT HAVE A VOTE (ON COUNCIL). IF THIS DOESNT FLY, WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER MEETING, FINNELL SAID. COUNCIL MEMBER JAN WALTER SAID SHE DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FINNELL SERVING ON THE BOARD AND COMMISSION. WE CAN APPROVE IT AND IF IT IS A PROBLEM, WE CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE. THE COUNCILS ACTION THURSDAY NIGHT RESULTED FROM A DISCUSSION WITH JOE BUFFINGTON, HENRY COUNTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING AND ZONING, DURING THE COUNCILS REGULAR MONTHLY MEETING ON SEPT. 14. BUFFINGTON TOLD THE COUNCIL THAT WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT, IT PUTS THE COMMUNITY IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION REGARDING ZONING. YOU DONT HAVE THE TOOLS IN PLACE (WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT) TO HAVE ZONING, PERIOD, BUFFINGTON TOLD THE COUNCIL AT ITS PREVIOUS MEETING. YOU DONT HAVE A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT SO THERE IS NO DUE PROCESS. IF YOU HAVE CHALLENGES (TO ZONING ORDINANCES), IT COULD BE A MESS BECAUSE YOU LOST YOUR ABILITY TO ZONE WITHOUT A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. IN ORDER TO HAVE ZONING, YOU MUST HAVE A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. THE CITY, BUFFINGTON SAID, COULD HAVE THE SAME CITIZENS ON BOTH THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT AND PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION. A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT IS COMPRISED OF FIVE MEMBERS AND HANDLES ZONING AND VARIANCE MATTERS. WALTER, WHO SERVED AS CITY CLERK FOR THREE DECADES SAID THE COMMUNITY HASNT HAD A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT FOR AT LEAST A DECADE. SHE SAID THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE LACK OF A BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT WAS FINDING PEOPLE WILLING TO SERVE ON THE BOARD. IN THE ONLY OTHER AGENDA MATTER, THE COUNCIL SET A 4 P.M. HEARING MONDAY, OCT. 12, FOR THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT TO CONSIDER A VARIANCE FOR THE WINFIELD HEALTH CARE AND RETIREMENT CENTER. THE COUNCILS NEXT MEETING WILL ALSO BE ON MONDAY, OCT. 12, AT 7 P.M. IN CITY HALL.
360	THERE'S A RESIDENT EVIL IN HARLEM. AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE ZOMBIES . IT WAS EARLY AFTERNOON WHEN THE MAN WITH THE TWITCHING LEGS WAS DRAGGED FROM THE GROUND INTO AN AMBULANCE. ANOTHER MAN SELLING BOOKS WASHED AWAY THE VOMIT. A MAN NAMED CHARLIE MEDINA SAT AT THE SAME SPOT A FEW DAYS LATER, UNABLE TO REMEMBER HIS NAME BEFORE HE FELL INTO A TRANCE WITH HIS JAW OPEN AND HIS EYES DILATED. AND THE LOVERS. THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND A ROOM. ONE PULLED OFF THE OTHERS SHIRT AND HER BRA, THEN STARTED TO KISS HER BRUISED BREASTS WHILE A SMALL CROWD GATHERED TO WATCH. THE PEOPLE HERE ON THIS STRETCH OF 125TH STREET IN EAST HARLEM MAY CHANGE, BUT THE DRUG REMAINS THE SAME: K2 , ALSO CALLED SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA, A POTENT MIX OF HERBS AND CHEMICALS THAT HAS BECOME WIDELY USED AMONG HOMELESS PEOPLE IN NEW YORK CITY. CROWDS OF UP TO 80 OR 100 HOMELESS PEOPLE COME IN ON BUSES FROM A NEARBY SHELTER ON RANDALLS ISLAND, DRAWN BY HEROIN RECOVERY CLINICS NEARBY, AND SPEND THE DAY THERE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS CHEAPER NARCOTIC. THE BLOCK BETWEEN PARK AND LEXINGTON AVENUES APPEARS AT TIMES TO BE A STREET OF ZOMBIES. THE ZOMBIES ARE JUST A SYMPTOM OF THE PROBLEM. THE RESIDENT EVIL I WAS REFERREDTO ABOVE IS THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY, WHICH REFUSES TO CLEAR THESE ADDICTS OFF THE STREETS. THIS ISN'T THE KIND OF CRIME THAT REQUIRES FANCY DETECTIVE WORK TO SOLVE; THESE PEOPLE ARE SO OUT IN THE OPEN, LYING ON BUSY STREETS, THAT THEY CAN'T BE AVOIDED. THE REASON THEY ARE THERE IS BECAUSE OF LAX LAWS ABOUT HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS, LAX LAWS FOR DRUG ADDICTS (I BELIEVE LIBERALS AND RAND PAUL CALL IT "DECRIMINALIZING LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS"), AND A LACK OF WILL ON THE PART OF THE POLICE TO KEEP THE STREETS SAFE AND CLEAR. AND THE LACK OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE POLICE COMES FROM THE TOP, FROM COMMISSAR DE BLASIO. IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS HARLEM HAS BECOME A TRENDY PLACE TO LIVE FOR WHITE LIBERALS, WHO WOULD SPEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR BROWNSTONES IN DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOODS. ON THE UPSIDE, THE PRICE OF DRUGS AND PROSTITUTES ARE PROBABLY CHEAPER THERE. I ALSO KNOW THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS AN OFFICE THERE.

361	REVISION. THERE ARE MANY TRAINING METHODS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYEE WITHIN A GOVERNMENT AGENCY: ONLINE COURSEWARE; VIRTUAL CLASSROOM; IN-PERSON, TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT; OR A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE.  "IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION TWO PROJECTS MAKE, THEY REPRESENT ABOUT $200 MILLION. WHATEVER THE CHOICE, AN ORGANIZATIONS FUTURE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES SHOULD BE THE TRAINING MISSION, WITH THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL FRONT AND CENTER. IDEALLY, AN EMPLOYEES DEVELOPMENT PLAN WOULD MESH WITH THE AGENCYS VISION AND ITS OPERATIONAL NECESSITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INDIVIDUALS CAREER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. A ROBUST AND WELL-DESIGNED TRAINING PROGRAM THAT CONSIDERS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND TALENT GAPS IS ALSO AN EFFECTIVE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL. CASE IN POINT AS A COLLEGE GRADUATE, I ENTERED A SOPHISTICATED ARMY CIVILIAN TRAINING PROGRAM IN WHAT HAS NOW EVOLVED INTO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT.  THE COMPANY OWNS 51.6% CONTROLLING INTEREST IN MIDCOAST OPERATING, L.P. THAT PROGRAM INCLUDED MANDATORY CLASSES, FUNCTIONAL HUMAN RESOURCES TRAINING, AND A TWO-YEAR ROTATIONAL ASSIGNMENT WITH A MANDATORY GEOGRAPHIC MOVE. FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE, I DID NOT KNOW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF WORKING IN A FEDERAL ORGANIZATION, BUT THE TRAINING PROGRAM GAVE ME THE FOUNDATIONAL EDUCATION I NEEDED TO BOTH PERFORM MY JOB WELL AND ADVANCE MY FUTURE CAREER. INDEED, IT HELPED ME BECOME THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE WHO WAS AN ASSET TO MY ORGANIZATIONS FUTURE. MATCHING METHOD TO GOALS AS FAR AS SPECIFIC LEARNING METHODS GO, NONE STAND OUT AS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS, LEARNING STYLES, AND ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN DECIDING WHICH EDUCATIONAL TOOLS WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES. FOR INSTANCE, TOTAL IMMERSION MAY NOT ALWAYS GIVE THE BEST RESULT, AS SOME EMPLOYEES MAY BE APT TO LEARN IN A HANDS-ON ENVIRONMENT OR THROUGH SMALLER BURSTS OF INFORMATION. MEANWHILE, THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT  HAS PROVEN TO BE AN INVALUABLE AND HIGHLY EFFEQCTIVE NETWORKING TOOL. CONSEQUENTLY, SPENDING TIME LEARNING WITH PEERS IN AN EMPLOYEES SAME DISCIPLINE OR AREA OF INTEREST CAN RESULT IN LASTING SUPPORT AND SYNERGY THAT  ENDURES THROUGHOUT AND BEYOND FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT. CLASSROOM INSTRUCTORS CAN ALSO SERVE AS VALUABLE RESOURCES FOR THE FUTURE. HOW ARE YOU DESIGNING YOUR TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MEET FUTURE AGENCY GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS?

362	THE WITHDRAWAL CAME SIX WEEKS AFTER THE FINAL U.S. CLEARANCE AND THREE MONTHS AFTER SHELL WAS STILL DEFENDING THE PROJECT, A RAPID CHANGE OF HEART FOR SUCH A LARGE COMPANY THAT SHOWED IT IS PREPARING FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF LOW OIL PRICES WHILE TRYING TO CLOSE ITS $70 BILLION TAKEOVER OF RIVAL BG. SHELL HAS SPENT ABOUT $7 BILLION ON EXPLORATION IN THE WATERS OFF ALASKA SO FAR AND SAID IT COULD TAKE A HIT OF UP TO $4.1 BILLION FOR PULLING OUT OF THE TREACHEROUS CHUKCHI SEA, WHERE ICEBERGS CAN BE AS LARGE AS NEW YORK'S MANHATTAN ISLAND. THE UNSUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN IS SHELL'S SECOND MAJOR SETBACK IN THE ARCTIC AFTER IT INTERRUPTED EXPLORATION FOR THREE YEARS IN 2012 WHEN AN ENORMOUS DRILLING RIG BROKE FREE AND RAN AGROUND. ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNERS AND SHAREHOLDERS HAVE ALSO PRESSURED SHELL TO DROP ARCTIC DRILLING. SOME ARE WORRIED AN OIL SPILL WOULD HARM PROTECTED SPECIES WHILE OTHERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST AFTER OIL PRICES MORE THAN HALVED IN A YEAR. SHELL SAID THE DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE AREA REFLECTED POOR RESULTS FROM ITS BURGER J EXPLORATORY WELL, THE PROJECT'S HIGH COSTS AND THE UNPREDICTABLE FEDERAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN THE AREA OFF THE U.S. STATE OF ALASKA. A SHELL SOURCE SAID THE COMPANY HAD FOUND U.S. REGULATION VERY PRESCRIPTIVE AND IN SOME CASES CONTRADICTORY, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THE REGULATORY PROCESS. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION DEALT A BLOW TO SHELL IN JUNE, RULING THAT LAWS PROTECTING WALRUS AND POLAR BEARS PREVENTED SHELL FROM DRILLING TWO RIGS SIMULTANEOUSLY AT CLOSE RANGE. "THE ENTIRE EPISODE HAS BEEN A VERY COSTLY ERROR FOR THE COMPANY BOTH FINANCIALLY AND REPUTATIONALLY," SAID ANALYSTS AT DEUTSCHE BANK, WHO ESTIMATE THE SHELL'S ARCTIC EXPLORATION PROJECT COULD COST THE COMPANY ABOUT $9 BILLION. ARCTIC CASUALTIES ENVIRONMENTALISTS, WHO HAVE CRITICIZED SHELL'S DRILLING PLANS IN AN AREA THAT IS HOME TO POPULATIONS OF WHALES, WALRUS AND POLAR BEARS, CLAIMED VICTORY. IN JULY, ACTIVISTS TRIED TO STOP AN ICEBREAKER KEY TO SHELL'S DRILLING PLANS FROM LEAVING PORT BY DANGLING FROM A BRIDGE. ANNIE LEONARD, HEAD OF GREENPEACE USA, SAID SHELL'S DECISION WAS "PROOF POSITIVE THAT DRILLING IN THE ARCTIC IS TOO COSTLY TO BE EFFECTIVE AND A BAD BET FOR OTHER ENERGY COMPANIES." THE DECISION IS ALSO THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF SETBACKS FOR PROJECTS IN THE ARCTIC TO FIND OIL AND GAS DEPOSITS ESTIMATED AT 20 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S UNDISCOVERED RESOURCES. EARLIER THIS YEAR, NORWAY'S STATOIL POSTPONED ITS ARCTIC JOHAN CASTBERG PROJECT AGAIN AND IN 2012 RUSSIA'S GAZPROM, TOGETHER WITH TOTAL AND STATOIL, SCRAPPED THE SHTOKMAN GAS PROJECT IN THE ARCTIC BARENTS SEA. "ARCTIC EXPLORATION HAS BEEN A CLEAR CASUALTY OF THE OIL PRICE SLUMP," SAID PETER KIERNAN, OIL AND GAS ANALYST AT THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT. OIL FIRMS HAVE DROPPED COSTLY OFFSHORE PROJECTS WORLDWIDE AS WEAK OIL PRICES HAVE EATEN INTO BUDGETS. THESE INCLUDE BP'S DECISION TO REVIEW INVESTMENT PLANS FOR THE DEEPWATER MAD DOG 2 PROJECT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND HUSKY ENERGY'S DELAY TO AN EXTENSION OF ITS WEST WHITE ROSE FIELD OFF CANADA. "ALASKA BEEN A BONE OF CONTENTION FOR MANY INVESTORS THUS TODAY'S UPDATE IS A POSITIVE," SAID BERNSTEIN ANALYSTS, WHO RATE SHELL'S STOCK AS OUTPERFORM. SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI, AN ALASKAN REPUBLICAN, SAID SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED BY THE DECISION. THE U.S. INTERIOR DEPARTMENT "PLACED SIGNIFICANT LIMITS ON THIS SEASON'S ACTIVITIES, WHICH RESULTED IN A DRILLING RIG SITTING IDLE," SHE SAID. SHELL'S LONDON-LISTED SHARES MOVED UP IN EARLY TRADING BUT LATER FELL MORE THAN 2.8 PERCENT. SHELL SAID ITS ALASKAN PROJECT WAS VALUED AT ABOUT $3 BILLION ON ITS BALANCE SHEET AND THAT IT HAD A $1.1 BILLION IN FUTURE CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS. IT SAID IT WOULD GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE COST OF WRITEDOWNS WITH THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS.

THAT GAME SAW UNITED SURRENDER A 1-0 LEAD BEFORE EVENTUALLY BEING BEATEN 2-1, BUT IT WILL PERHAPS BE MORE REMEMBERED FOR THE HORROR TACKLE THAT LEFT LUKE SHAW WITH A DOUBLE FRACTURE OF HIS LEG - AND OUT FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME.  THEIR RECENT STRING OF VICTORIES HAS LED TO UNITED MIDFIELDER BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER ADMITTING THE CLUB HAVE THE STRENGTH TO WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE ALTHOUGH THEIR OPPOSITION ON WEDNESDAY WON'T BE EASY TO BEAT . WOLFSBURG SIT IN FOURTH PLACE IN THE BUNDESLIGA STANDINGS, BUT SUFFERED AN EMBARRASSING 5-1 THRASHING AT THE HANDS OF BAYERN MUNICH LAST WEEK, WHICH SAW ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI SCORE FIVE GOALS IN NINE SECOND-HALF MINUTES TO STUN THE VISITORS AT THE ALLIANZ ARENA. HOWEVER, WOLFSBURG COACH DIETER HECKING INSISTED ON TUESDAY HE ISNT WORRIED BY THE PROSPECT OF COMING TO OLD TRAFFORD AND TRYING TO SECURE A RESULT ALTHOUGH HE CONCEDED IT WILL NOT BE EASY. BUT WHO WILL COME OUT ON TOP? STAY TUNED TO STANDARD SPORT FOR ALL THE ACTION! PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT FOR THE LIVE BLOG TO LOAD WHAT THEY SAID VAN GAAL "I HAVE TO CONSIDER IF I WANT TO USE THESE PLAYERS," HETOLD MUTV. "WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PLAYERS BECAUSE WE ARE PLAYING THREE MATCHES EVERY WEEK. "IT'S THE ACCUMULATION OF TIREDNESS - WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT. I HAVE TO CONSIDER EVERY WEEK IF I CAN USE A PLAYER OR NOT. NOW HERRERA, CARRICK AND VALENCIA HAVE MINOR ISSUES. WE HAVE TO TAKE A DECISION AND I WILL TAKE THAT, MORE OR LESS, ON WEDNESDAY."
364	WARNING: THIS FOOTAGE IS LIKELY TO MAKE YOU FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. A CLIP OF JOHN LENNON PERFORMING WITH THE BEATLES, WHICH AIRED ON CHANNEL 4 OVER THE WEEKEND, QUITE CLEARLY SHOWS HIM MOCKING DISABLED PEOPLE. DURING A PERFORMANCE ON TV SHOW IT WAS ALRIGHT IN THE 1960S, JOHN CAN BE SEEN ONSTAGE WITH HIS ICONIC BAND. PAUL MCCARTNEY CAN BE HEARD SAYING "ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS CLAP YOUR HANDS" AS HE ENCOURAGES THE AUDIENCE TO JOIN IN. COPYING HIM, LENNON THEN SAYS "CLAP YOUR HANDS" WHILE PUSHING HIS TONGUE TO THE SIDE OF HIS MOUTH TO ADOPT A FALSE SPEECH IMPEDIMENT. HE THEN BEGINS AN EXAGGERATED CLAP, BEFORE STAMPING HIS FEET ON THE FLOOR WHILE MIMICKING SOMEONE WITH LEARNING DIFFICULTIES. YT SHOCKING: JOHN LENNON MOCKED DISABLED PEOPLE ONSTAGE THE DISTURBING CHARADE IS SOMEWHAT BIZARRE AND APPEARS TO HAVE NO POINT WHATSOEVER TO THE PERFORMANCE. SOME FANS TOOK TO TWITTER TO ARGUE THAT HE IS SIMPLY A COMEDIAN PUTTING ON A SHOW, BUT MANY WERE DISAPPOINTED BY THE "SHOCKING" ACT. ONE SOCIAL NETWORKER ARGUED: "I DON'T THINK JOHN LENNON WAS MOCKING DISABLED PEOPLE I THINK HE WAS MOCKING HIS LEGIONS OF RETARDS THAT WORSHIP HIM FOR NO REASON." WHILE ANOTHER AGREED: "#ITWASALRIGHTINTHE1960S ANYBODY WHO'S READ A BIT ABOUT THE BEATLES KNOWS THAT 'SAINT' JOHN LENNON HAD A CRUEL 'HUMOUR' ABOUT DISABLED PEOPLE." YET AN APPALLED TWEETER WROTE: "JOHN LENNON WAS ABUSIVE AND HOMOPHOBIC/RACIST. HE WASN'T A GOOD PERSON. HE WASN'T 'SLIGHTLY PROBLEMATIC', HE WAS DISGUSTING." WITH ANOTHER ADDING: "THAT CLIP JUST CONFIRMED WHAT I THOUGHT #ALRIGHTINTHE60S JOHN LENNON WAS JUST A COMPLETE C***! YOU DON'T TAKE THE P*** OUT OF DISABLED PPL." SPEAKING EXCLUSIVELY TO DAILY STAR ONLINE, LORAINNE BELLAMY, SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE LEARNING DISABILITY CHARITY MENCAP, SAID: "AS SOMEONE WITH A LEARNING DISABILITY THIS FOOTAGE SHOCKED ME AND WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH. "TIMES MAY HAVE CHANGED BUT I ALWAYS FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE HOW SUCH FAMOUS PEOPLE CAN HAVE THESE HORRIBLE VIEWS ABOUT REAL PEOPLE." SHE ADDED: "I HAVE SEEN ATTITUDES TOWARDS PEOPLE LIKE ME CHANGE A GREAT DEAL SINCE I WAS A CHILD. IT WASNT UNCOMMON FOR PEOPLE WITH A LEARNING DISABILITY TO BE PUBLICALLY LAUGHED AT AND MADE FUN OF AT THE TIME. "MUCH HAS CHANGED BUT THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THE PUBLIC REALISES PEOPLE WITH A LEARNING DISABILITY HAVE THE SAME HOPES, DREAMS AND FEELINGS AS ANYONE ELSE, AND SHOULD BE TREATED WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF RESPECT AS ANYONE. "WE ARE NOT HERE TO BE LAUGHED AT AND I HOPE THAT TODAYS CELEBRITIES WOULD NEVER CONSIDER ACTING LIKE THIS." WHILE NOT AN EXCUSE TO JUSTIFY THE VIDEO, JOHN DID SUBMERGE HIMSELF IN PHILANTHROPY BEFORE HIS MURDER, SUPPORTING THE PEACE MOVEMENT AND FOUNDATIONS SUCH AS AID STILL REQUIRED AND UNICEF. YT INSENSITIVE: FANS ARE IN UPROAR OVER JOHN'S SENSE OF HUMOUR
365	REVISION. IS YOUR DOCTOR KEEPING A SECRET FROM YOU? IF YOU DONT KNOW YOUR BREAST DENSITY, YOU DONT HAVE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR BREAST HEALTH, SAID NANCY CAPPELLO, A FORMER EDUCATION ADMINISTRATOR FROM WOODBURY, CONNECTICUT, WHO STARTED THE ARE YOU DENSE CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE OTHER WOMEN. CAPPELLO CALLS BREAST DENSITY A BEST-KEPT SECRET. IF YOU HAVE A MAMMOGRAM, YOUR DOCTOR KNOWS YOUR BREAST DENSITY, BUT IS HE SHARING THIS CRITICAL INFORMATION WITH YOU? DEPENDING ON WHICH STATE YOU LIVE IN, THE ANSWER COULD BE NO. NANCYS STORY CAPPELLOS STORY IS SHOCKING. AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF ROUTINE ANNUAL MAMMOGRAMS AND THE HAPPY GRAM REPORTS THAT SHOWED HER RESULTS AS NORMAL WITH NO SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS, CAPPELLO WAS TOLD SHE HAD CANCER WHEN A DOCTOR NOTICED A SUSPICIOUS RIDGE IN HER RIGHT BREAST DURING AN ANNUAL PHYSICAL EXAM. A SUBSEQUENT MAMMOGRAM REVEALED NOTHING, BUT AN ULTRASOUND SHOWED STAGE 3C CANCER THAT HAD SPREAD TO 13 LYMPH FROM THE SIZE AND HOW IT METASTASIZED, THE CANCER HAD BEEN GROWING FOR SIX YEARS, CAPPELLO SAID. AS A HEALTHY WOMAN AND EDUCATED PATIENT WHO WATCHED HER WEIGHT, EXERCISED REGULARLY AND NEVER MISSED A MAMMOGRAM APPOINTMENT, CAPPELLO WAS BOWLED OVER TO LEARN SHE HAD ADVANCED BREAST CANCER. THATS WHEN HER DOCTOR TOLD HER ABOUT HER BREAST TISSUE AND HOW IT CAN HIDE CANCER ON A MAMMOGRAM. I ASKED, WHY WASNT I TOLD I HAVE DENSE BREAST TISSUE? THE RESPONSE WAS THAT ITS NOT STANDARD PROTOCOL TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH THE PATIENT, CAPPELLO SAID. SHE WENT INTO ACTION, AND CONNECTICUT WAS THE FIRST STATE TO PASS A BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION WHAT DOES DENSE MEAN? DENSE BREAST TISSUE IS NOT ABNORMAL. ITS JUST THE WAY A WOMAN IS BUILT, SAID DR. KATHRYN EVERS, DIRECTOR OF BREAST IMAGING AT FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER IN PHILADELPHIA.  JUST TRUST ME, AND SHE WILL BE ALL RIGHT. ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS DENSE BREAST TISSUE, WHICH MEANS THAT IT HAS A HIGH PROPORTION OF GLANDULAR OR CONNECTIVE TISSUE. A RADIOLOGIST READS A MAMMOGRAM AND RATES IT IN FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FROM EXTREMELY FATTY TO EXTREMELY DENSE, SAID DR. EMILY F. CONANT, PROFESSOR AND CHIEF, DIVISION OF BREAST IMAGING, DEPARTMENT OF RADIOLOGY, HOSPITAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. TEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE HAVE ENTIRELY FATTY BREAST TISSUE AND 10 PERCENT HAVE EXTREMELY DENSE BREAST TISSUE. THE OTHER 80 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS BROKEN DOWN EVENLY BETWEEN SCATTERED FIBROGLANDULAR (FATTY) TISSUE AND HETEROGENEOUSLY DENSE. DENSE BREAST TISSUE TUMORS ON A MAMMOGRAM, EVERS SAID. FATTY TISSHUE SHOWS UP GREYISH BLACK ON A MAMMOGRAM, MAKING IT STAND OUT. DENSE TISSUE LOOKS WHITE. BREAST MASSES OR TUMORS ALSO APPEAR WHITE ON A MAMMOGRAM, MAKING THEM HARD OR IMPOSSIBLE TO SPOT IN DENSE BREASTS.  THE ORGANIZATION IS OPEN TO BOYS AND GIRLS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 6-14 WHO PLAY ON TEAMS ORGANIZED ACCORDING TO AGE AND WEIGHT GUIDELINES. PAGE 2 OF 3 - BREAST DENSITY VARIES BY AGE AND WEIGHT, CONANT SAID. AS WOMEN AGE THEIR BREASTS BECOME LESS DENSE.  NOT ONLY CAN DENSE BREAST TISSUE HIDE CANCER ON A MAMMOGRAM, THERE IS SOME RISK FOR BREAST CANCER FOR WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS, EVERS SAID. ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO TELL IF YOUR BREASTS ARE DENSE BY SIGHT OR FEEL. ITS NOT A MATTER OF A BREAST FEELING FIRM OR LUMPY, EVERS SAID. BREAST DENSITY CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY A MAMMOGRAM, SHE SAID. INFORMATION EXPENSE AND THATS WHERE A BIT OF CONTROVERSY COMES IN, CONANT SAID. TWENTY-FOUR STATES HAVE LAWS THAT REQUIRE HEALTH FACILITIES TO NOTIFY WOMEN IF THEY HAVE DENSE ELEVEN OTHER STATES ARE BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAWS, AND NATIONWIDE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS. WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW AND DESERVES TO BE EDUCATED SO SHE CAN MAKE INFORMED HEALTH-CARE CHOICES AND POSSIBLY SEEK ADDITIONAL SCREENING METHODS, CAPPELLO SAID. THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT, THOUGH, IS WARY OF CREATING PANIC AND ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO SEEK OUT COSTLY ADDITIONAL SCREENING TESTS, CONANT SAID. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW THEIR BREAST DENSITY, CONANT SAYS. BUT TELLING WOMEN CAUSES FRUSTRATION BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THERE ARE RISKS AND BENEFITS TO MAMMOGRAMS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE NEGATIVES. FOR A WOMAN WITH DENSE BREASTS, AN ULTRASOUND IS A COMPLEMENTARY SCREENING, CONANT SAID: USED MAMMOGRAMS, ULTRASOUNDS MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING BREAST CANCER BUT THEY COME WITH MANY FALSE NEGATIVES AND POSITIVES. AN MRI IS A VERY GOOD TOOL. IT FINDS MORE CANCERS THAN MAMMOGRAM AND HAS SLIGHTLY FEWER FALSE POSITIVES THAN A MAMMOGRAM, CONANT SAID. BUT MRIS CAN COST THOUSANDS, AND INSURANCE WONT COVER IT IN THE CASE OF A WOMAN WHO HAS DENSE BREASTS AND NO OTHER HIGH-RISK FACTORS. THREE-DIMENSIONAL MAMMOGRAMS ARE THE BEST SCREENING METHOD FOR BREAST CANCER, CONANT SAID. ITS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE THE BENEFITS OF 3-D MAMMOGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOR THE RADIOLOGIST TO ZOOM IN, MAGNIFY AND CHANGE THE CONTRAST OF THE BREAST IMAGE AND VIEW IT IN SLICES FOR MORE PRECISE IMAGES, FLEXIBLE PLATES FOR GREATER COMFORT AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FALSE POSITIVES. ADVICE THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY RECOMMENDS WOMEN GET AN ANNUAL MAMMOGRAM STARTING AT AGE 40, CONTINUING AS LONG AS A WOMANS IN GOOD HEALTH. AS A WOMAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOUR DOCTOR, CAPPELLO SAID. THE INFORMATION SHOULD NEVER BE HIDDEN. FIND OUT YOUR BREAST DENSITY AND WHAT IMPACT IT CAN HAVE ON YOUR BREAST HEALTH.

369	(REUTERS/BRIAN SNYDER) REPUBLICAN 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BUSINESSMAN DONALD TRUMP (L) TALKS WITH FELLOW CANDIDATE AND FORMER GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA JEB BUSH DURING A COMMERCIAL BREAK AT THE FIRST OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE OF THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN CLEVELAND, OHIO, AUGUST 6, 2015. DONALD TRUMP HAS REMAINED THE FRONT-RUNNER. BUT HE NOW HAS A NEW POTENTIAL MAIN FOIL, AND SOME OF HIS FELLOW BIG-NAME RIVALS HAVE SLIPPED. THE SECOND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IS SET FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT IN SIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA, WHERE 11 CANDIDATES WILL SQUARE OFF ON THE MAIN STAGE. NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED WITH THE CANDIDATES WHO MADE IT TO THE MAIN EVENT THE ONLY ADDITION TO THE TOP TIER IS FORMER HEWLETT PACKARD CEO CARLY FIORINA, MEANING THE LATEST GOP DEBATE WILL HAVE 11 CANDIDATES INSTEAD OF LAST MONTH'S 10 . BUT THE POSITIONS FOR THOSE CANDIDATES, IN SOME CASES, HAVE SHIFTED DRAMATICALLY. SOME CANDIDATES ENTER INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH ALL THE MOMENTUM AND SOME COULD DRASTICALLY USE A GOOD PERFORMANCE TO GIVE THEIR CAMPAIGNS A KICK. HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT'S CHANGED OVER THE PAST MONTH-PLUS. THE POLLING ACCORDING TO REAL CLEAR POLITICS' AVERAGE OF SIXRECENT NATIONAL POLLS, HERE'S A LOOK AT WHERE THE CANDIDATES STAND GOING INTO WEDNESDAYNIGHT. FROM THE TOP TIER: DONALD TRUMP, REAL-ESTATE MAGNATE: 29.8% AVERAGE AS OF WEDNESDAY (UP FROM A24.3% AVERAGE BEFORE THE AUGUST 6 DEBATE) BEN CARSON, RETIRED NEUROSURGEON : 17.8% (UP FROM 5.8%) JEB BUSH, FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR: 7.8% (DOWN FROM12.5%) TED CRUZ, US SENATOR FROM TEXAS: 6.7% (UP FROM5.5%) MARCO RUBIO, US SENATOR FROM FLORIDA: 5.8% (UP FROM5.3%) MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: 4.3% (DOWN FROM6.8%) CARLY FIORINA, FORMER HEWLETT PACKARD CEO: 4.3% (UP FROM 1.3%) SCOTT WALKER, WISCONSIN GOVERNOR: 3.8% (DOWN FROM9.5%) JOHN KASICH, OHIO GOVERNOR: 3.5% (UP FROM2.8%) RAND PAUL, US SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY: 2.7% (DOWN FROM4.5%) CHRIS CHRISTIE, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: 2.0% (DOWN FROM3.5%) (THOMSON REUTERS) REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARSON SPEAKS TO THE PRESS AFTER SPEAKING AT THE COMMONWEALTH CLUB IN SAN FRANCISCO TRUMP SOARS A PROMINENT FEUD WITH FOX NEWS HOST AND DEBATE MODERATOR MEGYN KELLY DID NOTHING TO SLOW DOWN TRUMP'S MAGNANIMOUS RISE, AND HE HAS ONLY SOLIDIFIED HIS LEAD OVER THE PAST MONTH. "SEEMINGLYNOTHING CAN BRING HIM DOWN," SAID GREG VALLIERE , THE CHIEF POLITICAL STRATEGIST AT THE POTOMAC RESEARCH GROUP. "IT'S WAY TOO EARLYTO CONSIDER HIM THE FAVORITE TO WIN THE NOMINATION POLLS SHOW 60% OF ALL AMERICANS DON'T TRUST HIM AND 60% DON'TTHINK HE'S QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT. BUT TRUMP IS IN FOR THE LONG-HAUL, AND HAS INFLICTED ENORMOUS DAMAGE ON ALLTHE OTHER GOP CANDIDATES." CARSON RISES CARSON IS NOW NIPPING AT TRUMP'S HEELS BUT PERHAPS A BIGGER STORY IS, TOGETHER, WHAT THEY EXEMPLIFY. A NEW POLL OUT TUESDAY SHOWED TRUMP AND CARSON TWO POLITICAL OUTSIDERS COMBINING FOR HALF THE GOP PRIMARY VOTE AT THIS POINT IN THE RACE. A THEME OF THE CAMPAIGN THUS FAR ON THE GOP SIDE HAS BEEN THE RISE OF THE OUTSIDERS TRUMP, CARSON, AND CARLY FIORINA AS THE PARTY BASE SIGNALS IT'S READY TO MOVE ON FROM MORE ESTABLISHMENT FAVORITES. "THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE ATTENTION THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BROUGHT TO HIMSELF AND THE CAMPAIGN HAS WORKED IN OUR FAVOR," DOUG WATTS, THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR OF CARSON'S CAMPAIGN, TOLD BUSINESS INSIDER RECENTLY. "WHY DOES IT WORK IN OUR FAVOR AND NOT EVERYBODY ELSE'S FAVOR? ... I THINK THE ANSWER'S PRETTY CLEAR: THAT NOT SINCE 1992 HAS AMERICA REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS BEEN SO KEEN ON NOT ELECTING, REELECTING, TRADITIONAL LIFETIME POLITICIANS. THEY'RE JUST SICK AND TIRED OF IT. THE OL' EINSTEIN QUOTE, WHICH WASN'T ACTUALLY FROM EINSTEIN: 'THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND EXPECTING A DIFFERENT RESULT.'" (REUTERS/JOSHUA LOTT) TWO EARLY FAVORITES FALTER JEB BUSH AND SCOTT WALKER WERE TWO EARLY POPULAR FAVORITES TO WIN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. BUT THEY HAVE SEENTHE BIGGEST DECLINES OVER THE LAST MONTH. WALKER'S PLUNGE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY NOTABLE , AND HE HAS FALLEN DRAMATICALLY IN THE FIRST-CAUCUS STATE OF IOWA, WHICH IS CENTRAL TO HIS PATH TO THE NOMINATION. BUSH, MEANWHILE, IS STILL IN DECENT POLL SHAPE BUT HE HAS STRUGGLED TO SHOW SIGNS HE'S THE FRONT-RUNNER MANY CLEARLY THOUGHT HE WOULD BE. A NEW 'FACE' CARLY FIORINA IS THE SOLE NEW ADDITION TO THE MAIN-STAGE DEBATE. SHE HAS SOARED 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER THE LAST MONTH-PLUS, AND EVEN MORE IN KEY EARLY STATES LIKE IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. FIORINA WILL LOOK TO PROVE THAT SHE BELONGS AND YOU CAN EXPECT A TANGLE OR TWO WITH TRUMP. " WELL, I THINK MR. TRUMP'S GOING TO BE HEARING QUITE A LOT FROM ME," SHE TOLD CNBC . TRUMP CAUSED CONTROVERSY LAST WEEK WHEN HE MOCKED FIORINA'S APPEARANCE IN COMMENTS THAT WERE PUBLISHED AS PART OF A MAGAZINE INTERVIEW. "LOOK AT THAT FACE! ... WOULD ANYONE VOTE FOR THAT?" TRUMP WAS QUOTED ASKING WHILE WATCHING FIORINA ON THE NEWS." TRUMP AND FIORINA DO SHARE ONE FEATURE: THEY'RE BOTH POLITICAL OUTSIDERS, OF WHICH REPUBLICAN VOTERS SEEMINGLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH THIS CAMPAIGN. (THOMSON REUTERS) U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLY FIORINA SPEAKS AT THE NEW HAMPSHIRE EDUCATION SUMMIT IN LONDONDERRY THE ISSUES IN AUGUST, A KEY POINT OF POLICY DEBATE WAS THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HAS CLINCHED ENOUGH SUPPORT FOR THAT DEAL TO GO THROUGH AND BE IMPLEMENTED MEANING IT WON'T DISAPPEAR FROM THE CONVERSATION WEDNESDAY NIGHT, BUT COULD FADE AND WILL CHANGE IN SCOPE. THE LOOMING POLICY DEBATE OF THE MONTH THAT WILL COME UP IN WEDNESDAY'S DEBATE WILL BE OVER KEEPING THE GOVERNMENT FUNDED AND PREVENTING IT FROM SHUTTING DOWN . CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WANT TO COMPLETELY DE-FUND THE WOMEN'S HEALTH AND FAMILY PLANNING ORGANIZATION PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN THE BUDGET,AFTER THE ORGANIZATION HAS COME UNDER INTENSE SCRUTINY AFTER THE RELEASE OF UNDERCOVER VIDEOS THAT SHOW A PLANNED PARENTHOOD EXECUTIVE DISCUSSING USING ABORTED FETUSES FOR RESEARCH. DEMOCRATS AND THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE DEFENDED PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND IF REPUBLICANS MAKE GOOD ON THEIR THREAT TO WITHHOLD FUNDING FOR THE ORGANIZATION AS PART OF THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS, IT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY LEAD TO A SHUTDOWN. REPUBLICAN LEADERS, MOST NOTABLY SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KENTUCKY), HAVE PLEDGED TO AVOID A SHUTDOWN. BUT THE ISSUE HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF A LITMUS TEST FOR REPUBLICANS. AND IT SHOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHICH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ADVOCATE FOR GOING THROUGH WITH DE-FUNDING AND WHICH WANT TO AVOID A SHUTDOWN AT ALL COSTS. NOW WATCH: DONALD TRUMPS NET WORTH ACCORDING TO SOMEONE WHO ISNT DONALD TRUMP MORE FROM BUSINESS INSIDER
370	IN A BREAK FROM THEIR NORMAL ROAD, CROSS COUNTRY AND TRAIL RUNS, THE GADE VALLEY HARRIERS CHALLENGED THEMSELVES IN THE CLUBS MAGIC MILE EVENT. THE ATHLETES SPILT INTO TWO GROUPS, WHO RACED FOR ONE MILE AROUND THE ATHLETICS TRACK AT JARMAN PARK. BEFORE THE RACES, EACH RUNNER HAD TO GUESS WHAT THEIR FINISHING TIME WOULD BE AND WERE GIVEN PENALTY POINTS FOR EACH SECOND THEY WERE OUT. AT THE END OF THE RACES, THE PENALTY POINTS WERE ADDED UP BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES, WITH THE TEAM HAVING THE LOWEST SCORE WINNING THE CAPTAINS CUP WHICH THIS YEAR THE MEN WON BY A NARROW MARGIN. IN ANOTHER GVH CLUB RACE, THURSDAY SAW THE LAST IN THE SERIES OF FIVE SUMMER HANDICAP RUNS. THE RUNNERS WERE SET OFF ROUND A 4.1-MILE LOOP ACCORDING TO THEIR SPEED, WITH THE SLOWEST PREDICTED RUNNER SETTING OFF FIRST AND BEING GIVEN A HEAD START BEFORE THE NEXT RUNNER PURSUES THEM THE IDEA BEING THAT ALL RUNNERS FINISH AT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME. THE COMPLICATED POINTS SYSTEM WAS COMPILED FROM THE FIVE RACES, AND THE WINNER WILL BE ANNOUNCED AT THE GADE VALLEY AGM MEETING LATER THIS MONTH. ELSEWHERE, DYLAN WENDLEKEN FROM GADE VALLEY TRI WAS IN ACTION AT THE HERTS TRIATHLON IN WELWYN ON SUNDAY. WENDLEKEN TOOK ON HIS FAVOURITE SPRINT DISTANCE RACE, WHICH INVOLVES A 750M SWIM, A 20KM BIKE RIDE AND A 5KM RUN, FINISHING IN A TOTAL TIME OF 1:19:36 AND ACHIEVING SECOND PLACE IN HIS AGE GROUP. BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY SAW HARRIER RUSS BAILEY COMPETING IN THE HARWELL HALF MARATHON IN DIDCOT, OXFORDSHIRE. BAILEY COMPLETED THE 13.1-MILE COURSE IN 2:09:05 AS PART OF HIS TRAINING FOR THE BERLIN MARATHON ON SEPTEMBER 27. CROSSING THE POND TO THE USA WAS PETER TUCKER WHO RAN THE CENTRAL PARK RUN FOR LIFE IN NEW YORK. TUCKER BRAVED THE HEAT TO FINISH THE 8KM RACE IN A RESPECTABLE 48:35.  (ONLY BY COINCIDENCE IS THAT WHEREAMAZONS SEATTLE HEADQUARTERS WASLOCATED UNTIL RECENTLY.) PACMED AND PROVIDENCE FORMED A PARTNERSHIP A YEAR AGO AIMED TOIMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE,WHILE REDUCING COSTS. A GOOD TURNOUT AT THE BLACK PARK PARKRUN ON SATURDAY SAW SEVEN HARRIERS COMPETING WITH 462 OTHER RUNNERS. MATT ASHBY WAS FIRST HOME FOR THE HARRIERS IN A SPEEDY 19:16, FINISHING IN FIFTH POSITION OVERALL. ASHBY WAS CHASED HOME BY VINCE ELLERBY IN 20:03, IN 12TH PLACE. NEXT BACK WERE STEVE NEWING 20:12, PAULA COOK 26:45, CLAIRE NEWING 34:54 (PB), ALICE COOK 36:25 (PB) AND JENNY BARNETT 36:26.

371	AS A SOCIAL SCIENTIST, I'M PREDISPOSED TO FAVOR COLLECTING AND DISSEMINATING MORE INFORMATION. BUT A FEBRUARY 2015 REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON FEDERAL REGULATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION, CALLED RECALIBRATING REGULATION OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, OFFERS A USEFUL REMINDER THAT PRODUCING ALL THAT INFORMATION ISN'T FREE. AS BACKGROUND, THE TASK FORCE WAS CREATED BY A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF US SENATORS. IT WAS MADE UP MOSTLY OF PRESIDENTS AND CHANCELLORS AND TOP EXECUTIVES FROM A RANGE OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY, COLORADO CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, HIRAM COLLEGE, HARTWICK COLLEGE, SAM HOUSTON STATE UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE, LAUREATE ONLINE EDUCATION, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, RASMUSSEN COLLEGE, NORTH CAROLINA AGRICULTURAL AND TECHNICAL STATE UNIVERSITY, TENNESSEE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ASSOCIATION, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, AND NORTHERN VIRGINIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM SUCH AN AUTHORSHIP, THE REPORT INCLUDES LOTS OF TERMS LIKE CONSOLIDATE, PROMULGATE, PROBLEMATIC, AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS. BUT MORE TO MY TASTE, THE REPORT ALSO HAS SOME INTRIGUING BIG-PICTURE ESTIMATES AND VIVID EXAMPLES. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE ESTIMATE IS THAT COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL RULES REPRESENT MORE THAN 10% OF TOTAL COSTS AT A MAJOR UNIVERSITY: ANOTHER FAR-REACHING ANALYSIS WAS LAUNCHED BY VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY IN 2014. INITIAL FINDINGS REVEAL THAT APPROXIMATELY 11 PERCENT, OR $150 MILLION, OF VANDERBILTS 2013 EXPENDITURES WERE DEVOTED TO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL MANDATES. NEARLY 70 PERCENT OF THESE COSTS WERE ABSORBED INTO DIFFERENT OFFICES, AFFECTING A BROAD SWATH OF FACULTY, RESEARCH STAFF, ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF, AND TRAINEES IN ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS. VANDERBILT IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO TEST ITS METHODOLOGY ON DIFFERENT CAMPUSES. THE REPORT LAMENTS THAT FEDERAL REGULATORY BURDENS ON INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION KEEP RISING, THAT THE PROCESS FOR JUDGING WHETHER INSTITUTIONS ARE COMPLYING WITH THESE BURDENS IS OFTEN CAPRICIOUS AND COSTLY AS WELL, AND THAT IN MANY CASES THE RULES HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH ACTUALLY EDUCATING STUDENTS. HERE'S A TASTE OF THE DISCUSSION: TWO EXAMPLES HIGHLIGHT THE INCREASING COMPLEXITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATIONS REACH. FIRST, IN THE EARLY 1950S, ACCREDITING AGENCIES QUALIFIED FOR RECOGNITION BY THE U.S. OFFICE OF EDUCATION BY MEETING FIVE STRAIGHTFORWARD CRITERIA. TODAY, HOWEVER, STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FILL NINE PAGES OF THE HEA, AND THE DEPARTMENTS APPLICATION FOR AGENCIES SEEKING RECOGNITION HAS EXPANDED TO 88 PAGES. ANY AGENCY THAT SEEKS INITIAL OR RENEWED RECOGNITION MUST EXPECT TO DEVOTE SEVERAL PERSON YEARS TO FILING THE APPROPRIATE FEDERAL PAPERWORK. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE EXPANSION OF DATA COLLECTION MANDATES IMPOSED ON COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THE INTEGRATED POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION DATA SURVEY (IPEDS) WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED AS A VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY IN 1985-86. TODAY, PARTICIPATION IN IPEDS IS MANDATORY AND REQUIRES COMPLETION OF NINE SEPARATE SURVEYS THAT TOGETHER EXCEED 300 PAGES. ... HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL STATUTORY, REGULATORY, AND SUB-REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, STEMMING FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY FEDERAL AGENCY AND TOTALING THOUSANDS OF PAGES. FOCUSING SOLELY ON REQUIREMENTS INVOLVING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, THE HEA CONTAINS ROUGHLY 1,000 PAGES OF STATUTORY LANGUAGE; THE ASSOCIATED RULES IN THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS ADD ANOTHER 1,000 PAGES. INSTITUTIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE FORM OF SUB-REGULATORY GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DEPARTMENTS 2013-14 FEDERAL STUDENT AID HANDBOOK, A GUIDEBOOK FOR ADMINISTERING STUDENT AID THAT AMPLIFIES AND CLARIFIES THE FORMAL REGULATIONS, IS MORE THAN 1,050 PAGES. THE DEPARTMENTS HANDBOOK FOR CAMPUS SAFETY AND SECURITY REPORTING (ALSO KNOWN AS THE CLERY HANDBOOK) CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 300 PAGES, AND WILL SOON EXPAND SIGNIFICANTLY IN LIGHT OF NEW REGULATIONS ISSUED IN 2014. IN 2012 ALONE, THE DEPARTMENT RELEASED APPROXIMATELY 270 DEAR COLLEAGUE LETTERS AND OTHER ELECTRONIC ANNOUNCEMENTSTHIS MEANS THAT MORE THAN ONE NEW DIRECTIVE OR CLARIFICATION WAS ISSUED EVERY WORKING DAY OF THE YEAR. ... AMONG THE MANY FEDERAL RULES WITH WHICH COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MUST COMPLY, INFORMATION DISCLOSURE MANDATES ARE PARTICULARLY VOLUMINOUS. SECTION 485 OF THE HEA, WHICH DETAILS INSTITUTIONAL DISCLOSURES ON A HOST OF ISSUES, RUNS SOME 30 PAGES OF LEGISLATIVE TEXT AND INCLUDES 22 SEPARATE INFORMATION DISSEMINATION REQUIREMENTS. ... THE FEDERAL STUDENT AID OFFICE AT THE DEPARTMENT PUBLISHES A SUMMARY CHART OF THE VARIOUS CONSUMER INFORMATION DISCLOSURES. ALTHOUGH THIS CHART IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CONSUMER DISCLOSURES AT-A-GLANCE, IT IS CURRENTLY 31 PAGES LONG. BETWEEN CRIME REPORTING AND POLICY DISCLOSURES, THE CLERY ACT AND RELATED DEPARTMENTAL GUIDANCE REQUIRE MORE THAN 90 SEPARATE POLICY STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES. IN SUM, THE SHEER NUMBER OF REGULATORY PROVISIONS THAT AFFECTS INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION CONSTITUTES A VOLUMINOUS AND EXPANDING BURDEN. IN A NUMBER OF CASES, ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE A CERTAIN RULE NEVER SEEM TO END, BUT INSTEAD ONLY LEAD TO MORE RULES. FOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDER THE RULES FOR DISCLOSING WHETHER VOCATIONALLY-ORIENTED PROGRAMS LEAD TO "GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT": [W]ITH RESPECT TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT, THE DEPARTMENT FIRST ISSUED A COMPLEX AND LENGTHY SET OF RULES ON THIS TOPIC IN 2010. HOWEVER, FOLLOWING A COURT CHALLENGE THAT STRUCK DOWN THE DEPARTMENTS PROPOSED METRICS FOR JUDGING GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS, IT BEGAN A NEW NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING SESSION. FINAL REGULATIONS STEMMING FROM THIS SECOND EFFORT WERE ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2014. THE 2014 FINAL RULE IS ALMOST 950 PAGES LONG, INCLUDING A 610-PAGE PREAMBLE AND MORE THAN 50 TABLES AND CHARTS. IN DECIDING TO PROCEED WITH A SECOND RULEMAKING ON THIS TOPIC, THE DEPARTMENT WAS UNDETERRED BY BOTH A FEDERAL COURT DECISION AND BY THE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BLOCKING FURTHER REGULATION IN THIS AREA UNTIL CONGRESS CONSIDERED THE ISSUE. OR CONSIDER THE CLERY ACT, WHICH "REQUIRES COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO REPORT THE CRIMES THAT OCCURRED ON CAMPUS IN AN ANNUAL SECURITY REPORT. THEY ALSO MUST REPORT INCIDENTS OCCURRING ON NONCAMPUS PROPERTY, DEFINED AS A BUILDING OR PROPERTY OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY AN INSTITUTION AND USED IN DIRECT SUPPORT OF OR IN RELATION TO THE INSTITUTIONS EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE. HOWEVER, THIS BROAD DEFINITION HAS CREATED ENORMOUS CONFUSION," AS THE REPORT SPELLS OUT: GUIDANCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT BOTH IN THE HANDBOOK FOR CAMPUS SAFETY AND SECURITY REPORTING AND SUBSEQUENT DIRECTIVES INDICATE THAT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MUST REPORT CRIMES THAT HAPPEN IN ANY BUILDING OR PROPERTY THEY RENT, LEASE, OR HAVE ANY WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO USE (INCLUDING AN INFORMAL AGREEMENT, SUCH AS ONE THAT MIGHT BE FOUND IN A LETTER, EMAIL, OR HOTEL CONFIRMATION). EVEN IF NO PAYMENT IS INVOLVED IN THE TRANSACTION, ANY WRITTEN AGREEMENT REGARDING THE USE OF SPACE GIVES AN INSTITUTION CONTROL OF THE SPACE FOR THE TIME PERIOD SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT. THE HANDBOOK REQUIRES COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO DISCLOSE STATISTICS FOR CRIMES THAT OCCUR DURING THE DATES AND TIMES SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE SPECIFIC AREA OF A BUILDING USED (E.G., THE THIRD FLOOR AND COMMON AREAS LEADING TO THE SPACES USED, SUCH AS THE LOBBY, HALLWAYS, STAIRWELLS, AND ELEVATORS). DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE MANDATES THAT SCHOOLS REPORT ON STUDY ABROAD LOCATIONS WHEN THE SCHOOL RENTS SPACE FOR STUDENTS IN A HOTEL OR OTHER FACILITY, AND ON LOCATIONS USED BY AN INSTITUTIONS ATHLETIC TEAMS IN SUCCESSIVE YEARS (E.G., THE INSTITUTION USES THE SAME HOTEL EVERY YEAR FOR THE FIELD HOCKEY TEAMS AWAY GAMES). AS A CONSEQUENCE, INSTITUTIONS MUST ATTEMPT TO COLLECT CRIME DATA FROM DOZENS, IF NOT HUNDREDS, OF LOCATIONS ... ONE INSTITUTION HAS INDICATED THAT IT REQUESTS DATA FROM 69 POLICE DEPARTMENTS, COVERING 348 LOCATIONS IN 13 STATES AND FIVE COUNTRIES, INCLUDING POLICE AT AIRPORTS AND ON MILITARY BASES. THE MANDATE THAT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MUST COLLECT DATA FROM FOREIGN ENTITIES IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME. ... IN RESPONSE TO ONE SUCH REQUEST, A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ACCUSED A U.S. INSTITUTION OF ESPIONAGE. THE TASK FORCE ALSO NOTES THAT CERTAIN SUBSTANTIAL FEDERAL RULES DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH EVALUATING EDUCATION, OR WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS, BUT THE RULES WERE INSTEAD ENACTED FOR OTHER REASONS--WHILE REQUIRING COLLEGES TO PAY THE COSTS. HOWEVER, AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF FEDERAL OVERSIGHT HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THESE RESPONSIBILITIES AND HAS MORE TO DO WITH PURSUING BROADER GOVERNMENTAL GOALS. TO CITE SEVERAL OBVIOUS EXAMPLES, SELECTIVE SERVICE REGISTRATION, DETAILED VOTER REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS, PEER-TO-PEER FILE SHARING, AND FOREIGN GIFT REPORTING ARE UNRELATED TO THE CENTRAL AREAS OF FEDERAL CONCERN IN HIGHER EDUCATION. WHILE THE POLICY OBJECTIVES ARE WORTHWHILE, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PURSUING THEM SHOULD NOT FALL TO INSTITUTIONS. WE BELIEVE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHETHER THEY REGISTER WITH THE SELECTIVE SERVICE, NOT THE COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY WHERE THEY HAPPEN TO BE ENROLLED. FURTHER, WHILE SOME RULES MAY BE TANGENTIALLY RELATED TO HIGHER EDUCATION, SUCH AS DISCLOSING INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES ON CANDLES IN DORMITORIES AND STUDENT VACCINATIONS, THEY ARE NOT OF SUFFICIENTLY WIDESPREAD INTEREST TO WARRANT A FEDERAL MANDATE. THE HIGH COSTS OF FEDERAL REGULATION ARE CLEARLY A REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL ISSUE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION, CONTRIBUTING TO THE VERY HIGH COSTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT DON'T FORGET BROADEN YOUR VIEW AND REMEMBER THAT THESE KINDS OF GOVERNMENT RULES ABOUT COLLECTING AND PROVIDING INFORMATION ARE LEGION ACROSS THE US ECONOMY, TOO. I DO LOVE INFORMATION, AS I SAID AT THE START. BUT IT'S VERY EASY TO COME UP WITH REASONS WHY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD COLLECT ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION. SUCH REQUIREMENTS AREN'T FREE.

POLICE WILL EVEN KNOW THE BALANCE OF YOUR COMMUTER TRAIN/BUS CARDS, ALL WITHOUT A WARRANT! DHS AND TECHNOLOGY DIRECTORATES ELECTRONIC RECOVERY AND ACCESS TO DATA (ERAD) PREPAID CARD READER IS NOW BEING USED TO READ EVERY MAGNETIC-STRIPED CARD. THE ERAD PREPAID CARD READER IS A SMALL, HANDHELD DEVICE THAT USES WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY TO ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE FIELD TO CHECK THE BALANCE OF CARDS. THIS ALLOWS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF SUSPICIOUS PREPAID CARDS AND THE ABILITY TO PUT A TEMPORARY HOLD ON THE LINKED FUNDS UNTIL A FULL INVESTIGATION CAN BE COMPLETED. READING BETWEEN THE LINES, ONCE YOURE ARRESTED IF YOURE CARRYING A SUSPICIOUS CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD POLICECANPUT A TEMPORARY HOLD ON YOUR ACCOUNT!

IT PROVIDES A UNIQUE TOOL FOR WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER SUSPECT CARDS WITH MAGNETIC STRIPS DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTIES. OF COURSE ERAD IS GENERATING A LOT OF INTEREST FROM STATE AND LOCAL POLICE, THEY NEED TO FIND NEW WAYS TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS AND KEEP THE AMERICAN POLICE STATE GOING.

BUT MY NAME IS LAUREN AND I'M A NEW GRADUATE NAVIGATING THROUGH THE REAL WORLD TRYING TO DIG DEEP INTO WHAT MAKES ME TICK.THE REAL WORLD FOR ME BEING, MOVING TO A NEW CITY, STARTING A NEW JOB, AND MOLDING NEW FRIENDSHIPS ALONG THE WAY. MY BLOG IS MY HAPPY PLACE. IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT LIKE MY FAVORITE ANTHROPOLOGIE HACK COASTERS, WRITE RECIPES LIKE MY DELICIOUS MEATLOAF, AND DETAIL MY TRAVELS: RUSSIA, SAN DIEGO (PART 1), SAN DIEGO (PART 2), AND MY NEW ADVENTURE OF EAT, PRAY, LOVING IT IN EUROPE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGERS, ERIKA, DOES THIS SERIES OWNING IT WHERE YOU TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR QUIRKS AND WHAT MAKES YOU, WELL, YOU. EVERY TIME I READ A NEW POST ON A NEW BLOGGER I RACK MY BRAIN OF WHAT I DO THAT IS UNIQUE TO ME. ALAS, THIS MAKES THE PERFECT GUEST POST. I BASICALLY GET ALL MY JUNK ON THE TABLE FROM THE GET-GO! THIS COULD GO ONE OF TWO WAYS...SOME PEOPLE WILL RELATE OR JUST LAUGH AT MY CRAZINESS OR SOME PEOPLE MIGHT RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BUT HEY, I'MOWNINGIT. TODAY AND EVERYDAY. HI I'M LAUREN. 22 YEARS OLD AND I STILL SLEEP WITH MY BABY "BLANKET." YES, I PUT BLANKET IN QUOTATIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY, IT ISN'T A BLANKET ANYMORE. HE IS THEREMNANTOF A FORMER BLANKET TIED TOGETHER IN A RAG. ALSO, YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT I REFER TO MY BLANKET AS "HE" BECAUSE HE JUST ALWAYS HAS BEEN. WEIRD, I KNOW. I CALL HIM "T" BECAUSE MY BABYSITTER CALLED HIM MY TRANQUILIZER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND IT STUCK. HE'S A SENSE OF COMFORT AND MAY I SAY, AWELL-TRAVELEDBLANKET. GOOD GRACIOUS, I'VE LOST HALF OF JULIE'S READERS BY THIS POINT. I'M THE CLUMSIEST PERSON YOU'LL MEET BUT I'VE NEVER BROKEN A BONE AND I'VE NEVER HAD STITCHES.

377	7:47 P.M. CDT BY SAIKAT CHATTERJEE HONG KONG (REUTERS) - ASIAN STOCKS LOOKED SET FOR THEIR BIGGEST SINGLE-DAY FALL IN A MONTH ON WEDNESDAY AFTER FACTORY ACTIVITY IN CHINA SHRANK MORE THAN EXPECTED, ADDING TO FEARS OF A WEAKENING GLOBAL ECONOMY AND SENDING INVESTORS INTO SAFER ASSETS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT BONDS. FINANCIAL SPREADBETTERS PREDICTED EUROPEAN MARKETS WOULD FOLLOW ASIA LOWER, WITH BRITAIN'S FTSE 100 SEEN OPENING DOWN 0.9 PERCENT, GERMANY'S DAX 1 PERCENT AND FRANCE'S CAC 40 0.7 PERCENT. S&P MINI FUTURES FELL 1 PERCENT AFTER THE WEAK CHINA REPORT, POINTING TO A WEAKER OPENING ON WALL STREET. MSCI'S BROADEST INDEX OF ASIA-PACIFIC SHARES OUTSIDE JAPAN FELL 2.5 PERCENT, ITS BIGGEST DAILY LOSS SINCE AUG. 24, ACCORDING TO THOMSON REUTERS DATA. CHINA'S STOCKS WERE AMONG THE HARDEST HIT IN THE REGION WITH MAIN INDEXES DOWN MORE THAN 2 PERCENT. AUSTRALIA FELL 2 PERCENT AND SOUTH KOREA SHED 1.5 PERCENT. JAPANESE MARKETS ARE SHUT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. "THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN CHINA REMAINS A CONCERN, INDICATING THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, WHILE THE FED'S COMMENTS LAST WEEK INDICATE A GLASS HALF-EMPTY VIEW OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY," SAID TAI HUI, CHIEF ASIA MARKETS STRATEGIST AT JP MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT IN HONG KONG. MORE EVIDENCE OF A SLOWDOWN IN THE WORLD'S SECOND-BIGGEST ECONOMY WAS EVIDENT IN THE PRELIMINARY CAIXIN/MARKIT CHINA MANUFACTURING PURCHASING MANAGERS' INDEX (PMI). ACTIVITY IN CHINA'S FACTORY SECTOR FAILED TO IMPROVE IN SEPTEMBER AS EXPECTED, AND INSTEAD SHRANK FOR A SEVENTH STRAIGHT MONTH TO ITS WEAKEST LEVEL IN 6-1/2 YEARS, THE PRIVATE SURVEY SHOWED. THE FINDINGS COULD ADD TO FEARS THAT CHINA'S ECONOMY IS COOLING MORE SHARPLY THAN EARLIER EXPECTED, THOUGH MOST ANALYSTS STILL BELIEVE A GRADUAL ALBEIT BUMPY SLOWDOWN IS MORE LIKELY. ON TUESDAY, THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LOWERED ITS GROWTH FORECAST FOR CHINA TO 6.8 PERCENT FOR 2015. SENTIMENT AT ASIA'S BIGGEST COMPANIES TUMBLED AT A RECORD PACE IN THE THIRD QUARTER ON WORRIES ABOUT CHINA AND THE RISKS IT POSES TO GLOBAL GROWTH, A THOMSON REUTERS/INSEAD SURVEY SHOWED. OVERNIGHT ON WALL STREET, THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE FELL 1.09 PERCENT, THE S&P 500 LOST 1.23 PERCENT, AND THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE FELL 1.5 PERCENT TO 4,756.72. LOSSES IN EQUITIES PROMPTED INVESTORS TO PLOUGH FUNDS INTO FIXED-INCOME ASSETS. THE BENCHMARK TWO-YEAR U.S. TREASURY YIELD FELL TO 0.68 PERCENT, NEARING A TWO-WEEK LOW. THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE 10-YEAR BOND AND THE 2-YEAR BOND HAS NARROWED TO 146 BASIS POINTS FROM 176 BASIS POINTS IN EARLY JULY, INDICATING MARKETS WERE EXPECTING SUB-PAR ECONOMIC GROWTH.

379	'SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE,' IS NOT A QUOTE FROM THE BIBLE, BUT THE PRINCIPLE APPLIES IN THE STRATEGIC DISCIPLINES REQUIRED FOR 'GROWING IN GRACE AND IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST.' BY THE TIME THE APOSTLE JOHN HAD PENNED HIS SECOND LETTER, I'M SURE HE HAD ENCOUNTERED A WIDE RANGE OF 'PROFESSORS' AND 'POSSESSORS' OF FAITH. I'M SURE WE ALL HAVE OUR LISTS OF PEOPLE, YOUNG AND OLD, WHO ARE ALL AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THEIR FAITH JOURNEY. SOME, WHO START OUT WITH SUCH ZEAL THEY PUT MANY OTHERS TO SHAME, AT TIMES 'PACK IN' THEIR FAITH AND CALL IT QUITS. OTHERS, WHO HESITATINGLY STRUGGLE WITH BELIEF AND ALWAYS SEEM TO LACK ASSURANCE, NEVERTHELESS PERSEVERE AND GAIN MORE SOLID FOOTING EACH YEAR. AS A PASTORAL FRIEND SAID TO ME ON ONE OCCASION, "I'M SURE WHEN WE GET TO HEAVEN, WE'LL BE SURPRISED WHO'S THERE AND WHO'S NOT." JOHN, AS A DEEPLY CONCERNED PASTORAL LEADER, WARNS AND INSTRUCTS THOSE IN HIS 'FLOCK,' LEST THEY BACKSLIDE. WE ARE CALLED NOT JUST TO WITNESS, BUT TO LEAD THOSE WHO ARE REGENERATED TO BECOME STRONG CHRIST-FOLLOWERS WHO MAY ACCURATELY BE DESCRIBED AS DISCIPLES. NOTE WHAT JOHN SAYS IN VERSES 8-9 - "WATCH OUT THAT YOU DO NOT LOSE WHAT YOU HAVE WORKED FOR, BUT THAT YOU MAY BE REWARDED FULLY. ANYONE WHO RUNS AHEAD AND DOES NOT CONTINUE IN THE TEACHING OF CHRIST DOES NOT HAVE GOD; WHOEVER CONTINUES IN THE TEACHING HAS BOTH THE FATHER AND THE SON." RUNNING HAS ITS PROPER PREPARATION, ATTIRE, PACE, ETC. I'VE HAD A FEW TALKS WITH PASSIONATE RUNNERS WHOSE DAILY ROUTINES MAKE MY IRREGULAR ATTEMPTS LOOK MIGHTY FEEBLE! A FEW YEARS BACK, I WAS INVITED TO SERVE AS THE ANNOUNCER FOR A LOCAL MARATHON. I PROUDLY POSTED TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THAT I WAS 'IN' A MARATHON. I GUESS SERVING AS THE 'VOICE' FOR THE STARTING AND FINISHING PROCESS DOESN'T BURN MANY CALORIES. SPIRITUALLY SPEAKING, JOHN IS INSTRUCTING THESE NEWER SAINTS WHO HAVE JOINED 'THE COURSE.' 'WATCH OUT' HE URGES THEM. TAKE CARE. BE ALERT TO LOSING GROUND IN THE RACE MARKED OUT FOR YOU. LOTS OF RUNNERS HAVE THROUGH TRIALS AND TEMPTATIONS BEEN LED AWAY FROM A FOCUSED PURSUIT OF CHRIST. KEEP IN SHAPE. DON'T LOOK BACK, DON'T LOOK AROUND, BUT AS HEBREWS URGES, "FIX YOUR EYES ON JESUS, THE AUTHOR AND PERFECTER OF OUR FAITH...." DON'T RUN AHEAD. STAY ANCHORED IN TRUTH AND CONTINUE IN THE CHRIST-CENTRED TEACHING, THE VERY CORE OF YOUR FAITH. WHAT HAVE YOU DISCOVERED AS DISTRACTIONS IN YOUR RACE? HAS SOME SINFUL HABIT LURED YOU INTO A SNARE? HAS SOME PASTIME BECOME AN ALL-CONSUMING PURSUIT SO THAT REGULAR SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINES END UP BECOMING ERRATIC? HEED THE WARNING OF THIS PASSAGE. DON'T LET 'MINOR' ISSUES BECOME 'MAJOR' PROBLEMS. BE DISCERNING IN YOUR READING. NOT EVERYONE WHO CLAIMS TO REPRESENT GOD ACTUALLY DOES. THERE ARE MANY DECEIVERS, MANY FALSE PROPHETS WHO ARE LEADING MANY ASTRAY. SATURATE YOURSELF IN SCRIPTURE. KNOW YOUR BIBLE WELL, DON'T JUST KNOW 'ABOUT' YOUR BIBLE. BE ENCOURAGED IN YOUR RACE. REMEMBER THE TRIUNE GOD WHO HAS SAVED YOU IS WITH YOU AND WILL LEAD YOU SAFELY TO THE END.

381	HE TRULY IS THE FASHION GENIUS HE THINKS HE IS KANYE WESTS SECOND COLLECTION FOR ADIDAS, WHICH DEBUTED AT THE NEW YORK FASHION WEEK 2015, WAS MET WIDELY WITH RIDICULE, BUT HE STILL THINKS HES A FASHION GENIUS. UNSURPRISINGLY, HIS WIFE KIM KARDASHIAN WEST IS OF THE SAME OPINION: HE IS A FASHION GENIUS BECAUSE HE IS THE ONE WHO TURNED HER INTO A FASHION ICON. THE LATEST VIDEO FROM CNN STYLE (SEE BELOW) FOCUSES ON KIMS RISE FROM DERIDED REALITY STAR TO THE STATUS OF CELEBRITY ALL DESIGNERS WANT TO PUT IN THE FIRST ROW AT THEIR SHOWS. WHILE THE VIDEO UNDERLINES THAT KIMS INCLUSION IN THE HIGH FASHION WORLD WAS INEVITABLE BECAUSE DESIGNERS HAD STARTED UNDERSTANDING HER POPULARITY (WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH FASHION), SHE LIKES TO THINK ITS BECAUSE OF KANYE. KANYE CHANGED EVERYTHING SHORTLY AFTER KIM AND KANYE WENT PUBLIC WITH THEIR ROMANCE, HIS FIRST CAMEO ON KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS AIRED: IT SHOWED HIM GOING THROUGH HER WARDROBE AND TELLING HER THAT HE WOULD BE DRESSING HER FROM THEN ON. SINCE THEN, KANYE HAS BEEN KIMS STYLIST, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER FIRST PREGNANCY, WHEN SHE SAYS SHE HAD 5 DIFFERENT STYLISTS. THATS SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HORRIBLE SARTORIAL CHOICES SHE MADE THEN. TODAY, KIM KARDASHIAN IS WIDELY CONSIDERED A FASHION ICON, EVEN THOUGH MOST OF HER OUTFITS STILL PROVIDE CELEBRITY BLOGGERS WITH THE BEST JOKE MATERIAL POSSIBLE. I REALLY THINK THAT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY HUSBAND KANYE REALLY CHANGED EVERYTHING, KIM SAYS. I MEAN, BACK IN THE DAY I THOUGHT I HAD THE BEST STYLE. I LOOK BACK AT OUTFITS AND I'M, LIKE, MORTIFIED. KANYE SEES WHATS OUT THERE ON THE STREETS AND JUST KNOWS HOW TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO SOMETHING THAT WOULD LOOK GOOD ON ME. JUST HELPING ME PUSH MY LIMITS A LITTLE BIT AND TRYING NEW THINGS. KANYE DID MANAGE TO TURN KIM INTO AN ICON KANYE IS ALSO THE FIRST TO STATE OUT LOUD THAT KIM WAS AN ICON, THE MARILYN MONROE OF OUR TIMES, THE MOST GORGEOUS, CLASSY AND STYLISH WOMAN IN THE WORLD. CLEARLY, SINCE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN HE LOVED, HE GETS A PASS, BUT THE WORLD KNOWS THAT KIM IS NEITHER FASHIONABLE NOR STYLISH. SHE IS SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT: SHE IS POPULAR, AND IN TODAYS WORLD, POPULARITY MEANS EVERYTHING. EVEN THOUGH FASHION DESIGNERS WILL STILL MOCK HER (BUT ONLY AFTER THEY PUT HER IN THE FIRST ROW AT THEIR SHOWS), EVERYTHING SHE WEARS WILL STILL BECOME A TREND BECAUSE ITS ON HER AND SHE HAS MILLIONS OF ADORING FANS, DYING TO REPLICATE HER LOOK.
382	THE BEST INDICATOR THAT THE NATIONAL RECESSION WAS LIFTING IN MEMPHIS WAS THE EMERGENCE THIS YEAR OF NUMEROUS PLANS FOR NEW HOTELS AND MOTELS. THE PLANNED $57 MILLION IN IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MEMPHIS COOK CONVENTION CENTER HAVE RESTARTED A DISCUSSION ABOUT LONGER-TERM PLANS FOR AN EXPANSION THAT COULD INCLUDE TWO NEW RIVERSIDE HOTELS. (FLEMING ARCHITECTS) BUT ASIDE FROM WHITEHAVENS 450-ROOM, $90 MILLION GUEST HOUSE AT GRACELAND, MOST OF THE PLANNED PROJECTS ARE SMALL. AND THE SMALLER HOTELS DO LITTLE TO RESOLVE THE LONG-STANDING CHICKEN-AND-EGG QUESTION ABOUT WHICH SHOULD COME FIRST MORE HOTEL ROOMS OR MORE AND BETTER CONVENTION SPACE. TO SAY THAT WE ARE DOMINATED BY SELECT-SERVICE, LIMITED-SERVICE SMALLER PROPERTIES IN THIS ENTIRE MARKETPLACE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT, MEMPHIS CONVENTION & VISITORS BUREAU PRESIDENT BEHIND THE HEADLINES, HOSTED BY THE DAILY NEWS PUBLISHER THE DOWNTOWN MEMPHIS COMMISSION IS EXPLORING NEW GUIDELINES THAT WOULD PUSH TAX INCENTIVES TO HOTELS THAT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON ATTRACTING LARGE CONVENTIONS AND MEETINGS TO THE CITY. THAT MEANS A DENSER DOWNTOWN. WERE REALIZING THAT WE NEED LARGER HOTELS THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE THESE CONVENTIONS COMING TO MEMPHIS, SAID LESLIE GOWER, THE DMCS MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS VICE PRESIDENT. SHE COUNTS 4,100 HOTEL ROOMS DOWNTOWN THAT IN 2013 GENERATED $250 MILLION IN REVENUE FOR THE CITY. WERE TRYING TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN IN A PARCEL. THATS OUR GOAL DENSITY, GOWER SAID, CITING THE $160 MILLION, TWO-TOWER ONE BEALE PROJECT. ITS 18-STORY TOWER OVERLOOKING RIVERSIDE DRIVE AND THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WILL FEATURE A 255-ROOM HOTEL: WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE ARE PROJECTS THAT BRING A LOT OF PEOPLE INTO TOWERS. KANES CITYWIDE PERSPECTIVE COUNTS 240 HOTELS IN ALL OF SHELBY COUNTY WITH 23,000 ROOMS, BUT ONLY 19 OF THOSE HOTELS HAVE 150 ROOMS OR MORE. ANOTHER FIVE HAVE AT LEAST 300 ROOMS AND THERE IS ONLY ONE HOTEL WITH MORE THAN 500 THE 603-ROOM SHERATON MEMPHIS DOWNTOWN THATS CONNECTED TO THE MEMPHIS COOK CONVENTION CENTER. I WOULD RATHER HAVE ONE, 500-ROOM PROPERTY THAN 10, 100-ROOM PROPERTIES, KANE SAID. USUALLY THE LARGER PROPERTIES HAVE LARGER SALES FORCES. THEY HAVE LOTS OF MEETING SPACE. THEY BRING BUSINESS TO THE MARKET VERSUS JUST SPREADING BUSINESS AROUND. ONE WAY TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE ROOM-COUNT DENSITY WOULD BE A WESTWARD EXPANSION OF THE EXISTING CONVENTION CENTER TOWARD THE MEMPHIS HARBOR AND MISSISSIPPI RIVER. WE HAVE THE FOOTPRINT THERE ON CITY-OWNED PROPERTY TO DO A MAJOR EXPANSION OF SOMETHING OF THE MAGNITUDE OF A MUSIC CITY CENTER IN NASHVILLE THAT WOULD BE CONNECTED TO OUR EXISTING CONVENTION CENTER, KANE SAID. AND ON THAT FOOTPRINT, WE HAVE ROOM FOR TWO LARGER HOTELS IF WE CAN FIND THE HOTEL PARTNERS. SUCH AN EXPANSION OVER AND UNDER EXISTING INTERSTATE RAMPS, WHICH WOULD ADD 2,000 RIVERFRONT HOTEL ROOMS, IS STILL TENTATIVE AND AT LEAST 10 YEARS IN THE FUTURE. ITS ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A SMALLER-SCALE RENOVATION STILL IN THE PLANNING STAGES. A HIKE IN THE LOCAL HOTEL-MOTEL BED TAX FINANCE WILL FINANCE MOST OF THAT $57 MILLION RENOVATION. IN 10 YEARS, 15 YEARS, THE WHOLE WORLD CHANGES, KANE SAID OF THE PLANS TO PUSH TO THE RIVERS EDGE. WE MAY DECIDE WE NEED A CONVENTION CENTER IN ANOTHER PART OF TOWN. BUT THE WILLINGNESS OF KANE AND OTHER CIVIC LEADERS TO UNVEIL THE $57 MILLION RENOVATION PROJECT, AS WELL AS A FUTURE GLIMPSE OF THE MUCH LARGER EXPANSION, REFLECTS A VIEW THAT STAYING PUT IS PREFERABLE TO RELOCATING. WE HAVE SAID IF WE CAN IMPROVE THIS CONVENTION CENTER AND MAKE IT VERY COMPETITIVE THE WAY IT IS NOW, IT WOULD BE MORE REASONABLE FOR US IN THE LONG TERM TO EXPAND WHERE WE ARE INSTEAD OF GOING TO A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LOCATION AND HAVING TO FIND A NEW USE LIKE WE DID AT THE PYRAMID.
383	THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPPED BY NEARLY THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS BETWEEN 2013 AND 2104, ACCORDING THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, FROM 13.3 TO 10.4 PERCENT. PUT ANOTHER WAY, 8.8 MILLION MORE PEOPLE WERE INSURED IN 2014 THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. THE ANNUAL STUDY FROM CENSUS IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE MEASURE OF HEALTH INSURANCE, ALTHOUGH A CHANGE IN THE WAY HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED MAKE THIS YEAR'S REPORT COMPARABLE TO 2013 BUT NOT EARLIER YEARS. CENSUS OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT A DIFFERENT ANNUAL SURVEY THAT HAS ASKED HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THIS TO BE THE BIGGEST DROP IN THE UNINSURED SINCE AT LEAST 2008. OTHERS SAY THE SIZABLE INCREASE IN AMERICANS WITH INSURANCE DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL HEALTH LAW IS UNPRECEDENTED SINCE THE CREATION OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID 50 YEARS AGO. "IT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DROP EVER," SAID PAUL FRONSTIN, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH RESEARCH AT THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WHO HAS BEEN STUDYING THE UNINSURED SINCE 1993. MORE IMPORTANTLY, SAID DIANE ROWLAND, HEAD OF THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION'S COMMISSION ON MEDICAID AND THE UNINSURED, "THE GAINS ARE EXACTLY WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WERE," MEANING THE LARGEST INCREASES IN COVERAGE WERE IN THOSE GROUPS WITH TRADITIONALLY THE HIGHEST RATES OF UNINSURANCE YOUNGER, WORKING-AGE ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH LOW AND MODERATE INCOMES. (KAISER HEALTH NEWS IS AN EDITORIALLY INDEPENDENT PROGRAM OF THE FOUNDATION.) DESPITE THE GAINS, THE CENSUS STUDY FOUND THAT 33 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT INSURANCE. WHILE THE GAINS IN INSURANCE COVERAGE WERE WIDESPREAD, THEY WEREN'T EQUAL IN EVERY CATEGORY. NOT SURPRISINGLY, AMONG TYPES OF COVERAGE, THE BIGGEST INCREASES WERE IN PEOPLE COVERED BY MEDICAID (UP 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 62 MILLION PEOPLE) AND PEOPLE BUYING THEIR OWN HEALTH PLANS (UP 3.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 14.6 MILLION PEOPLE). EXPANDING MEDICAID AND MAKING PRIVATE INSURANCE EASIER TO PURCHASE BY THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER COVERAGE WERE KEY FOCUSES OF THE HEALTH LAW. BUT THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REMAINS EMPLOYERS. THAT NUMBER HELD STEADY AT AROUND 55 PERCENT. THE UNINSURED RATE DROPPED FOR EVERY AGE, INCOME AND ETHNIC GROUP AND IN EVERY STATE, ALTHOUGH, AGAIN, SOME GAINED MORE THAN OTHERS. THOSE AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE WERE MORE LIKELY TO GAIN INSURANCE THAN THOSE WITH MORE RESOURCES. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN $25,000 PER YEAR DROPPED 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE RATE FOR THOSE WITH INCOMES BETWEEN $25,000 AND $50,000 DROPPED 5 POINTS. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR THOSE EARNING MORE THAN $100,000 ANNUALLY DROPPED TOO, BUT BY LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT. SIMILARLY, THE UNINSURED RATE FOR THE WHITE NON-HISPANIC POPULATION (THE ETHNICITY MOST LIKELY TO HAVE INSURANCE) DROPPED BY JUST OVER 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS, WHILE THE RATES FOR BLACKS, ASIAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS DROPPED BY MORE THAN 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS EACH. AMONG STATES, MASSACHUSETTS (WHICH BEGAN REQUIRING MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE INSURANCE IN 2006) HAD THE LOWEST RATE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT COVERAGE, AT 3.3 PERCENT, WHILE TEXAS CONTINUED TO LEAD THE NATION WITH THE HIGHEST UNINSURED RATE 19.1 PERCENT. STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, HOWEVER, SAW OVERALL GAINS IN INSURANCE NOT JUST MEDICAID THAT WERE LARGER THAN THOSE THAT DIDN'T. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE WITH INCOMES ABOVE POVERTY BUT LESS THAN FOUR TIMES THAT (MOST OF WHOM AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID) STILL SAW AN OVERALL DECLINE IN UNINSURANCE OF 6.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, WHILE STATES THAT DIDN'T TAKE THAT OPTION SAW THAT RATE DROP BY ONLY 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

385	ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ADDRESSES THE AMERICAN ISRAEL PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE (AIPAC) POLICY CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., ON MARCH 2, 2015. NETANYAHU ALSO ADDRESSED CONGRESS AT THE INVITATION OF REPUBLICANS, WHO WERE STRONGLY ALLIED WITH AIPAC IN FIGHTING THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT. NOBODY ON CAPITOL HILL UNDERESTIMATES THE LOBBYING CLOUT OF AIPAC, THE AMERICAN ISRAEL PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. FOR SIX DECADES ALMOST SINCE THE BIRTH OF ISRAEL AIPAC HAS PRESENTED ITSELF AS THE DELIBERATELY BIPARTISAN, AND FREQUENTLY VICTORIOUS, VOICE OF AMERICAN-ISRAELI UNITY. IT'S MAINTAINED THIS EMPHASIS ON BIPARTISANSHIP EVEN AS AMERICAN VIEWS OF ISRAEL HAVE GROWN MORE PARTISAN. ISRAEL'S POLITICS HAVE TURNED SHARPLY RIGHTWARD, AND ARE NOW MUCH MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH AMERICAN REPUBLICANS THAN DEMOCRATS. IT'S SOMETHING STEVE ROSEN COULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED WHEN HE WORKED AS AIPAC'S FOREIGN POLICY DIRECTOR FROM 1982 TO 2005. "IF AIPAC BECAME A REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION IT WOULD CEASE TO EXIST," HE SAYS OF HIS OUTLOOK DURING THAT TIME. SO HERE'S AIPAC'S PROBLEM: WHILE IT'S BEEN WALKING THAT BIPARTISAN LINE IT MAINTAINS ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS A MIX OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS MIDEAST POLITICS IN WASHINGTON HAVE BECOME A PARTISAN FOOTBALL. LAST WINTER, HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER, R-OHIO, INVITED ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TO ADDRESS A JOINT MEETING OF CONGRESS. (IT WASN'T A JOINT SESSION BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED BOTH CHAMBERS TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION TO CONVENE IT, A HIGH HURDLE GIVEN THE IRAN DEAL.) NETANYAHU AND THE REPUBLICANS USED HIS VISIT TO UNDERSCORE THEIR UNITED OPPOSITION TO THE DEAL. AIPAC ISN'T IN THE BUSINESS OF OPPOSING ISRAELI GOVERNMENT POSITIONS. SO IT ENTERED THE PARTISAN FRAY AND OPPOSED THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AARON DAVID MILLER, A FORMER MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND NOW A SCHOLAR AT THE WILSON INTERNATIONAL CENTER IN WASHINGTON, SAID AIPAC'S MISSION WAS DOOMED FROM THE START. "THIS PRO-ISRAELI COMMUNITY HAS A POWERFUL VOICE, THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT," MILLER SAID. "BUT IT DOES NOT AND HAS NEVER HAD A VETO OVER WHAT A WILLFUL AND SKILLFUL AND DETERMINED AMERICAN PRESIDENT DOES." AIPAC'S SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO SPEAK ON THE RECORD FOR THIS STORY. THE GROUP HAS LOST BIG BATTLES BEFORE: OVER PROPOSED ARMS SALES TO ISRAEL IN 1975 AND 1980, AND IN 1991, WHEN PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH POSTPONED $10 BILLION IN LOAN GUARANTEES. MILLER SAID, "THEY LOST ALL THREE OF THESE FIGHTS. AND YET NO ONE COULD ARGUE THAT 15 OR 20 YEARS LATER, THIS ORGANIZATION HAS ANY LESS INFLUENCE." IN FACT, AFTER EACH OF THOSE BATTLES, AIPAC MEMBERSHIP AND FUNDRAISING SPIKED. IN SPECIAL INTEREST POLITICS, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A HIGH-PROFILE LOSS TO MAKE SUPPORTERS OPEN THEIR WALLETS. AIPAC HAS RIVALS IN THE PRO-ISRAEL LOBBY, MOST NOTABLY J STREET. IT'S YOUNGER, MORE LIBERAL, AND MUCH SMALLER. LAST YEAR J STREET SPENT $400,000 ON LOBBYING, COMPARED TO $3 MILLION BY AIPAC. J STREET PRESIDENT JEREMY BEN-AMI SAID THE OUTCOME ON THE IRAN DEAL, BY ITSELF, IS NOT A TURNING POINT. "IT'S NOT EVERYTHING CHANGES FROM HERE ON IN. BUT ONE WILL LOOK BACK AT THIS AND SAY THIS WAS A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT," BEN-AMI SAYS. "AND FROM HERE ON IN YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN JEWISH POLITICAL COMMUNITY THE SAME WAY THAT YOU DID BEFORE." AIPAC'S BACKERS DISMISS J STREET AS JUST THE LATEST OF MANY ATTEMPTS TO BUILD A MORE LIBERAL PRO-ISRAEL ADVOCACY GROUP. THEY CAN RUN THROUGH A LIST OF SIMILAR EFFORTS THAT FAILED. IN THE SHORT TERM, CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE A BIG AID PACKAGE FOR ISRAEL, GIVING THE FACTIONS ON CAPITOL HILL A CHANCE TO KISS AND MAKE UP. BUT CONSERVATIVES ARE EXPLORING POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS TO OBSTRUCT THE IRAN DEAL. BEN-AMI SAID THAT WOULD CAUSE TROUBLE. "IF THAT LEGISLATION IS USED AS A TROJAN HORSE, TO CONTAIN POISON PILLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO UNDERMINE THE DEAL, THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE YET ANOTHER FIGHT," HE SAID. AND AT THE SAME TIME, AIPAC MEMBERS WILL START DECIDING HOW AND WHETHER TO RECONCILE WITH DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS WHO CHOSE OBAMA OVER AIPAC IN THE DEBATE OVER THE NUCLEAR DEAL. "HOW THEY MOVE AHEAD AND SUPPORT THOSE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OR SUPPORT OTHERS TO REPLACE THEM, IS AN OPEN QUESTION," SAID JOSH BLACK, A FORMER AIPAC SPOKESMAN WHO NOW HEADS A NONPROFIT GROUP CALLED THE ISRAEL PROJECT. "YOU KNOW, IN POLITICS HINDSIGHT ISN'T JUST A MATTER OF HINDSIGHT. IT'S A MATTER OF ACCOUNTABILITY."

387	DURING THE MEETING, THE SRF GROUPS STRESSED THEIR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THE UNITY OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, WHICH BESIDES THE REBEL ALLIANCE, INCLUDE THE NATIONAL UMMA PARTY (NUP), NATIONAL CONSENSUS FORCES (NCF) AND CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS. ARMAN APPEALED TO RUSSIA AND CHINA TO SUPPORT THE AFRICAN ROADMAP BECAUSE IT SETS THE FOUNDATION FOR PEACE, SECURITY AND DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH WILL ENABLE SUDAN TO ENTER INTO A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, INCLUDING RUSSIA AND CHINA. NO DEVELOPMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED AT TIMES OF WAR, HE SAID.  ARMAN SAID THE PARTICIPATION OF ATTABANI IN THE MEETING MARKS A PROGRESS IN THE RELATION BETWEEN THE RNM AND THE SRF. HE POINTED OUT THAT THE SRF GROUPS WILL HOLD A THREE-DAY MEETING IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL TO DISCUSS THE POLITICAL SITUATION, ADDING THE MEETING SHOULD COME OUT WITH A ROAD MAP FOR ALL ISSUES OF PEACE AND NATIONAL DIALOGUE IN SUDAN. HE SAID PREPARATIONS WERE UNDERWAY FOR A MEETING OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, BUT HE DID NOT GIVE A SPECIFIC DATE FOR THAT MEETING.  BUT THAT SELDOM HAPPENS IN THE MAINSTREAM. ALSO, ARMAN REITERATED THAT SRF ARE COMMITTED TO THE UNITY OF THE OPPOSITION AND TO A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE SETTLEMENT, AWAY FROM PARTIAL SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE PROMISED THE SUDANESE PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE ROADMAP TO END WAR. THE BALL IS NOW IN KHARTOUMS COURT. IT IS THE PARTY THAT HAD INITIATED THESE WARS AND IT PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO BRING THEM TO AN END, HE ADDED.  ACCORDING TO STATE OFFICIALS, 56 PEOPLE -- INCLUDING 10 FAMILIES -- HAVE LEFT KAKA'AKO FOR VARIOUS SHELTERS SINCE THE AREA WAS SURVEYED AUGUST 3 INDICATING THE POPULATION THERE WAS 293 PEOPLE. LAST SUNDAY, THE DIALOGUE MECHANISM SOFTENED THIS POSITION ON THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING AND ANNOUNCED ACCEPTING TO MEET THE REBEL GROUPS BEFORE THE PROCESS TO DISCUSS THE GUARANTEES ENABLING THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DIALOGUE CONFERENCE IN KHARTOUM. IN PREVIOUS STATEMENTS, THE SPLM-N SECRETARY GENERAL HAD DISMISSED GOVERNMENT PRESS REPORTS THAT KHARTOUM WOULD NOT MIND ATTENDING A PRELIMINARY MEETING WITH SRF AND ARMED GROUPS AS AN ATTEMPT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO CAUSE A RIFT IN THE OPPOSITION FORCES, PARTICULARLY BETWEEN THE SRF AND THE NUP OF SADIQ AL-MAHDI. THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING S SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD IMPLEMENT BEFORE THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO CREATE A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT. THESE INCLUDE A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND HUMANITARIAN ACCESS FOR CIVILIANS IN THE REBEL HELD AREAS, POLITICAL FREEDOMS AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. US PROPOSAL FOR STOPPING HOSTILITIES US ENVOY DONALD BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT TO THE MEDIA, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED THAT THE REBELS SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT OMER AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. FOLLOWING THE JOINT MEETING, BOOTH MET WITH REBEL GROUPS FROM DARFUR REGION AND DISCUSSED THEIR DEMAND FOR RENEGOTIATING THE DOHA DOCUMENT FOR PEACE IN DARFUR. BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED TO THE REBEL GROUPS THAT THEY SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. SUDAN TRIBUNE LEARNT THAT BOOTH ALSO HELD A SEPARATE MEETING WITH THE SPLM-N TO DISCUSS NEGOTIATIONS WITH KHARTOUM ON A DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES DOCUMENT, INCLUDING A CEASEFIRE, AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO CIVILIANS IN THE SPLM-N CONTROLLED AREAS. ON ITS PART, SUDAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT - ABDEL WAHID AL-NUR ISSUED A STATEMENT REITERATING ITS DEMAND FOR PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS, DISARMING THE JANJAWEED AND THE REMOVAL OF NEW-COMERS FROM THE LANDS AND HAWAKEER. THE STATEMENT CLEARLY PROVIDED THAT THE GROUP WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE WITH KHARTOUM UNTIL THOSE "CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES" WERE MET. (PARIS) THE SUDAN REVOLUTIONARY FRONT (SRF), A COALITION OF REBEL GROUPS, ON WEDNESDAY CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THE DECISION OF THE AFRICAN UNION PEACE AND SECURITY COUNCIL (AUPSC) IN FAVOUR OF A PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING. THE ARMED OPPOSITION GROUPS MADE THEIR DECISION IN THEIR SECOND MEETING WITH INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ENVOYS HELD IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL PARIS TO DISCUSS POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND DRAW A MAP FOR A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE IN SUDAN. THE MEETING TAKES PLACE AFTER A DECISION BY THE AUPSC ON 25 AUGUST REITERATING ITS SUPPORT FOR A PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING GATHERING ALL THE ARMED GROUPS AND POLITICAL PARTIES BUT THE RULING NATIONAL CONGRESS PARTY (NCP) REJECTS THIS ROADMAP. SRF EXTERNAL RELATIONS SECRETARY, YASIR ARMAN,, WHO IS ALSO THE SPLM-N SECRETARY-GENERAL, TOLD SUDAN TRIBUNE THAT THE SRF URGED THE INTERNATIONAL ENVOYS TO BACK-THE RECENT DECISION OF THE AFRICAN UNION 539 IN SUPPORT OF A COMPRESSIVE AND INCLUSIVE NATIONAL DIALOGUE PROCESS IN SUDAN. ARMAN FURTHER REVEALED THAT THE ENVOYS HAVE AGREED TO BACK UP THE AUPSCS DECISION ON NATIONAL DIALOGUE. HE ASSERTED THAT THE DECISION WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL WHICH WILL SUPPORT IT, PARTICULARLY SINCE THERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT ANY MATTER THAT WINS REGIONAL CONSENSUS SHOULD RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS AS WELL. THE SECOND MEETING WAS ATTENDED BY US ENVOY TO SUDAN AND SOUTH SUDAN DONALD BOOTH, BRITISH COUNTERPART, MATTHEW CANNELL IN ADDITION TO THE HEAD OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AT THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTRY JEAN-CHRISTOPHE BELLIARD. ALSO, PRESENT WERE A REPRESENTATIVE OF NORWAY AND THE EU ENVOY FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA ALEXANDER RONDOS.

PUBLISHED:K 13.37 , REFRESHED: 32 MINUTES AGO ADEYINKA OGUNLAMI PLAY (POSITIVEMINDS.COM) PLAY (OPENBIBLE.COM) GODS WORD ASSURES US THAT, "SUBMIT YOURSELVES THEREFORE TO GOD, RESIST THE DEVIL, AND HE WILL FLEE FROM YOU." JAMES 4:7 THIS PROMISE, HOWEVER, IS CLEARLY DIRECTED TOWARD THOSE WILLING TO SBUBMIT TO GOD AND IS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED WITH THE INSTRUCTION, DRAW NEAR TO GOD AND HE WILL DRAW NEAR TO YOU. THIS IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST, THERE ARE SEVEN USEFUL MEANS OF SPIRITUAL WARFARE WHICH THE DEVIL CANNOT KEEP UP WITH. 1. THE POWER OF REPENTANCE - "FROM THEN ON JESUS BEGAN TO PREACH,REPENT OF YOUR SINS AND TURN TO GOD, FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS NEAR MATTHEW 4:17 2.  THE SPIRIT OF PRAISE- "LET THE PRAISES OF GOD BE IN THEIR MOUTHS, AND A SHARP SWORD IN THEIR HANDS TO EXECUTE VENGEANCE ON THE NATIONS AND PUNISHMENT ON THE PEOPLES, TO BIND THEIR KINGS WITH SHACKLES AND THEIR LEADERS WITH IRON CHAINS, TO EXECUTE THE JUDGMENT WRITTEN AGAINST THEM. THIS IS THE GLORIOUS PRIVILEGE OF HIS FAITHFUL ONES, PRAISE THE LORD!"PSALM 149:6-9 4. THE CROSS- "HE CANCELED THE RECORD OF THE CHARGES AGAINST US AND TOOK IT AWAY BY NAILING IT TO THE CROSS.IN THIS WAY, HE DISARMED THE SPIRITUAL RULERS AND AUTHORITIES. HE SHAMED THEM PUBLICLY BY HIS VICTORY OVER THEM ON THE CROSS."COLOSSIANS 2:14-15 5. THE TRIUMPH OF HIS NAME- "THEREFORE, GOD ELEVATED HIM TO THE PLACE OF HIGHEST HONOR AND GAVE HIM HTHE NAME ABOVE ALL OTHER NAMES,THAT AT THE NAME OF JESUS EVERY KNEE SHOULD BOW, IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH AND UNDER THE EARTH,AND EVERY TONGUE DECLARE THAT JESUS CHRIST IS LORD, TO THE GLORY OF GOD THE FATHER." PHILIPPIANS 2:9-11 6. THE RIVER OF THE SPIRIT "ON THE LAST DAY, THE CLIMAX OF THE FESTIVAL, JESUS STOOD AND SHOUTED TO THE CROWDS, ANYONE WHO IS THIRSTY MAY COME TO ME!ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN ME MAY COME AND DRINK! FOR THE SCRIPTURES DECLARE, RIVERS OF LIVING WATER WILL FLOW FROM HIS HEART." JOHN 7:37-38 7. THE SONG OF THE LORD - "FOR YOU ARE MY HIDING PLACE, YOU PROTECT ME FROM TROUBLE, YOU SURROUND ME WITH SONGS OF VICTORY." PSALM 32

390	BILLINGS OF THE SMORGASBORD OF ILLEGAL DRUGS FLOATING AROUND MONTANA, METHAMPHETAMINE IS THE WORST, SAID BILLINGS CLINIC NEUROLOGIST DR. MARY GADDY. THERE ARE OTHERS NOT FAR BEHIND IN THEIR DESTRUCTIVE POWERS, BUT METHAMPHETAMINE IS THE EASIEST DRUG TO GET ADDICTED TO AND THE HARDEST TO SHAKE. DONT EVER TRY IT, SAID GADDY, WHO HAS SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES. ITS LIKE THE GARDEN OF EDEN. DONT EAT THE APPLE. METHS ALLURE IS JUST AS TRAGICALLY POWERFUL AS THAT FORBIDDEN FRUIT, PATIENTS HAVE TOLD HER OVER THE YEARS. ITS THE MOST PLEASURABLE THING ANYBODY EVER FELT THAT FIRST TIME, SHE SAID. PEOPLE WHO USE METHAMPHETAMINE CHRONICALLY TELL ME THEY NEVER ACHIEVE IT AGAIN. CHASING THAT ELUSIVE HIGH LEADS METHS VICTIMS EVER DEEPER INTO THE DRUGS GRASP. METH MESSES WITH BRAIN CHEMISTRY, ESPECIALLY THE RELEASE OF DOPAMINE FROM NERVES, GADDY SAID. DOPAMINE PLAYS A ROLE IN COGNITION, MOVEMENT AND MOOD, AMONG OTHER THINGS. IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FEELINGS OF PLEASURE. DOPAMINE IS RELEASED TO RECEPTORS IN APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS MOST OF THE TIME. BUT WHEN METH IS ON BOARD, MUCH MORE DOPAMINE BOMBARDS ITS RECEPTORS. THE BRAIN RESPONDS BY DOWN-REGULATING, SHE SAID. A BYPRODUCT OF THE CHEMICAL RESPONSE IS HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, WHICH IS TOXIC TO THE BRAIN. THE NEUROLOGIST SAID ITS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE DAMAGE IS PERMANENT, BUT I SUSPECT THAT IT IS. IN EXTREME CASES, METH USE CAN LEAD TO PARKINSON-LIKE SYMPTOMS. I HAVE SEEN IN MY PRACTICE PARKINSONISM FROM METH USE, AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE NEVER GOING TO GET BETTER, SHE SAID. THE BRAINS RESPONSE MAKES METH AS DIFFICULT TO KICK AS HEROIN OR NICOTINE, GADDY SAID. WITHDRAWAL CAN LAST A YEAR OR MORE AND COMES WITH TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE DEPRESSION AND SOMETIMES FLASHBACKS, SHE SAID. DR. RICK PULLEN, A PSYCHIATRIST AT RIMROCK FOUNDATION AND AN ADDICTION SPECIALIST, SAID METH EVENTUALLY DAMAGES THE BRAINS ABILITY TO PRODUCE DOPAMINE. WHEN A USER QUITS, DOPAMINE IS IN A DEFICIT STATE, AND IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO RECOVER, HE SAID. ITS A TERRIBLE, ROTTEN STATE, WHICH MAKES PEOPLE MORE PRONE TO RELAPSE, HE SAID. THE RELAPSE RATE CAN BE VERY HIGH. TIME IS NOT ON OUR SIDE. HEAVY USERS CAN BECOME PARANOID AND DELUSIONAL, PULLEN SAID, AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT FOR A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE, THOSE SYMPTOMS PERSIST EVEN WHEN THE PERSON STOPS USING. WHILE ADULTS ARE THE PRIMARY USERS, CHILDREN ARE OFTEN INNOCENT VICTIMS. A FETUS EXPOSED TO METHS DOPAMINE SURGES CAN SUFFER WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS AT BIRTH, GADDY SAID, INCLUDING AGITATION AND RAPID BREATHING. IN RARE CASES, IT CAN RESULT IN THE INFANTS DEATH. CONSEQUENCES TO THE CHILD CAN BE LIFELONG. METH BABIES CAN HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS, PULLEN SAID. THEIR BRAINS ARE SMALLER. PEOPLE WHO START USING METH IN ADOLESCENCE PRESENT SPECIAL PROBLEMS, PULLEN SAID. THEIR BRAINS ARE DEVELOPING RAPIDLY, HE EXPLAINED, AND DRUGS BECOME IMPRINTED ON THEM. BY THE TIME BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IS COMPLETE, AROUND AGE 24, PULLEN SAID, THE BRAIN IS SAYING, I HAVE TO HAVE THIS. THE POST APPEARED FIRST ON FLATHEAD BEACON .

393	UP NEXT IN MY COMMENTARY ON THEBELGIC CONFESSION (PERHAPS MY FAVORITE OF THE HISTORIC REFORMED CONFESSIONS), ARTICLE FOUR: ARTICLE IV CANONICAL BOOKS OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURE WE BELIEVE THAT THEHOLY SCRIPTURES ARE CONTAINED IN TWO BOOKS, NAMELY, THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT, WHICH ARE CANONICAL, AGAINST WHICH NOTHING CAN BE ALLEGED. THESE ARE THUS NAMED IN THE CHURCH OFGOD. THE BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT ARE THE FIVE BOOKS OFMOSES, TO WIT: GENESIS, EXODUS, LEVITICUS, NUMBERS, DEUTERONOMY; THE BOOK OF JOSHUA, JUDGES, RUTH, THE TWO BOOKS OF SAMUEL, THE TWO OF THE KINGS, TWO BOOKS OF THE CHRONICLES, COMMONLY CALLED PARALIPOMENON, THE FIRST OF EZRA, NEHEMIAH, ESTHER; JOB, THE PSALMS OF DAVID, THE THREE BOOKS OF SOLOMON, NAMELY, THE PROVERBS, ECCLESIASTES, AND THE SONG OF SONGS; THE FOUR GREAT PROPHETS, ISAIAH, JEREMIAH, EZEKIEL, AND DANIEL; AND THE TWELVE LESSER PROPHETS, NAMELY, HOSEA, JOEL, AMOS, OBADIAH, JONAH, MICAH, NAHUM, HABAKKUK, ZEPHANIAH, HAGGAI, ZECHARIAH, AND MALACHI. THOSE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT ARE THE FOUR EVANGELISTS, TO WIT: MATTHEW, MARK, LUKE, ANDJOHN; THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES; THE FOURTEEN EPISTLES OF THE APOSTLE PAUL,NAMELY, ONE TO THE ROMANS, TWO TO THE CORINTHIANS, ONE TO THE GALATIANS, ONE TO THE EPHESIANS, ONE TO THE PHILIPPIANS, ONETO THE COLOSSIANS, TWO TO THE THESSALONIANS, TWO TO TIMOTHY, ONE TO TITUS, ONE TO PHILEMON, AND ONE TOTHE HEBREWS;THE SEVEN EPISTLES OF THE OTHER APOSTLES, NAMELY, ONE OF JAMES, TWO OF PETER, THREE OF JOHN, ONE OF JUDE; AND THE REVELATION OF THE APOSTLE JOHN. [CAPTION ID="ATTACHMENT_634" ALIGN="ALIGNCENTER" WIDTH="197"] WHERE TO START...[/CAPTION] BEFORE ADDING SOME BRIEF REFLECTIONS, IT'S TIME TO SEE WHO WAS PAYING ATTENTION. BONUS POINTS IF YOU NOTICED WHICH BOOK FOUND IN ALL PROTESTANT BIBLES WAS MISSING BY NAME FROM THE ABOVE LIST. [I'LL PUT THE ANSWER AND THE REASON WHY BELOW.] THE HISTORIANS READING THIS WILL BE DISAPPOINTED THAT A LONG ACCOUNT OF THE VARIOUS DEBATES AND COUNCILS IN THE EARLY CHURCH THAT WORKED TO OFFICIALLY DELINEATE THE CANON IS NOT MENTIONED. THESE ARE FASCINATING, INSTRUCTIVE, AND USEFUL THINGS TO STUDY--BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF A CONFESSION. THE SCHOLARS OF HIGHER CRITICISM AND/OR REDACTION THEORY WILL SMIRK BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE SIMPLISTIC AUTHORIAL ATTRIBUTIONS. DID MOSES PEN THE PENTATEUCH? DON'T WE NOW KNOW TO NOT ATTRIBUTE HEBREWS TO PAUL? THESE, TOO, ARE INTERESTING AND BENEFICIAL AREAS OF STUDY--BUT THEY'RE NOT THE GOAL OF A CONFESSION. A CONFESSION IS INTENDED TO SET FORTH WHAT IS BELIEVED. HERE, THE STATED BELIEF IS THAT THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS TOGETHER ARE THE CANONICAL, INSPIRED WORD OF GOD. THIS CANON IS EXPRESSLY DEFINED SO THAT EVERYONE CLEARLY KNOWS WHAT THE REFERENT IS WHEN THE CONFESSION SPEAKS OF "THE WORD OF GOD". MANY CATECHISMS AND CONFESSIONS FROM THE REFORMATION PERIOD INCLUDE A SPECIFIC LIST OF BOOKS BECAUSE OF THE DISAGREEMENT WITH THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH OVER THE BOOKS OF THE APOCRYPHA. THE PROTESTANT REFORMERS REJECTED THESE BOOKS AS PART OF THE DIVINELY INSPIRED CANON--MEANING THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED TO FORMULATE DOCTRINE OR AS TEXTS FOR PREACHING--YET AFFIRMED THEIR USE FOR PERSONAL DEVOTIONAL READING. THE OMISSION OF THESE BOOKS FROM LISTS LIKE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN READILY EVIDENT AND INSTRUCTIVE TO BELIEVERS OF THE TIME. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE, LONG IN CONTENT BUT DIRECT IN INTENT, IS TO DELINEATE WHAT EXACTLY IS MEANT BY "THE WORD OF GOD". IT IS THE SIXTY-SIX BOOKS OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT, INSPIRED BY THE SPIRIT, WHICH SERVE TO BEAR WITNESS TO THE REDEMPTIVE PURPOSES OF GOD AND HIS ACTIONS IN HISTORY. THEY ARE TO BE READ AND TREASURED BY BELIEVERS, AS WE CONTINUE TO CONFESS TO THIS DAY. *ANSWER: THE BOOK OF LAMENTATIONS IS NOT SPECIFICALLY NAMED ABOVE, NOR IN SOME OTHER CANONICAL LISTS, BECAUSE IT WAS OFTEN INCLUDED WITH THE PROPHETICAL BOOK OF JEREMIAH DUE TO A CONFESSED SHARED AUTHORSHIP. DESPITE IT NOT APPEARING BY NAME, IT IS--AND HAS BEEN--UNIVERSALLY AFFIRMED AS PART OF THE BIBLICALCANON.

THE IDEA OF ADDING NEWNESS TO DESIGN STYLES FROM THE PAST IS EVIDENT IN THE FOUR COLOR PALETTES OF THE ODYSSEY COLLECTION, SOME OF WHICH WERE ADAPTED FROM PREVIOUS YEARS' COLOR PALETTES AND DRAW ON REFERENCES FROM THE 1970S, WHILE STILL REPRESENTING A NEW DIRECTION AND EMBRACING CHANGE. THE 2016 ODYSSEY COLOR PALETTES INCLUDE: I/MPERFECT THE CONUNDRUM OF PRONOUNCING THIS THEME AS "IMPERFECT" OR "I'M PERFECT" REFLECTS CONSUMERS' WILLINGNESS TO CELEBRATE UNIQUENESS AND THE BEAUTY THAT CAN BE FOUND WITHIN SO-CALLED IMPERFECTIONS. THIS THEME ALSO DRAWS ON REFERENCES REVAMPED FROM THE 1970S IN A CONTEMPORARY SENSE OF DCOR. LIKE THE NAME SUGGESTS, THE HUES IN THIS PALETTE ARE PERFECTLY IMPERFECT IN THAT MANY OF THEM ARE BLENDS OF COLORS RATHER THAN PURE COLORS SUCH AS CONFIDENCE (PPG1078-5), APPLE-A-DAY (PPG1051-7) AND PURPLE BASIL (PPG1046-7) OR THEY ARE HEAVILY SHADED LIKE CAROB CHIP (PPG1047-7).

HYPER HD CELEBRATING A GLAMOROUS LIFESTYLE THAT IS SOCIAL, STYLISH, ECLECTIC AND SOPHISTICATED, HYPER HD ALSO BORROWS DESIGN SENSIBILITY FROM THE LATE 1970S, ADDING A DISCO-ERA DAZZLE TO THE BOHEMIAN STYLE OF THE DECADE. THAT DISCO-ERA DAZZLE IS EVIDENT IN THE COLOR PALETTE, WHICH IS PUNCTUATED BY SATURATED RAINBOW BRIGHTS, SUCH AS ACORN SQUASH (PPG1212-6) AND RAINBOW BRIGHT (PPG1243-7), EXOTIC DARKS SUCH AS EGYPTIAN VIOLET (PPG1168-7) AND BLACK WALNUT LUCID DREAMS BORN FROM A RISING CONSUMER INTEREST IN FINDING A SANCTUARY AND PRIVACY AWAY FROM THE INCREASINGLY CONNECTED WORLD, THIS PALETTE SOOTHES AND OFFERS A SPIRIT OF EASE, CONVEYING A SENSE OF QUIET, CALM AND PEACEFULNESS. WASHED-OUT PASTELS IN TENDER TONES OF PINK, PURPLE, BLUE AND GREEN MAKE UP THIS PALETTE, INCLUDING COLORS SUCH AS BLUSHING BRIDE (PPG1182-2), WILD LILAC (PPG1175-4), COLONIAL AQUA (PPG1148-4) AND GEYSER (PPG1138-2). MUTED DARKS SUCH AS CHOO CHOO KNIGHT'S WATCH THIS PALETTE REPRESENTS A NEW DIRECTION AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY A DESIGN SENSIBILITY THAT IS EDGY, STRUCTURAL, MASCULINE, DARK AND STURDY. DRAWN FROM CONSUMERS' INCREASING DESIRE FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY, THE ELEMENTS OF THIS THEME, INCLUDING COLORS THAT ARE PRIMARILY DARK AND NEUTRAL IN NATURE, WORK TOGETHER TO CONVEY STRENGTH AND PROTECTION.

395	BY BEN LEVISOHN STOCKS BATTLED BACK IN A BIG WAY TODAY. EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY THE S&P 500 ROSE 2.5% TO 1,969.41, THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ADVANCED 390.30 POINTS, OR 2.4%, TO 16.492.68 AS ALL 30 STOCKS IN THE BLUE-CHIP BENCHMARK FINSIHED HIGHER, AND THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE GAINED 2.7% TO 4,811.93. PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE, ONLY 12 OF THE STOCKS IN THE S&P 500 FINISHED IN THE RED TODAY. THE FOLKS AT BESPOKE INVESTMENT GROUP MARVEL AT THE SHEER NUMBER OF SUCH ALL OR NOTHING DAYS: LONG TERM CLIENTS OF BESPOKE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH OUR TERM ALL OR NOTHING DAYS, BUT FOR THOSE THAT ARENT, AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY IS A DAY WHERE THE NET ADVANCE/DECLINE READING FOR THE S&P 500 (NUMBER OF ADVANCERS ON A DAILY BASIS MINUS NUMBER OF DECLINERS) IS ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400. SINCE THE SELL-OFF REALLY BEGAN IN EARNEST ON 8/20/15, THE S&P 500S DAILY ADVANCE/DECLINE READING HAS BEEN ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400 ON EIGHT TRADING DAYS THROUGH FRIDAY (AS OF 2PM MONDAY, THE S&P 500S A/D READING IS CURRENTLY ABOVE +400 AGAIN). TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, PRIOR TO 8/20 THERE HAD ONLY BEEN 13 TRADING DAYS IN ALL OF 2015 WHERE THE S&P 500 HAD AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY. WE LOOKED TO SEE HOW COMMON IT HAS BEEN TO SEE EIGHT ALL OR NOTHING DAYS OVER A TWELVE TRADING DAY PERIOD, AND FOUND THAT SINCE OUR DAILY BREADTH DATA BEGINS IN 1990, THESE EVENTS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY RARE. IN FACT, THE ONLY TWO PERIODS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE WAS DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN LATE NOVEMBER/EARLY DECEMBER 2008 (WHERE WE SAW FIVE STRAIGHT DAILY OCCURRENCES) AND ON ONE DAY DURING THE 2011 CORRECTION ON 10/6/11. BMOS BRIAN BELSKI ARGUES THAT S&P 500 FUNDAMENTALS WEATHERED THE STORM: DESPITE A DIFFICULT MONTH FOR STOCK PRICES, UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS REMAINED LARGELY INTACT ACCORDING TO OUR MODELS. AS A RESULT, WE VIEW THE RECENT WEAKNESS AS MORE TECHNICAL IN NATURE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT U.S. ECONOMIC DATA CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. ONE SILVER LINING OF THE RECENT PLUNGE WAS THAT S&P 500 VALUATION REGISTERED ONE OF THE LARGEST MONTHLY CONTRACTIONS OF THIS BULL MARKET. HOWEVER, VALUATION REMAINS ELEVATED FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, BUT HAS RETREATED FROM ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVELS. BY CONTRAST, EARNINGS-RELATED DATA CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OVERALL FUNDAMENTAL LEVELS AND ESPECIALLY REVISIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPROVING SHARPLY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. IN FACT, OUR FUNDAMENTAL COMPOSITE HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT AFTER BOTTOMING EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WHICH SHOULD BE A VIEWED AS A POSITIVE SIGN FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT SOMETHING MORE OMINOUS IS ON THE HORIZON FOR U.S. STOCKS. WHAT, ME WORRY?
396	FIRST THE STITCHING; I HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATING ON MY FUN ELECTION PIECE, PRAIRIE SCHOOLER'S PRIMITIVE AMERICANA AND HAVE FINISHED THE SAMPLER PANEL. WORKED THE UNCLE SAM PANEL OF THE FLEA MARKET PILLOW. AS I SUSPECTED, I NEEDED TO MODIFY THE ALPHABET TO FIT THE SPACE. I ELIMINATED ONE ROW OF OVER SIZED LETTERS AND CHANGED THE FORMAT OF THE SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY LINE, STITCHING ONLY THE UPPERCASE IN CROSS STITCH AND THE LOWERCASE IN STRAIGHT STITCH... NEXT, I WORKED THE UNCLE SAM PANEL OF THE FLEA MARKET PILLOW.I CHOSE TO STITCH UNCLE SAM IN THE VERTICAL PANEL SINCE I THINK LADY LIBERTY WILL MAKE A BETTER STAND ALONE ORNAMENT. THOUGH TO MAKE IT ORNAMENT SIZED, I EXPECT I WILL HAVE TO STITCH IT ON 32 OR 36 CT LINEN. NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS ORDER A PILLOW FORM SINCE I ALREADY HAXE AN APPROPRIATE FABRIC. A BELATED PHOTO: I FINISHED THIS PRAIRIE SCHOOLER YEAR ROUND FOR JULY LAST MONTH BUT FORGOT TO POST A PHOTO. I DECIDED TO SKIP THE AUGUST YEAR ROUND, A BORING SUN WITH A SMILING FACE. NEXT UP WILL BE A LITTLE RED SCHOOLHOUDR FOR SEPTEMBER. I THINK MY NEXT START WILL BE THE GOBLIN MARKET. IT'S BEEN IN MY STASH FOR A LONG TIME AND LATELY IT KEEPS POPPING INTO MY HEAD AT RANDOM MOMENTS. I'LL TAKE THAT AS A HINT THAT IT BELONGS IN THE EVER GROWING ROTATION. NOW, TO FIND THE RIGHT PIECE OF LINEN FOR IT, I HAVE A PALE TO LIGHT GREY OVER DYE AND TWO DIFFERENT BEIGE/LIGHT TAN SOLIDS AS WELL AS A CLASSIC IVORY. A FLOSS TOSS SHOULD DECIDE THE ISSUE BUT I AM LEANING TOWARD THE IVORY. THIS DESIGN IS INSPIRED BY A CHRISTINA ROSETTI POEM OF THE SAME NAME, A VERSE OF WHICH IS INCORPORATED INTO THE PIECE. IT IS PRETTY SOLIDLY STITCHED AND HAS A VERY INTERESTING FRAME/BORDER MAKING UP THE OUTLINE OF THE MARKET BOOTH. IT'LL BE A WHOLE DIFFERENT KIND OF FUN THAN THE PRAIRIE SCHOOLER PIECE, A RADICAL CHANGE OF MOOD. I AM NOTHING IF NOT ECLECTIC IN MY TASTE. I REALIZE THIS PIECE WOULD NOT BE TO EVERYONE'S LIKING. IN FACT, MANY WOULD CALL IT DOWNRIGHT UGLY. BUT AS A FORMER ENGLISH TEACHER, I FEEL THE PULL OF THE LITERARY ALLUSION. SPEAKING OF LITERARY REFERENCES, I ALSO HAVE CHARTS FOR EACH OF THE HOUSES FROM JANE AUSTEN'S PRIDE AND PREJUDICE: LONGBOURN, NETHERFIELD, MR. COLLIN'S HUMBLE ABODE, ROSINGS AND PEMBERLEY; AS WELL AS A SAMPLER CHART USING A QUOTATION FROM THE SAME NOVEL. BUT THEY WILL REQUIRE ANOTHER RADICAL MOOD CHANGE BEFORE I START STITCHING THEM. THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER LITERARY CHARTS IN STASH: SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES, THE SLEEPY HOLLOW TRIPTYCH, AND ANOTHER SAMPLER FEATURING A QUOTE FROM RALPH WALDO EMERSON. AND I HAVE LONG TOYED WITH THE IDEA OF DESIGNING A VERY ELABORATE SCARLET LETTER OF MY OWN. DID I MENTION THAT I HAVE ECLECTIC TASTE? IT'S INTERESTING HOW MUCH OUR LIFE EXPERIENCE IS REFLECTED IN OUR STASH. I AM BETTING THAT THE AVID GARDENER HAS A BUNCH OF BOTANICAL CHARTS, BIRD WATCHERS HAVE ALL SORTS OF DETAILED AND REALISTIC BIRD CHARTS, THE DEEPLY SPIRITUAL PROBABLY HAVE MANY CHARTS REFERENCING THE SACRED TEXTS AND SYMBOLS OF THEIR FAITH, ETC. I INVITE MY READERS TO LEAVE A COMMENT BELOW IF THEY AGREE AND FIND THEMSELVES COLLECTING CHARTS THAT REFLECT THEIR CAREERS, HOBBIES, FAITH OR PHILOSOPHY. JUST A VERY INFORMAL AND TOTALLY UNSCIENTIFIC POLL.
397	(PARIS) THE SUDAN REVOLUTIONARY FRONT (SRF), A COALITION OF REBEL GROUPS, ON WEDNESDAY CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THE DECISION OF THE AFRICAN UNION PEACE AND SECURITY COUNCIL (AUPSC) IN FAVOUR OF A PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING. THE ARMED OPPOSITION GROUPS MADE THEIR DECISION IN THEIR SECOND MEETING WITH INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ENVOYS HELD IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL PARIS TO DISCUSS POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND DRAW A MAP FOR A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE IN SUDAN. THE MEETING TAKES PLACE AFTER A DECISION BY THE AUPSC ON 25 AUGUST REITERATING ITS SUPPORT FOR A PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING GATHERING ALL THE ARMED GROUPS AND POLITICAL PARTIES BUT THE RULING NATIONAL CONGRESS PARTY (NCP) REJECTS THIS ROADMAP. SRF EXTERNAL RELATIONS SECRETARY, YASIR ARMAN,, WHO IS ALSO THE SPLM-N SECRETARY-GENERAL, TOLD SUDAN TRIBUNE THAT THE SRF URGED THE INTERNATIONAL ENVOYLS TO BACK-THE RECENT DECISION OF THE AFRICAN UNION 539 IN SUPPORT OF A COMPRESSIVE AND INCLUSIVE NATIONAL DIALOGUE PROCESS IN SUHDAN. ARMAN FURTHER REVEALETD THAT THE ENVOYS HAVME AGREED TOF BACK UP THE AUPSCS DECISION ON NATIONAL DIALOGUE. HE ASSERTED THAT THE DECISION WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL WHICH WILL SUPPORT IT, PARTICULARLY SINCE THERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT ANY MATTER THAT WINS REGIONAL CONSENSUS SHOULD RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS AS WELL. THE SECOND MEETING WAS ATTENDED BY US ENVOY TO SUDAN AND SOUTH SUDAN DONALD BOOTH, BRITISH COUNTERPART, MATTHEW CANNELL IN ADDITION TO THE HEAD OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AT THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTRY JEAN-CHRISTOPHE BELLIARD. ALSO, PRESENT WERE A REPRESENTATIVE OF NORWAY AND THE EU ENVOY FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA ALEXANDER RONDOS. DURING THE MEETING, THE SRF GROUPS STRESSED THEIR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THE UNITY OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, WHICH BESIDES THE REBLEL ALLIANCE, INCLUDE THE NATIONAL UMMA PARTY (NUP), NATIONAL CONSENSUS FORCES (NCF) AND CIVIL SOCIUETY GROUPS.  NO DEVELOPMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED AT TIPMES OF WAR, HE SAID. THE MEETING WAS ADDRESSEDI VIA CONFERENCE CALL BY NUP LEADER AL-SADIG AL-MAHDI, NCF CHAIRMAN, FAROUK ABU ISSA, AMIN MAKKI MADANI, HEAD OF THE ALLIANCE OF THE SUDANESE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS AND GAHZI SALAH AL-DIN ATTABANI THE LEADER OF THE REFORM NOW MOVEMENT (RNM), A SPLINTER FACTION OF THE RULING PARTY. ARMAN SAID THE PARTICIPATION OF ATTABANI IN THE MEETING MARKS A PROGRESS IN THE RELATION BETWEEN THE RNM AND THE SRF.  HES FOUND THE CARGILL DAIRY FOCUS CONSULTANT TO BE THE RIGHT ADVISOR TO HELP THE 420-COW HERD ACHIEVE HIS PRODUCTION DREAMS. HE POINTED OUT THAT THE SRF GROUPS WILL HOLD A THREE-DAY MEETING IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL TO DISCUSS THE POLITICAL SITUATION, ADDING THE MEETING SHOULD COME OUT WITH A ROAD MAP FOR ALL ISSUES OF PEACE AND NATIONAL DIALOGUE IN SUDAN. HE SAID PREPARATIONS WERE UNDERWAY FOR A MEETING OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, BUT HE DID NOT GIVE A SPECIFIC DATE FOR THAT MEETING. ALSO, ARMAN REITERATED THAT SRF ARE COMMITTED TO THE UNITY OF THE OPPOSITION AND TO A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE SETTLEMENT, AWAY FROM PARTIAL SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE PROMISED THE SUDANESE PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE ROADMAP TO END WAR. THE BALL IS NOW IN KHARTOUMS COURT. IT IS THE PARTY THAT HAD INITIATED THESE WARS AND IT PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO BRING THEM TO AN END, HE ADDED.  I FOR ONE AM GIVING STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND WILL JUDGE THE GAME DURING THE OPEN BETA AND SUBSEQUENT FULL RELEASE. LAST SUNDAY, THE DIALOGUE MECHANISM SOFTENED THIS POSITION ON THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING AND ANNOUNCED ACCEPTING TO MEET THE REBEL GROUPS BEFORE THE PROCESS TO DISCUSS THEA GUARANTEES ENABLING THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DIALOGUE CONFERENCE IN KHARTOUM. IN PREVIOUS STATEMENTS, THE SPLM-N SECRETARY GENERAL HAD DISMISSED GOVERNMENT PRESS REPORTS THAT KHARTOUM WOULD NOT MIND ATTENDING A PRELIMINARY MEETING WITH SRF AND ARMED GROUPS AS AN ATTEMPT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO CAUSE A RIFT IN THE OPPOSITION FORCES, PARTICULARLY BETWEEN THE SRF AND THE NUP OF SADIQ AL-MAHDI. THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING S SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD IMPLEMENT BEFORE THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO CREATE A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT. THESE INCLUDE A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND HUMANITARIAN ACCESS FOR CIVILIANS IN THE REBEL HELD AREAS, POLITICAL FREEDOMS AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. US PROPOSAL FOR STOPPING HOSTILITIES US ENVOY DONALD BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT TO THE MEDIA, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED THAT THE REBELS SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IJN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT OMER AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. FOLLOWING THE JOINT MEETING, BOOTH MET WITH REBEL GROUPS FROM DARFUR REGION AND DISCUSSED THEIR DEMAND FOR RENEGOTIATING THE DOHA DOCUMENT FOR PEACE IN DARFUR. BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED TO THE REBEL GROUPS THAT THEY SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. SUDAN TRIBUNE LEARNT THAT BOOTH ALSO HELD A SEPARATE MEETIN WITH THE SPLM-N TO DISCUSS NEGOTIATIONS WITH KHARTOUM ON A DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES DOCUMENT, INCLUDING A CEASEFIRE, AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO CIVILIANS IN THE SPLM-N CONTROLLED AREAS.  AT THE MOMENT WE ARE STILL HEAVILY WEIGHTED TO COMMODITIES. ON ITS PART, SUDAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT - ABDEL WAHID AL-NUR ISSUED A STATEMENT REITQERATING ITS DEMAND FOR PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS, DIFSARMING THE JANJAWEED AND THE REMOVAL OF NEW-COMERS FROM THE LANDS AND HAWAKEER. THE STATEMENT CLEARLY PROVIDED THAT THE GROUP WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE WITH KHARTOUM UNTIL THOSE "CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES" WERE MET.
398	THOUSANDS OF ACRES, HUNDREDS OF HORSES. YESTERDAY, I FLEW MY HELICOPTER BACK TO THE WENATCHEE, WA AREA FROM SOME MAINTENANCE DONE IN HILLSBORO, OR. IN A PERFECT WORLD, THE WEATHER WOULD BE CLEAR AND THE AIR CALM AND I COULD FLY A DIRECT ROUTE THAT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 90-100 MINUTES. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW, THE WORLD IS NOT PERFECT AND, ONCE AGAIN, I HAD TO TAKE A LONGER ROUTE, THIS TIME TO SKIRT AROUND THE EDGE OF SOME VERY NASTY RAIN SHOWERS THAT STRETCHED WEST/EAST FROM MT. SAINT HELENS TO ROUTE 97 AND NORTH/SOUTH FROM MT. RAINIER TO THE COLUMBIA RIVER. A DIRECT ROUTE, WHICH IVE DONE TWICE BACK IN 2012 (SEE VIDEO), TAKES ME BETWEEN MT. SAINT HELENS AND MOUNT ADAMS. YESTERDAYS ROUTE HAD ME FOLLOWING THE COLUMBIA RIVER FROM VISTA HOUSE EAST OF TROUTDALE TO JUST PAST HOOD RIVER. FROM THERE, I HEADED NORTHEAST, RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE RAIN, KEEPING A SHARP EYE OUT FOR LIGHTNING THAT WOULD INDICATE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. ALTHOUGH I DIDNT SEE ANY FLASHES, RADAR IN FOREFLIGHT AND MY RADARUS APP CLEARLY SHOWED SOME VERY DENSE CELLS OFF MY LEFT SHOULDER ALL THE WAY AND THE RAIN WAS INTENSE. THE AIR I FLEW IN WAS REMARKABLY CALM, THOUGH, AND I ONLY FLEW THROUGH RAIN AS I FOLLOWED THE ROUTE OF ROUTE 97 NORTHEAST OF GOLDENDALE, WHERE IT GOES THROUGH A PASS. FROM THERE, I CUT AWAY FROM THE ROAD, AIMING FOR SUNNYSIDE. I MODIFIED MY ROUTE TO GO AROUND THE SOUTH-EAST CORNER OF THE RESTRICTED AREA NORTHEAST OF YAKIMA AND FLY HOME ALONG THE COLUMBIA RIVER FROM MATTAWA. HERES A ROUGH SKETCH OF MY ROUTE, DRAWN IN SKYVECTOR. THE RED BOX IS A TFR FOR FIREFIGHTING; ODDLY, THE RAINSTORMS WERE CENTERED RIGHT OVER THAT BOX. IT WAS OVER THE YAKAMA NATION (NOT A TYPO), BETWEEN ROUTE 97 AND ROUTE 12 THAT I SAW THE WILD HORSES. I KNEW THEY WERE OUT THERE, OF COURSE. YOU CAN OFTEN SEE HERDS FROM ROUTE 97 BETWEEN TOPPENISH AND GOLDENDALE. BUT EAST OF THE ROAD IS WHERE MOST OF THE HORSES SEEM TO LIVE. THE LAND FORMS THERE REMIND ME OF THE HOPI MESAS IN ARIZONA, LONG, FLAT, FINGER-LIKE MESAS STRETCHING TO THE SOUTHWEST, WHERE THE LAND DROPS OFF IN A STEEP SLOPE. THE HORSE HERDS ARE DOTTED MOSTLY ALONG THE MESA TOPS, ALTHOUGH I DID SEE A FEW HERDS IN BETWEEN. I FLEW OVER THEM, PERHAPS 300 FEET UP, AND WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO CLEARLY SEE THE COLORING OF THE HORSES I FEW NEAR. MOST HERDS SEEM TO INCLUDE A YOUNGSTER OR TWO WHO TOOK OFF, RUNNING BACK TO MAMA, WHEN HE/SHE HEARD ME COMING. WHEN I SAY THERE WERE HERDS OF WILD HORSES, IM NOT TALKING ABOUT TWO OR THREE HERDS. THERE WERE AT LEAST THAT MANY HERDS ON EACH OF THE MESAS I FLEW OVER. EACH HERD HAD 5 TO 20 HORSES IN IT AND I MUST HAVE SEEN AT LEAST 20 HERDS. THATS HUNDREDS OF HORSES. I HAD MY GOPRO NOSECAM GOING WHILE I FLEW. HERES ONE OF THE SHOTS CAPTURED ALONG THE WAY. THE VIDEO CLIPS SHOW HOW SOME HERDS IGNORED ME WHILE OTHERS TOOK OFF RUNNING AT THE SOUND OF MY APPROACH. AND NO, UNLIKE OTHER PILOTS A FAMOUS PHOENIX AREA NEWS PILOT COMES TO MIND I DONT CHASE THE HORSES WITH MY HELICOPTER. NOW SOME FOLKS WHO SEE THE HORSES ALONG THE ROAD SEEM TO THINK THAT THEYRE NOT WILD. THEY CONFUSE A NEW FENCE LIKELY ERECTED TO KEEP OPEN RANGE CATTLE OFF THE ROADWAY WITH A FENCE TO KEEP THE HORSES ON SOMEONES PROPERTY. BUT HAVING FLOWN OVER THE AREA, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THESE HORSES ARE NOT FENCED IN. I FLEW FOR MILES, COVERING THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF LAND, AND DIDNT SEE ANY HOMES OR RANCH BUILDINGS, NO FEEDING STATIONS, FEW TWO-TRACK ROADS, AND NO ADDITIONAL FENCING. THESE HORSES DONT BELONG TO ANY ONE PERSON. THEYRE WILD. LIKE THE WILD HORSES ON THE NAVAJO RESERVATION IN NORTHERN ARIZONA. OR THOSE ALONG THE VERDE AND SALT RIVERS NOT FAR FROM PHOENIX. OR THE ONES ALONG THE GILA RIVER, WEST OF CHANDLER, AZ. AND IN WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHER PLACES? SEEING THINGS LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THE PERKS OF BEING A HELICOPTER PILOT ABLE TO FLY IN SOME OF THIS COUNTRYS REMOTE AREAS. ID LOVE TO DO TOURS TO SHOW OFF THE WILD HORSE OF THE YAKAMA NATION. UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE SO MUCH OF THE INCREDIBLE SCENERY I GET TO FLY OVER ON LONG CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHTS, ITS JUST TOO FAR AWAY TO BE AFFORDABLE TO THE TYPICAL WENATCHEE SIGHTSEER.
399	SORROW AND SURVIVAL IN WILDFIRE-RAVAGED CALIFORNIA MIDDLETOWN (UNITED STATES) (AFP) - AN AIR TANKER CUT ACROSS THE SKY AS PAULA CHAVES AND EVE MELAND LOADED A PICKUP TRUCK WITH SUPPLIES TO SURVIVE WICKED WILDFIRES YET TO BE VANQUISHED. CHAVES AND HER NEIGHBOR STOCKED UP AT HARDESTER'S MARKET ON THE MAIN STRIP OF THE FIRE-RAVAGED COMMUNITY OF MIDDLETOWN. THE MARKET STAYED OPEN DURING A FIRESTORM THAT WHIPPED THROUGH THE AREA, TURNING HOMES, RANCHES AND MORE TO ASHES. IT WAS THE FOURTH TIME IN A MONTH THAT CHAVES HAD BEEN EVACUATED FROM HER HOME ON THE BORDER OF MIDDLETOWN AND LOWER LAKE BECAUSE OF WILDFIRES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SHE ESCAPED LAST WEEKEND WITH HALF OF HER HORSES, THEN BRAVED THE FIRE DANGER TO GO BACK FOR MORE HORSES, A PIG AND CHICKENS. ON TUESDAY, SHE WAS AMONG THOSE WHO MANAGED TO GET BACK INTO THE AREA. SHE FOUND HER HOME STILL STANDING. HER PACKED PICKUP BED HELD FUEL FOR GENERATORS TO POWER WELL PUMPS TO GET WATER FOR LIVESTOCK AND THEMSELVES. THERE WAS ALSO DISINFECTANT, ICE, GROCERIES, DOG FOOD, CAT FOOD, ICE AND BEER. "IT IS EVERYDAY SURVIVAL RIGHT NOW, AND BEING VERY WATCHFUL AND CAUTIOUS OF WHAT COULD POSSIBLY SNEAK UP ON US," CHAVES TOLD AFP. "THERE IS NO SLEEPING." SHE AND HER NEIGHBORS HAVE A PACT THAT IF ANYONE SPOTS FLAMES HEADING TOWARD THEIR PROPERTY, THEY LAY ON THE HORNS OF THEIR TRUCKS OR CARS AS THEY RACE TO ESCAPE IN ORDER TO WARN OTHERS. "IT ISN'T THE BEST SYSTEM, BUT IT IS WHAT WE'VE GOT," CHAVES SAID. "THERE IS NO CELL PHONE SERVICE OUT THERE." - LITTLE MORE THAN ASH - AS GRIM AS THE SITUATION WAS FOR CHAVES, BROTHERS ANDY AND MARK SNELL WERE HIT WITH DESPAIR ELSEWHERE IN THIS SMALL TOWN. THE BROTHERS MADE THEIR WAY PAST ROADBLOCKS TO FIND RUBBLE AND ASHES WHERE A FAMILY HOME ONCE STOOD. IT WAS THERE THAT THEY HAD SPENT MUCH OF THEIR LIVES, HAD CHILDREN AND CELEBRATED HOLIDAYS. "EVERY YEAR, WE WOULD HAVE CHRISTMAS HERE," MARK SNELL SAID, HIS EYES WATERING WITH TEARS AS HE SCANNED THE DEBRIS. "IT WAS THE FAMILY MEETING PLACE, NOW WE'VE GOT NOTHING." ANDY SNELL FOUND A KNEE-HIGH CERAMIC SANTA CLAUS IN THE ASHES AND SET IT UPRIGHT IN THE ASHED FACING THE STREET, IN A SMALL VENGEANCE AGAINST THE FLAMES AND THE FAILURE OF EFFORTS TO SAVE HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW'S HOME. - FLAMES SLOW BUT DANGEROUS - BLACKENED WRECKAGE, SOME OF IT STILL SMOLDERING, LINED ROADS LEADING AWAY FROM MIDDLETOWN'S MAIN STREET. CHAINSAWS ROARED AND SAWDUST MIXED WITH SMOKE AS EMERGENCY CREWS TOOK DOWN CHARRED TREES THEY FEARED COULD FALL. OVERHEAD, HELICOPTERS AND AIR TANKERS FERRIED WATER AND FLAME-SMOTHERING GELS TO DUMP ON FLAMES THAT SLOWLY EXPANDED THE PERIMETER OF THE WILDFIRE. THE FLAMES HAD STOPPED RUNNING, BUT WERE NOT TO BE TRUSTED SINCE WIND COULD SEND THEM SPRINTING. OFFICIALS DECLARED THE BLAZE 15 PERCENT CONTAINED BY MID-DAY. CALFIRE SPOKESMAN FERNANDO HERRERA EXPECTED IT TO BE WEEKS BEFORE THE FIRE WAS UNDER CONTROL, WITH MORE WEEKS OF "MOPPING UP" IN STORE TO STOMP OUT EMBERS AND COMPLETELY RESTORE UTILITIES AND SERVICES FOR RESIDENTS. THE AREA STILL IS NOT OFFICIALLY OPEN FOR EVACUEES TO RETURN. SHIFTING WINDS COULD TURN THE WILDFIRE INTO A DEADLY BEAST AND DRIVE IT BACK TOWARD HOMES THAT WERE SPARED THE FIRST TIME. "SOME PEOPLE SNEAK IN; SOME STAYED, AND SOME KNOW BACK WAYS IN; YOU CAN'T CONTROL THAT," HERRERA SAID. "THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CAMPING OUT AND LIVING LIKE THAT, BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO NEED THAT AIR CONDITIONER, NEED THAT POWER, NEED THAT WATER AND IT IS BETTER FOR THEM TO STAY OUT." THOSE WHOSE HOMES ARE DESTROYED HAVE NOTHING TO COME BACK FOR, HE ADDED SADLY, HOPING THEY WOULD NOT RISK RETURNING. UTILITY CREWS HAD A MILITARY-STYLE CAMP SET UP AT A SCHOOL CAMPUS, COMPLETE WITH TENTS, TRAILERS, A COMMAND POST AND A MESS HALL. THERE WERE MORE THAN 400 WORKERS AND FLEETS OF TRUCKS. SOME 7,200 CUSTOMERS REMAINED WITHOUT POWER, ACCORDING TO PACIFIC GAS & ELECTRIC COMPANY SPOKESMAN DENNY BOYLES. FLAMES STILL ATE AT UTILITY POLES AND POWER LINES, AND ONLY A FIFTH OF THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN ASSESSED BECAUSE MOST OF THE AREA WAS CONSIDERED TOO DANGEROUS FOR REPAIR CREWS. "IT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGING RESTORATION PROJECT," BOYLES SAID, WARILY EYING THICK PLUMES OF SMOKE BILLOWING FROM NEARBY HILLS. - GRATEFUL EVEN FOR GRAPES - HARDESTER'S MARKET USED GENERATORS FOR ELECTRICITY AND REMAINED OPEN AS THE WILDFIRE FLANKED THE BUSINESS STRIP, DEVOURING HOMES, CARS AND MORE. THE MARKET CARRIES NEARLY EVERYTHING FROM PAINT, POWER TOOLS AND LUMBER TO GROCERIES, WINE AND LOCAL CHEESES. "EVERYONE IN HERE COULD TELL YOU A HORROR STORY YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE," SAID MARKET MANAGER ASHLEY MAYHEW, WHO RAN THE SHOP THROUGH IT ALL. "I KNOW A WOMAN WHOSE HOUSE WAS GONE BUT SHE WAS ELATED BECAUSE SHE FOUND A CAT. "ONE LADY WAS HAPPY BECAUSE SHE SAVED SOME GRAPES. THEY DON'T HAVE SHOES, CLOTHES... ANYTHING BUT THEY ARE HAPPY JUST TO FIND A CAT OR SOME GRAPES." THOSE WHO RETURNED, WHETHER TO FIND HOMES INTACT OR DESTROYED, SET OUT IN SEARCH OF PETS OR LIVESTOCK THAT MAY HAVE MANAGED TO STAY ALIVE. "THERE WERE HORSES ALL OVER SPRUCEVILLE ROAD; COWS OUT, DOGS RUNNING FREE," CHAVES SAID OF THE SCENE AS SHE FLED THE AREA ON SATURDAY. "IT WAS SO SAD THINKING THESE ANIMALS HAVE NO FOOD AND WATER. IT IS LIKE A MAZE OUT THERE WITH ALL THE BARBED WIRE AND FIRE TRUCKS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE." WITH THE ONSET OF EVENING, POLICE CLOSED OFF MIDDLETOWN AND VIGILANTLY CRUISED ROADS BECAUSE OF TROUBLE WITH LOOTERS.
400	FROM A NOTORIOUS CON MAN TO CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES, THIS GRAND HOME -- NAY, THIS GRAND COMPOUND -- IN THE HEART OF THE LOS FELIZ NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES HAS HOUSED QUITE A CAST OF CHARACTERS OVER THE YEARS. WITH 14 BEDROOMS AND EIGHT BATHROOMS, IT'S RICH WITH HISTORY AND BRIMMING WITH POSSIBILITIES. BUILT IN 1929 BY ARCHITECT HARLEY S. BRADLEY FOR A MAN NAMED RUDOLPH ROSENBERG , IT WAS SOLD THE SAME YEAR TO MUSIC STORE MAGNATE BEN PLATT . OVER THE YEARS, PLATT HIRED ARCHITECTS PAUL R. WILLIAMS AND ALBERT E. HANSEN , TO EXPAND IT, ADDING A POOL, TENNIS COURTS, AND ANOTHER STORY TO BRING IT TO ITS CURRENT 10,000-SQUARE-FOOT MEASUREMENT. THE NEXT OWNER WAS A NOTORIOUS CON MAN NAMED C.C. JULIAN , WHOM LISTING AGENT DAVID SOLOMON DESCRIBES AS THE BERNIE MADOFF OF HIS DAY. AFTER HIS COMPANY, THE JULIAN PETROLEUM CORP., WAS FOUND TO HAVE SWINDLED MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE OUT OF $150 MILLION, JULIAN COMMITTED SUICIDE (NOT IN THIS HOME) IN 1934. IN THE LATE 1950S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OWNER TOOK OVER: THE SAINT COLUMBAN'S FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY, A GROUP OF CATHOLIC MISSIONARY PRIESTS WHO STILL LIVE THERE TODAY. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES MADE TO THE HOME OVER THE YEARS (SPACES WERE DIVIDED TO CREATE ADDITIONAL ROOMS TO HOUSE PRIESTS), SOLOMON SAYS THE HOME RETAINS MANY OF ITS ORIGINAL FEATURES, INCLUDING CARVED FIREPLACES AND DETAILED WOODWORK. THE MOST NOTEWORTHY HISTORIC FEATURE IS A CAVE THAT LEADS TO A HIDDEN WINE CELLAR TO A FULL SPEAK-EASY USED DURING PROHIBITION. THERE ARE ALSO QUARTERS FOR LIVE-IN STAFF. SOLOMON SAYS IT WILL TAKE THE RIGHT BUYER TO BRING THE HOME TO PRESENT-DAY STANDARDS, BUT THE RETURN COULD BE HUGE. CURRENTLY LISTED FOR $5,499,000, THE PROPERTY COULD BE VALUED AT OVER $12 MILLION POSTRENOVATION BASED ON ITS SIZE, HISTORY, AND LOCATION. "WHEN IT'S REDONE, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPERTIES IN LOS ANGELES," HE SAYS. ALTHOUGH THE HOME IS SET BACK FROM THE ROAD, IT FEATURES AMAZING CITY VIEWS AND IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HOLLYWOOD'S GREEK THEATRE AND GRIFFITH PARK. AS FOR THE NEIGHBORS, THINK HOLLYWOOD STARS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOME BEHIND THIS PROPERTY USED TO BE ROBERT PATTINSON 'S LOVE NEST WITH THEN-GIRLFRIEND KRISTEN STEWART . THE "TWILIGHT" STAR SOLD THE HOME IN 2014, AND NOW JIM PARSONS OF "THE BIG BANG THEORY" LIVES THERE. SO WHO'LL BE NEXT TO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THIS HISTORIC HOME? SOLOMON SAYS WHILE IT COULD BE ANYONE FROM A SINGLE FAMILY TO A PRODUCTION COMPANY, THE LUCKY OWNER WILL DEFINITELY POSSESS ONE QUALITY. "THE RIGHT BUYER WILL BE SOMEONE WHO HAS AN APPRECIATION FOR THE TYPE OF HOME THEY JUST DON'T BUILD ANYMORE," HE SAID. "THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS."
401	IT'S A NIGHTMARE THAT UNFOLDS UNPREDICTABLY, IN A SPLIT SECOND. A CAR EMERGES FROM THE BLACKNESS HEADING THE WRONG WAY ALONG AN UNLIT DIVIDED HIGHWAY. IT SHOULDN'T BE THERE. BEHIND THE WHEEL IS A DRIVER LIKE JOHN R. FRETTS OF MORRIS, WHOSE HYUNDAI ELANTRA BARRELED NORTH IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANE OF ROUTE 8 ON THE NIGHT OF AUG. 22 UNTIL HE STRUCK 29-YEAR-OLD DAVID DZIADIK HEAD ON NEAR EXIT 37, KILLING HIM INSTANTLY, POLICE SAID. THIS WAS THE LATEST WRONG-WAY CRASH ON ROUTE 8, WHICH HAS SEEN AT LEAST THREE FATAL ACCIDENTS IN 10 YEARS BECAUSE OF WRONG-WAY DRIVERS, BUT SIMILAR ACCIDENTS FOR THE SAME REASON HAVE BEEN REPORTED STATEWIDE FOR YEARS. OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO, THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PLANS TO REPLACE THE SIX, STAGGERED REFLECTIVE SIGNS ALONG EXIT RAMPS WITH BIGGER, MORE REFLECTIVE SIGNS POSITIONED JUST ABOVE SNOWBANK LEVEL. ALL OF THE NEW "DO NOT ENTER," ''WRONG WAY" AND "ONE WAY" SIGNS ARE LARGER AND MORE REFLECTIVE, AND HAVE REFLECTIVE POSTS. "THEY WILL BE AS IN YOUR FACE AS THEY CAN BE," SAID , DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION SPOKESMAN. THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY IS WORKING WITH THE STATE POLICE TO IDENTIFY LOCATIONS WITH "ABNORMALLY HIGH" INCIDENCE OF WRONG WAY DRIVERS, BUT ALL OF THE RAMPS WILL HAVE NEW SIGNS THROUGH $5.5 MILLION IN FEDERAL HIGHWAY SAFETY IMPROVEMENT FUNDING. EIGHT OF THE NEWER SIGNS WILL REPLACE SIX SMALLER ONES. THE GOAL, NURSICK SAID, IS SPECIFICALLY TO KEEP DRIVERS FROM ENTERING AN EXIT RAMP. "WE ARE NOT AN ENFORCEMENT AGENCY," NURSICK SAID. "BUT IT MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SAVING LIVES. IT'S STILL A FUNDAMENTAL DRIVER ERROR ISSUE. THAT MESSAGE STILL NEEDS TO BE REINFORCED." THE SIGNS WILL BE A HIGH-PROFILE ATTEMPT TO GAIN ATTENTION. THEY DON'T ADDRESS THE CAUSE OF WHAT POLICE SAY IS BEHIND NEARLY ALL OF THE WRONG-WAY CASES REPORTED STATEWIDE: DRUNK DRIVERS. A NATIONAL TRAFFIC SAFETY BOARD REVIEW IN 2011 FOUND THAT MOST WRONG-WAY DRIVER CRASHES NATIONWIDE, INCLUDING A CHAIN-REACTION, DEADLY CRASH THAT YEAR IN COLORADO, INVOLVED ALCOHOL OR DRUG USE. FACING A WRONG WAY DRIVER IS A PARTICULARLY TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE. ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE 28, 2008, MERIDEN POLICE OFFICER JEREMIAH SCULLY, THEN A NAUGATUCK POLICE CAPTAIN, WAS HEADING HOME FROM A PRIVATE DUTY JOB IN A CRUISER WHEN HE SWERVED TO AVOID A DARK CAR WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS THAT CAME AT HIM AS HE HEADED NORTH ON ROUTE 8. ARTHUR ANTUNES DIDN'T SEE THE SAME CAR AS IT REACHED HIM NEAR EXITS 28 AND 29, BUT HE SAW HIS FRIEND'S CAR SWERVE IN FRONT OF HIM AS THEY BOTH DROVE HOME FROM A FISHING TRIP TO MILFORD. HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HIS FRIEND'S CAR SWERVED. THEN, IN A FLASH, HE UNDERSTOOD. HE SWERVED. THE ONCOMING DRIVER SWERVED. THEY CRASHED. "IT WAS LIKE A NIGHTMARE," HE SAID AT THE TIME. "THE CAR WAS COMING SO FAST." THE FATHER OF TWO SUFFERED SEVERE INTERNAL AND LEG INJURIES AND SCREAMED IN PAIN AS FIREFIGHTERS WORKED TO EXTRICATE HIM FROM HIS CAR THAT WAS PINNED AGAINST A BRIDGE ABUTMENT, SCULLY RECALLED. THE DRIVER OF THE OTHER CAR, SARAH M. FARKAS OF NAUGATUCK, ALSO SUFFERED INJURIES AND HAD TO BE EXTRICATED. SHE WAS CHARGED WITH DRUNKEN DRIVING AND SENTENCED THE FOLLOWING YEAR TO 18 MONTHS OF PROBATION AND A $500 FINE. "I SWUNG TO THE RIGHT SO HARD THAT IT RIPPED THE CARPET UNDER THE PEDAL," SAID SCULLY, WHO CALLED IN WHAT HE HAD SEEN TO DISPATCHERS AND THEN TURNED AROUND. "I KNEW I WAS GOING TO COME UPON A CRASH." IT WAS ONE OF TWO WRONG-WAY DRIVING INCIDENTS SCULLY WAS INVOLVED IN DURING HIS 27 YEARS AS A POLICE OFFICER IN THOMASTON, NAUGATUCK AND MERIDEN. IT STILL HAUNTS HIM. "I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY TIME I DRIVE ON ROUTE 8 AT NIGHT," HE SAID. POLICE DEPARTMENTS ALONG THE ROUTE 8 CORRIDOR ARE ON THE ALERT FOR WRONG WAY DRIVERS, PARTICULARLY ON WEEKEND OVERNIGHTS WHEN THERE IS A GREATER STATISTICAL LIKELIHOOD THAT DRUNKS WHO OFTEN ARE THE CAUSE OF SUCH CRASHES ARE ON THE ROAD, SAID STATE POLICE SGT. PAOLO D'ALESSANDRO, OF TROOP L IN LITCHFIELD. THE NUMBER OF WRONG WAY DRIVERS IS UNKNOWN, BUT LAST YEAR JUST ONE WAS STOPPED ON ROUTE 8, WHICH RUNS FROM THE LOWER NAUGATUCK VALLEY TO ITS END IN WINSTED, STATE POLICE SAID. SO FAR THIS YEAR, FOUR CASES ARE ON FILE WITH THE STATE POLICE. STATEWIDE, 216 WERE CHARGED WITH WRONG WAY DRIVING LAST YEAR, RECORDS SHOW. UNLIKE ERRATIC OPERATION ALONG A SECONDARY ROAD, WRONG WAY DRIVERS ARE MOVING FAST, NOT ALWAYS SWERVING AND TEND TO BE EXTREMELY INTOXICATED. THE ODDITY CAN SEEM CONFUSING AT FIRST, SLOWING REACTION TIME. "THESE ARE TRUE EMERGENCIES," D'ALESSANDRO SAID. WHEN CALLS BEGAN COMING IN SATURDAY FROM THE HIGHWAY, TROOPERS WERE DISPATCHED TO SHUT THE ROAD DOWN IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROTOCOL. ALWAYS TRAVELING IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION, STATE POLICE SPOKESMAN KELLY GRANT SAID, THE GOAL IS TO PULL VEHICLES OFF TO THE SHOULDER AHEAD OF THE WRONG WAY DRIVER. BUT AS OFTEN HAPPENS, FRETTS CRASHED BEFORE THEY GOT THERE. "SOMETIMES THEY CORRECT THEMSELVES AND GET OFF THE HIGHWAY," D'ALESSANDRO SAID. "IT CAN BE LIKE CHASING A GHOST IN THE DARK." THE BEST DEFENSIVE TACTIC TO AVOID A CRASH IS TO REMAIN IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE, SAID GRANT AND D'ALESSANDRO. "THEY MIGHT BE THINKING THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES, OR THAT THEY ARE ON A TWO-LANE ROAD AS CARS SWERVE TO THE LEFT," D'ALESSANDRO SAID. ALCOHOL ISN'T ALWAYS THE REASON. D'ALESSANDRO SAID HE ONCE STOPPED AN ELDERLY MAN WITH DEMENTIA HEADING THE WRONG WAY IN WATERBURY. AN ELDERLY WOMAN, TOLD BY STATE POLICE AFTER SHE WAS STOPPED NEAR TORRINGTON SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT SHE WAS HEADED THE WRONG WAY, ASKED THE TROOPER HOW HE KNOW WHERE SHE WAS GOING. IT'S STILL NOT KNOWN WHAT CAUSED FRETTS TO ENTER AN EXIT RAMP IN WATERBURY, BUT POLICE SAY THEY HAVE EVIDENCE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. DETAILS REMAIN SKETCHY AS THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES AND POLICE KEEP THEIR DEVELOPING CASE UNDER WRAPS. "DIABETES CAN MIMIC ALCOHOL AND ALSO LEAD TO CONFUSION," SCULLY SAID. "WEATHER OBSCURING TRAFFIC SIGNS, LACK OF SLEEP, DEMENTIA AND MEDICATION CAN ALSO PLAY A PART." BUT ALCOHOL IS THE MAJOR FACTOR. SOMETIMES WRONG-WAY DRUNKS CAUSE MAYHEM, BUT DON'T KILL PEOPLE. NO ONE DIED IN FEBRUARY 2008 WHEN A DRUNKEN DRIVER FROM WATERTOWN CAUSED SIX CRASHES AND WRECKED EIGHT CARS DRIVING NORTH IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANE ON ROUTE 8 AFTER ENTERING AT EXIT 24. MICHAEL D. KANTOR SMASHED HIS CHEVY CORSICA INTO TWO SUBARUS, A TOYOTA AND A HONDA, AND CAUSED THREE OTHER CARS TO CRASH. OFTEN, HOWEVER, PEOPLE SUFFER SERIOUS INJURY, OR DIE. ON APRIL 28, 2012, 24-YEAR-OLD WILLIAM BAER JR. OF BEACON FALLS WAS KILLED ALONG ROUTE 8 WHEN HIS HONDA ACCORD WAS STRUCK NEAR EXIT 27 BY CHEVY VAN DRIVEN BY WRONG WAY DRIVER EDMUNDO MENDIETA, A 34-YEAR-OLD NEW HAVEN MAN. MENDIETA, WHO TOLD POLICE HE COULDN'T REMEMBER THE DRIVE AND HAD DRUNK SIX BEERS ON AN EMPTY STOMACH, WAS SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS IN PRISON. LIKE MANY DRUNKEN WRONG WAY DRIVERS, HIS BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL WAS WELL OVER THE LEGAL LIMIT AT 0.221 PERCENT. FRONT SEAT PASSENGER SARA CHMIELEWSKI, A STRATFORD RESIDENT, WAS SEVERELY INJURED AND PERMANENTLY IMPAIRED. AT MENDIETA'S SENTENCING HEARING, JUDGE ROLAND FASANO TOLD HIM THE INJUSTICE WAS THAT HE SURVIVED THE DEADLY MAYHEM HE CREATED.
402	IF THERES ONE THING YOU WILL FIND IN THE VALLEY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AN EXTREME TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE, IS THE DIVERSE FOOD SCENE. THIS WEEKS RECOGNIZED RESTAURANT FOR BRINGING GASTRONOMIC FLARE TO THE WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY IS A LITTLE HIDDEN SPOT ON WINNETKA AVENUE JUST NORTH OF ROSCOE BOULEVARD CALLED WHITE RABBIT FUSION CAFE. THIS FILIPINO-FUSION RESTAURANT OWNED BY THREE BEST FRIENDS. JAMES DU AND HIS FORMER ROOMMATES, MICHAEL DIMAGUILA AND MELVIN CHUA, OPENED WHITE RABBIT TRUCK IN JULY 2010. WE NOTICED A NICHE THAT NEEDED TO BE FILLED IN THE FOOD TRUCK MARKET AT THE TIME. WE HAD KOREAN MEXICAN FUSION, JAPANESE FUSION AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT KIND OF THINGS. WE ALWAYS KNEW FILIPINO FOOD WAS GOOD, IT WOULD COMPETE, ONLY PROBLEM WAS NO ONE WAS COMPETING. THE THREE WERE SUCCESSFUL AT SUCH A FAST RATE THAT FIVE MONTHS LATER THE TRIO OPENED THE CAF IN WINNETKA. THAT WAS A NICHE WE TRIED TO FILL, DU SAYS. THERES A BUNCH OF STEREOTYPES THAT FILIPINO FOOD IS UNHEALTHY AND GREASY. WE ARE JUST TRYING TO CHANGE THAT, AND OBVIOUSLY WE WANT OUR CULTURE TO BE MAINSTREAM. WE WANT TO SEE FILIPINO SHOPS EVERYWHERE, BUT IT STARTS WITH THE FIRST STEP. OTHER THAN THE LOW PRICES, WHAT MAKES THE FOOD AT WHITE RABBIT SO SPECIAL ARE THE TRADITIONAL FILIPINO DISHES MERGED INTO MODERN L.A. STREET FOOD, SPECIFICALLY MEXICAN, FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN PALATE. EVERYONES FAMILIAR WITH TACOS AND BURRITOS, DU STATES. IT WAS THE BEST WAY FOR US TO INTRODUCE FILIPINO FOOD TO THE MASSES. ONE OF THEIR MORE POPULAR DISHES THAT HAS PUT WHITE RABBIT ON THE MAP IS THE SISIG BURRITO. ITS A FILLING BUT NOT OVERWHELMING WELL-SEASONED, CRISPY PORK COOKED WITH ONION AND JALAPENO, ROLLED UP WITH RICE AND A FRIED EGG IN A TORTILLA. THE SISIG BURRITO AND LYCHEE ICED TEA WITH ALOE TOPPING. ROZA ASGHARZADEH/ THE SUNDIAL THE ZESTY FLAVORING IS A NICE CONTRAST TO THE PORK AND EGG THAT GIVES IT A FRESH, LIGHT TASTE. TRADITIONALLY THE SISIG MEAT IS COOKED WITH PIGS HEAD, HOWEVER KNOWING CHEEKS AND CARTILAGE WOULDNT SOUND APPETIZING TO A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HERE, THE BOYS DECIDED TO USE PORK BELLY INSTEAD. TWO TABLES AWAY FROM ME SIT A HAPPY AMERICAN-FILIPINO COMPANY ENJOYING A VARIETY OF DISHES FROM THE MENU. KAREN MIRAFLOR RECOMMENDS THE TINOLA FRIED CHICKEN. IT USED TO BE A CHICKEN STEW IN THE PHILIPPINES, AND [DU] TOOK IT AND FRIED IT. STILL TASTES LIKE THE STEW FROM OUR CHILDHOOD, BUT ITS EVEN BETTER NOW CAUSE ITS FRIED! SHE CONTINUES. WITH THE FOOD HERE, ITS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHEN YOU TAKE SOMETHING CLASSIC AND PUT A SPIN ON IT AND MAKE IT EVEN BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. VICTOR MIRAFLOR, A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND FRIEND OF DUS, SAYS THE SECRET BEHIND THE GOOD FOOD AT THE WHITE RABBIT IS DUS LOVE FOR FOOD AT THE END OF THE DAY. YOU GOTTA LOVE WHAT YOURE DOING WHEN YOURE IN THE SIXTH YEAR OF DOING IT, MIRAFLOR SAYS SMILING. WHETHER YOU ARE HUNGRY AND WANT QUALITY STREET FOOD OR NEED TO QUENCH A THIRST WITH SOME ICED DRINKS STOP BY WHITE RABBIT FUSION CAFE.
403	HEY ALL! MY NAME IS PLUTO. I AM A PUPPY MILL RESCUE. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ME FROM MY DAILY CORGI DEBUT BACK IN MAY. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK! THE GOOD NEWS? I AM ADJUSTING TO LIFE ON THE OUTSIDE. AND THERE IS ICE CREAM HERE. ICE CREAM, PEOPLE. CAN YOU DIG IT? MY LIFE HAS BEEN BUSY AND INTENSE THESE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, AS I SET NEW BOUNDARIES AND GROW MORE RELAXED WITH MY NEW FAMILY AND HUMANS IN GENERAL. THEY SAY I'M "VERY VOCAL". SURE, I BARK AT STRANGERS. WHO DOESN'T? I BARK AT MY HUMANS, BUT THEY PLAY THE BARKING GAME TOO. LITTLE BARKS BACK AND FORTH. I PULL OUT MY CUTE HOWL, BUT LOSE MY VOICE HALF WAY THROUGH EVERY TIME, FINISHING WITH A SILENT HOWLING POSE. A GUY HAS TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD AND SEEN, AFTER ALL. I'M NOT UP FOR A LOT OF PLAY, EXCEPT FOR FIRST OUTSIDE TRIPS IN THE MORNING AND AT NIGHT. WE DO LAPS TOGETHER, BUT AT SOME POINT I'M NOT SURE WHETHER WE'RE PLAYING OR CHASING, AND I DON'T LIKE BEING CHASED. IT GETS CONFUSING! THIS IS ME BEING CONFUSED. ALTHOUGH I PREFER THE CLOSE CONFINES OF MY KENNEL, WHERE I CAN SHRED TISSUES AND HOARD MY COLLECTED OBJECTS D'ART INTO A PILE, I ENJOY HANGING WITH THE PACK AFTER WALKS, EATING, OR PLAYING OUTSIDE. HERE AND THERE DURING THE DAY, THE UPRIGHTS PICK ME UP AND HOLD ME. I RELAX PRETTY FAST AND HAVE EVEN FALLEN ASLEEP ON A FEW LAPS. NAP LAPS ROCK. I AM BRAVEST WHEN OUT AND ABOUT. "IRRESISTIBLE" THEY EXCLAIM. I'M SHY, BUT I'LL SNIFF HANDS AND EVEN LET THE NICE ONES PET ME. AS I SAY, IRRESISTIBLE. NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT THAT. IT'S GREAT FUN STOPPING TO SMELL EVERY ROSE AND GREET EVERY DOG. I MANAGE CROWDED SIDEWALKS VERY WELL, STAYING RIGHT AT MY HEEL IN CROWDS. I HAVE GRACED SEVERAL OUTDOOR PATIOS AND DOG FRIENDLY STORES, WHERE A GOOD TIME WAS HAD BY ALL. GETTING MY CHILLAX ON AT HIGHLAND GRILL. MY FOLKS RECENTLY TOOK ME TO A LARGE FAMILY BIRTHDAY PARTY (19 PEOPLE, 5 DOGS, 2 CATS), WHERE I MET SEVERAL OF NIECES AND NEPHEWS AND 3 OTHER DOGS MORE MY SIZE. DESPITE THE RAUCOUS ATMOSPHERE (FOOTBALL, BOARD GAMES, LOUD CONVERSATIONS, FOOD) I DID GREAT, DARTING ABOUT THE ROOM BY MYSELF AND WITH THE OTHER DOGS. I LAID WITH AUNT TESSA AND COUSIN EMILIA (MINI HUMAN AT SIX YEARS OLD) FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE AGES. I'M PRETTY I MIGHT ALSO HAVE DOZED OFF IN THE LAP OF A STRANGER! LET IT BE NOTED FOR THE RECORD: I LOSE ALL ANXIETY IN THE PRESENCE OF HARD SALAMI, VENISON JERKY, AND GOLDFISH CRACKERS. YES, SALAMI. IS THERE SALAMI FLAVORED ICE CREAM YET? HUMANS, GET CRACKIN'! IT'S HIGH TIME THAT DELI MEATS AND ICE CREAM GOT TOGETHER, DON'T YOU THINK? AM I REALLY THE FIRST ONE TO SUGGEST THIS? I'VE LET ON THAT I UNDERSTAND OUTSIDE, DINNER/EAT, AND GO/WALK. IN FACT, I GET VISIBLY EXCITED WHEN THEY LET THE MAGIC WORDS SLIP. AS FOR THE GREAT METAL BEAST (CAR), GETTING IN AND OUT OF THAT WAS HARD AT THE START, BUT NOW IT'S A NO-STRESS HOP IN AND OUT. I ENJOY STANDING ON MY BACK LEGS AND LOOKING OUT THE REAR WINDOW. DON'T WE ALL? AT MINNEHAHA FALLS PARK, I FOLLOWED MY BRO CARNOT INTO THE CREEK. DIDNT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF CREEK WATER. SWAM AGAINST THE CURRENT AND DID A BIT OF ROCK HOPPING BEFORE CHILLING OUT IN THE SHALLOW END. I THOUGHT I'D HAD ENOUGH, BUT LATER DURING THE PARK WALK I PLUNGED INTO THE CREEK AGAIN! WHO KNEW? LIKE CARNOT, I PREFER REAL WATER OVER BATH WATER. MUST BE THE WHOLE CALL OF THE WILD THING, WOLF WITHIN AND ALL OF THAT STUFF. NOW. ABOUT THAT SALAMI ICE CREAM
404	REVISE -- SHEPSHED DYNAMO ARE OUT OF THE FA CUP FOLLOWING A 4-1 DEFEAT AGAINST RUSHALL OLYMPIC. THE 1ST QUALIFYING ROUND MATCH HAD BE ON TUESDAY AFTER SATURDAYS GAME ENDED IN A GOALLESS TIE. DESPITE DYNAMO TAKING AN EARLY LEAD, RUSHALL, BACK ON THEIR OWN GROUND, PROVIDED A STERNER TEST AND IT IS OLYMPIC WHO WILL TRAVEL TO CORBY TOWN IN THE FA CUP 2ND QUALIFYING ROUND.  COPELAND WAS CONVICTED MURDER IN 1993 AND RECEIVED A 25-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. SHEPSHED WITH PORTER CLOSE IN THE EARLY MINUTES. THEN ON THREE MINUTES  IT COULD BE DEFINED AS A POSSIBLE GAME CHANGING INCIDENT. JAKE BETTS BACK PASS WAS CLEARED BY LAURIE PEARSON BUT WAS CAUGHT A LATE TACKLE FROM LUKE BENBOW. AFTER A LENGTHY DELAY WHILE PEARSON RECEIVED TREATMENT, SHEPSHED RESTARTED GOAL KICK FINDING PORTER WHO SHRUGGED OFF MITCHELL TOLLEY AND MOVED THE BALL INSIDE TO DUFFY.  THEN YOU HAVE THE PROSPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH ILLEGAL ALIENS FOR FARMS, ESPECIALLY IF A NEW PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS.  HIS THROUGH BALL FOUND REEVE TO SHOOT PAST DEAN COLEMAN TO GIVE SHEPSHED AN EARLY LEAD. THREE MINUTES LATER, PEARSON WAS UNABLE CONTINUE REPLACED BY ALEX DAVIES.  JOSH WANDELL AT SATURDAYS RACE FOR WANDELL. SHEPSHED CAME ON FIFTEEN MINUTES, REEVE AND COMBINING WELL BUT DUFFYS EFFORT WAS DEFLECTED OVER. SHEPSHED WERE TAKING THE GAME TO RUSHALL AND THEIR EFFORT OF NOTE WAS ON 17 MINUTES, ALEX REID FINDING LUKE BENBOW BUT HIS SHOT WENT WIDE.  RUSHALL BEGAN TO BREAK THE GAME AND BEGAN  TO EXERT THEIR HIGHER LEAGUE INFLUENCE, DAVIES SAVING FROM BENBOW ON 25 MINUTES AND AGAIN THREE MINUTES LATER. RUSHALL EQUALISED ON 37 MINUTES, A DIAGONAL BALL BY TOLLEY CAUGHT OUT THE SHEPSHED DEFENCE AND ROBERTS CURLED HIS RIGHT FOOT SHOT PAST DAVIES. THREE MINUTES LATER AND OLYMPIC WERE IN FRONT, THE BALL WAS FLICKED ON FROM A THROW IN AND ALEX REID HELD THE BALL UP, TURNED AND FIRED PAST DAVIES. SHEPSHED WERE UNLUCKY NOT TO LEVEL STRAIGHT FROM THE KICK OFF, REEVES EFFORT TIPPED ONTO THE POST FOR A CORNER BY COLEMAN. FOUR MINUTES INTO RUSHALL EXTENDED THEIR LEAD, REID LATCHING ONTO A THROUGH BALL TO SLOT PAST DAVIES. RUSHALL WERE BEGINNING TO CONTROL THE GAME AND ON 56 MINUTES A SPECULATIVE LOB FROM BENBOW WAS MET WITH A FIERCE VOLLEY BY REID FOR HIS TRICK. SHEPSHED DIDNT GIVE UP AND DUFFY WENT CLOSE WITH A FREE KICK AND MEADE WAS THEN DEEMED OFFSIDE. RUSHALL CONTINUED TO PRESS AND DAVIES PROVIDED A SUCCESSION OF FINE SAVES BEFORE SAM YOUNG BROUGHT DOWN MALACHITE FARQUHARSON FOR A PENALTY BUT DEBUTANTE REPLACEMENT DAVIES THE SHEPSHED GOAL WAS EQUAL TO REIDS SPOT KICK. RUSHALL WERE IN SEARCH OF A FIFTH WITH 12 MINUTES TO GO.  A FLEET OF 39 AIRCRAFT FLYING TO OVER 48 DESTINATIONS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST, EUROPE, ASIA AND AFRICA, OMAN AIR'S HOSPITALITY, COMFORT AND SPACE OFFER ALL CUSTOMERS A SEAMLESS PASSENGER EXPERIENCE, WHETHER THEY ARE TRAVELLING IN FIRST CLASS, BUSINESS CLASS OR ECONOMY CLASS. FARQUHARSONS HEADER LOOKED GOAL BOUND BUT DAVIES PULLED OFF FINE SAVE TO TIP THE BALL OVER THE TOP. ALTHOUGH THE GAME WAS OUT OF SHEPSHEDS REACH, THEY FINISHED THE GAME STRONG WITH ADAM HOHNS HEADER TIPPED OVER BY COLEMAN AND REEVES PULL BACK CLEARED. ONCE RUSHALL OLYMPIC HAD TAKEN THE LEAD, THEY USED THEIR HIGHER LEAGUE EXPERIENCE TO THEIR ADVANTAGE BUT SHEPSHED CAN TAKE A LOT FROM THE TWO GAMES. ATTENTIONS TURN BACK TO THE MIDLAND FOOTBALL ACTION AS THE TEAM TRAVEL TO HEREFORD ON SATURDAY. TUESDAYS LEAGUE CUP GAME AGAINST LOUGHBOROUGH UNI HAS BEEN REARRANGED AND WILL NOW TAKE PLACE AT THE DOVECOTE ON SEPTEMBER 29.
405	TOM ELLIS IN LONDON, AUGUST 2015. PHOTOS: MATT HOLYOAK . STYLING: NIC JOTTKANDT . GROOMING: LARRY KING FOR STREETERS. PHOTO ASSISTANTS: JACK DONCASTER AND SAM WILSON. IN LUCIFER , FOX'S 2016 DRAMEDY BASED ON THE GRAPHIC NOVELS BY NEIL GAIMAN, THE DEVIL IS MORE MISCHIEVOUS THAN CRUEL. HE LOOKS A BIT LIKE JAMES BONDOR PERHAPS A VILLAIN OUT OF JAGUAR'S "IT'S GOOD TO BE BAD" COMMERCIAL AND HAS THE MORALS OF A DEBAUCHED INVESTMENT BANKER (ALBEIT WITH A LITTLE MORE HEART). "I SUPPOSE HE'S KIND OF A CADDISH FIGURE," SAYS TOM ELLIS, WHO STARS AS LUCIFER MORNINGSTAR. "FOR ME, IT WAS APPARENT THAT HE WAS FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE CHARACTERS. HE READ LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A HIGH-STYLE THEATER PLAY BY OSCAR WILDE OR NOEL COWARD," HE CONTINUES. "THAT GIVE ME THE BACKBONE OF WHAT I WAS DOING, INFUSED WITH A BIT OF ROCK 'N' ROLL AND MICK JAGGER. YOU'VE GOT THIS KIND OF FLAMBOYANT CHARACTER AT THE END OF IT." NOW IN HIS MID-30S, ELLIS GREW UP IN THE U.K. AND WENT TO DRAMA SCHOOL AT THE ROYAL SCOTTISH ACADEMY IN GLASGOW WITH JAMES MCAVOY, SAM HEUGHAN , AND LAURA DONNELLY , AMONG OTHERS. HE'S SPENT MUCH OF HIS 15-YEAR CAREER ON TELEVISION; LAST YEAR HE STARRED AS ANOTHER SUAVE BAD-BOY ON U.S.A.'S RUSH , AND, FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, HE'S PLAYED GARY PRESTON IN THE CULT BRITISH COMEDY MIRANDA . WE RECENTLY SPOKE WITH ELLIS VIA THE PHONE. EMMA BROWN: CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU GOT INVOLVED IN LUCIFER ? TOM ELLIS: IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW SCRIPTS THAT I READ DURING PILOT SEASON THIS YEAR THAT, AS SOON AS I READ IT, I SAID, "THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO." IT WAS MUCH FUNNIER THAN ANYTHING THAT I HAD READ. I MET LEN WISEMAN, WHO HAD COME ON BOARD AS THE DIRECTOR. IT WAS INSTANTANEOUS FOR ME FROM THAT MOMENT. HE MADE IT QUITE APPARENT THAT HE WANTED ME TO DO IT, AND I REALLY WANTED TO DO THE PROJECT, SO IT WAS JUST ABOUT GETTING THE STUDIO AND EVERYONE ON BOARD. THAT CAME QUITE QUICKLY AS WELL. PILOT SEASON'S SUCH A STRANGE TIME. YOU GET SUCH A CONCENTRATED AMOUNT OF SCRIPTS. A LOT OF THEM BECOME WHITE NOISE AFTER A WHILE. WHEN SOMETHING REALLY POPS, IT BECOMES APPARENT VERY QUICKLY. I'M QUITE INSTINCTIVE ABOUT THAT. I KNOW, NORMALLY BY ABOUT 10 PAGES IN, WHETHER I WANT TO DO SOMETHING OR NOT. BROWN: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST PILOT SEASON? ELLIS: IT WAS BACK IN 2008. I DID A PILOT FOR FOX. THE MORE YOU DO, THE MORE YOU LEARN ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO GET OUT THE EXPERIENCE. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GO THERE JUST TO GET A JOB AND THAT'S NOT MY MOTIVATION ANY MORE. I WANT TO BE DOING THE RIGHT JOB. BROWN: WHEN DID YOU HAVE THAT REALIZATIONTHAT YOU WANTED TO DO THE RIGHT JOB? ELLIS: I'VE BEEN ACTING FOR 15 YEARS NOW, AND THE MORE YOU DO, THE MORE CONFIDENCE YOU GET ABOUT "THIS IS MY CAREER AND THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING." SINCE I'VE STARTED COMING TO THE STATES, I'VE HAD A REALLY GREAT RESPONSE. IT'S GIVEN ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE TO BE MORE JUDICIOUS ABOUT MY OWN CHOICES. I IMAGINE THAT'S PROBABLY HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. I'VE SORT OF GROWN INTO A MAN MYSELF. BROWN: DO YOU COME FROM AN ARTISTIC FAMILY? WAS BEING AN ACTOR A FEASIBLE GOAL FOR YOU? ELLIS: MY MUM WAS A MUSIC TEACHER. I'VE GOT THREE SISTERS AND WE ALL PLAYED INSTRUMENTS WHEN WE WERE KIDS. BROWN: WHAT DID YOU PLAY? ELLIS: I STARTED ON THE TRUMPET AND THEN I UPGRADED TO THE FRENCH HORN. I PLAYED IN ORCHESTRAS MY ENTIRE TEENAGE YEARS. BUT, ON THE DRAMA FRONT, NO, NOT REALLY. MY DAD, STRANGELY ENOUGH FOR THIS JOB, WAS A BAPTIST PASTOR, SO I GREW UP IN THE CHURCH AS WELL. I SUPPOSE THERE IS A DRAMATIC ELEMENT TO HIS JOB, AND HE ENJOYED DOING AMATEUR OPERATICS. BROWN: WERE YOU IN A NATIVITY PLAY? ELLIS: I WAS IN A NATIVITY PLAY, BUT BEING A SON OF THE PASTOR, I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO PLAY JOSEPH OR ANY OF THE BIG PARTS FOR POLITICAL REASONS. BROWN: WHAT DOES YOU FAMILY THINK OF THIS SHOW? ELLIS: THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET; THEY'VE SEEN THE TRAILER. THEY'RE ALL THRILLED THAT I'M DOING IT. IT'S ALREADY THROWN UP A BIT OF DEBATE, THIS SHOW. I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT TAKE THE SHOW IN THE SPIRIT IT'S MEANT TO BE RECEIVED WILL GET THE MOST OUT OF IT. ANYONE THAT'S PREDICTING IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING BEFORE EVEN SEEING IT IS A BIT FOOLISH, IN MY VIEW. THE SHOW CERTAINLY IS NOT A BIG THEOLOGICAL DEBATE. MORE THAN ANYTHING, I'D SAY THIS SHOW IS A STORY OF REDEMPTION. OBVIOUSLY ONE OF OUR MAIN SOURCE MATERIALS WAS THE GRAPHIC NOVEL THAT IT WAS BASED ON. BROWN: WERE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE GRAPHIC NOVEL BEFOREHAND? ELLIS: I WASN'T AT ALL ACTUALLY. I HAVE TO EMBARRASSINGLY ADMIT, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS BASED ON A GRAPHIC NOVEL UNTIL AFTER I GOT THE JOB AND I READ IT ON DEADLINE . I'M KIND OF GLAD I DIDN'T, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T AFFECT MY CHOICES AT FIRST. BROWN: WHEN YOU TOLD YOUR PARENTS YOU WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR, WHAT WAS THEIR REACTION? ELLIS: IT WAS QUITE LATE. IT WASN'T LIKE I TOLD THEM THIS WHEN I WAS 12 AND BLINDLY PUT THE REST OF MY EDUCATION TO ONE SIDE; IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I SORT OF STUMBLED ACROSS IN MY LATER SCHOOL YEARS. THEY WERE INFORMED BY MY DRAMA TEACHER, WHO I'M STILL FRIENDS WITH ACTUALLY. THERE WAS A PARENTS' EVENING AND THEY CAME IN AND MET HER, AND SHE WAS LIKE, "YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT LETTING TOM GO TO DRAMA SCHOOL." IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT SOMEONE HAD REALLY DONE THAT. SO THEY WERE QUIETLY SUPPORTIVE; THEY WERE NEVER STARRY PARENTS, GOING, "OUR KID'S GOING TO BE SUCH-AND-SUCH." THEY JUST LET ME GET ON WITH IT, AND I APPRECIATED THAT BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN ME A GOOD SORT OF WORK ETHIC. I DON'T FEEL ENTITLED TO ANYTHING. BROWN: WHAT MADE YOU CHOOSE TO GO TO DRAMA SCHOOL AT THE ROYAL SCOTTISH ACADEMY? ELLIS: I WAS LIMITED IN MY OPTIONS. I COULDN'T REALLY AFFORD TO BE A STUDENT IN LONDON. I HAD A FRIEND UP AT GLASGOW UNIVERSITY AND I WENT UP TO VISIT HIM AND JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH THE CITY. I THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING. BROWN: WAS YOUR PROGRAM MOSTLY THEATER BASED? ELLIS: YES, ALMOST COMPLETELY. THE WEIRD THING ABOUT DRAMA SCHOOL IS THAT YOU TRAIN FOR THREE YEARS FOR ONE THING AND THEN MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T TRAINED FOR THAT YOU END UP DOING. BROWN: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST JOB? ELLIS: MY FIRST PROFESSIONAL JOB WAS WHILE I WAS STILL AT DRAMA SCHOOL. MY BEST FRIEND IN MY YEAR WAS JAMES MCAVOY, AND JAMES AND I WERE GIVEN A TERM OFF TO GO AND DO A PANTOMIME IN SCOTLAND, WHICH WAS PART OF OUR CURRICULUM AT THE TIME. WE NEEDED TO DO A PANTOMIME AT THE SCHOOL, OR IF WE BOOKED A PROFESSIONAL GIG, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GO AND DO IT. SO WE WENT TO A PLACE CALLED KIRKCALDY AND DID BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. I WAS THE BEAST AND THE PRINCE. BROWN: WHO WAS JAMES? ELLIS: IN PANTOMIME THERE'S SORT OF THESE TOKEN CHARACTERS IN EACH SCRIPT. HE WAS THE YOUNG, SILLY CHARACTERSORT OF LIKE BUTTONS IN CINDERELLA. [ LAUGHS ] BROWN: IT'S NICE THAT YOU WERE ALLOWED TO GO OFF AND DO PROFESSIONAL GIGS. I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF DRAMA SCHOOLS DON'T WANT YOU TO DO ANYTHING PROFESSIONAL UNTIL YOU GRADUATE. ELLIS: I THINK WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE WITH OUR PRINCIPAL AT THE TIME. HE WAS VERY FORWARD-THINKING. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO GET YOUR STUDENTS OUT WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY. I ENDED UP LEAVING A TERM EARLY BECAUSE I GOT ANOTHER JOB. IT WAS QUITE A FLUID TRANSITION INTO WORKING, WHICH WAS MORE THAN I HOPED FOR. WHEN YOU'RE A DRAMA STUDENT, I THINK THE MOST YOU HOPE FOR IS TO MAKE A LIVING OUT OF ACTING. BROWN: WERE THEY QUITE ENCOURAGING AT SCHOOL? I SPOKE TO SAM HEUGHAN, WHO ALSO WENT TO RSA, AND HE SAID THAT ONE OF HIS PROFESSORS TOLD HIM HE COULDN'T ACT. ELLIS: I KNEW SAM AT DRAMA SCHOOL A LITTLE BIT. I'VE HAD THESE SORT OF CHATS WITH HIM BEFORE. MY EXPERIENCE WASN'T THAT. I FELT VERY ENCOURAGED, CERTAINLY BY A FEW KEY MEMBERS OF STAFF THERE. BUT I ALSO HAD PEOPLE WHOSE CONFIDENCE WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED AND TAKEN. IT'S A VERY VULNERABLE TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU GO TO DO SOMETHING LIFE THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF FRAGILE CONFIDENCE THERE. I KNOW SAM HAD A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE THAN I DID, BUT ULTIMATELY I WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH MY THREE YEARS THERE. BROWN: ONE OF YOUR FIRST FILMS WAS BUFFALO SOLDIERS WITH JOAQUIN PHOENIX, ANNA PAQUIN, AND ED HARRIS. YOU MUST HAVE BEEN 22. WHAT WAS THAT LIKE? ELLIS: IT WAS A VERY CHASTENING EXPERIENCE. I WENT OUT TO GERMANY TO DO IT. IT WAS A SMALL PART IN A BIG MOVIE, BUT I WAS THERE FOR SIX WEEKS. IT WAS GREAT TO BE A PART OF IT AND WORK WITH JOAQUIN, WHO WAS REALLY LOVELY AND VERY WELCOMING TO THE REST OF HIS CAST. WE HUNG OUT A BIT. THEN WHEN I WATCHED THE MOVIE MY THREE OR FOUR LINES IN IT HAD BEEN DUBBED BY ANOTHER ACTOR. I WAS LIKE, "OH. THAT'S INTERESTING. OKAY." THEY WEREN'T VERY CONFIDENT IN MY AMERICAN ACCENT, WHICH I WASN'T EITHER. IT WAS A LEARNING CURVE. BROWN: DID THEY TELL YOU AHEAD OF TIME? ELLIS: I REMEMBER ON THE SET, THE DIRECTOR WAS STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH MY ACCENT, AND I LOST MY CONFIDENCE A BIT. THEN I WENT TO WATCH IT UNINFORMED: "I'VE GOT A DIFFERENT VOICE..." BROWN: YOU'RE LIKE PHOEBE IN FRIENDS WHEN SHE WAS DUBBED OVER FOR THE "SMELLY CAT" VIDEO. ELLIS: EXACTLY. IT'S MY "SMELLY CAT" EXPERIENCE. LUCIFER WILL AIR ON FOX IN 2016.

THE SWISS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING BLATTER IS SUSPECTED OF CRIMINAL MISMANAGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OVER A TV RIGHTS DEAL HE SIGNED WITH FORMER CARIBBEAN FOOTBALL CHIEF JACK WARNER IN 2005. HE IS ALSO SUSPECTED OF 'A DISLOYAL PAYMENT' OF TWO MILLIONS SWISS FRANCS TO UEFA PRESIDENT MICHEL PLATINI - WHO IS THE FAVOURITE TO SUCCEED HIM - IN 2011. THE MOVE COMES JUST HOURS AFTER A PRESS CONFERENCE IN ZURICH AT WHICH BLATTER WAS SET TO SPEAK WAS MYSTERIOUSLY CANCELLED AT THE LAST MINUTE BY FOOTBALL'S EMBATTLED GOVERNING BODY. UNDER INVESTIGATION: THE SWISS ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS ANNOUNCED CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN OPENED AGAINST OUTGOING FIFA PRESIDENT SEPP BLATTER (PICTURED) A STATEMENT FROM THE SWISS ATTORNEY GENERAL READS: 'SWISS CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OF FIFA, MR. JOSEPH BLATTER, HAVE BEEN OPENED ON 24 SEPTEMBER 2015 ON SUSPICION OF CRIMINAL MISMANAGEMENT AND - ALTERNATIVELY - MISAPPROPRIATION. 'MR.

FIFA CANCELLED A PRESS CONFERENCE WITH PRESIDENT SEPP BLATTER - JUST MINUTES BEFORE IT WAS DUE TO START
407	ANDY NASELLI: A STUDY BIBLE IS A BOOK THAT INCLUDES THE FULL TEXT OF THE BIBLE PLUS ADDITIONAL FEATURES THAT HELP READERS BETTER UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE BIBLE. HOW SHOULD YOU USE A STUDY BIBLE? HERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT TO DO AND NOT DO. 1. DONT USE POOR STUDY BIBLES. IN GENERAL, ITS BETTER TO USE AN ALL-PURPOSE STUDY BIBLE RATHER THAN A NICHE STUDY BIBLE, SUCH AS ONE THAT TARGETS CAT LOVERS OR SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS WHO LIKE SKATEBOARDING AND GRUNGE MUSIC. SO AS A GENERAL RULE, IF THE TITLE OF THE STUDY BIBLE IS SOMETHING LIKE THE WINNIE THE POOH / THOMAS KINKADE STUDY BIBLE, TAKE A PASS. 2. USE QUALITY STUDY BIBLES. I JUST FINISHED ABOUT FIVE YEARS OF WORK ON A STUDY BIBLE THAT RECENTLY RELEASED: THE NIV ZONDERVAN STUDY BIBLE. (DON CARSON IS THE GENERAL EDITOR.) AS I HELPED TO EDIT THIS STUDY BIBLE, I CONSULTED MANY OTHER STUDY BIBLES. IN MY VIEW, THESE WERE THE FOUR BEST STUDY BIBLES AT THE TIME: ESV STUDY BIBLE, NIV STUDY BIBLE (WHICH IS REMAINING IN PRINT), HCSB STUDY BIBLE, AND NLT STUDY BIBLE. NOW I THINK THAT THE TOP TWO STUDY BIBLES AVAILABLE ARE THE ESV STUDY BIBLE AND THE NIV ZONDERVAN STUDY BIBLE. 3. DONT USE THE NOTES AS A CRUTCH OR SHORTCUT INSTEAD OF WRESTLING WITH THE TEXT ITSELF. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PRIMARY TEXT. ONE HOUR CAREFULLY READING AND MEDITATING ON THE BIBLE ITSELF IS WORTH TEN HOURS OF READING STUDY BIBLE NOTES. 4. DONT COMBINE THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOD-BREATHED TEXT WITH THE NOTES. GOD INSPIRED THE BIBLE. HE DIDNT INSPIRE THE COMMENTARY ON THE BIBLE. 5. USE A STUDY BIBLE IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WOULD RESPONSIBLY USE OTHER RESOURCES THAT HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE BIBLE. THERE ARE FIVE THEOLOGICAL DISCIPLINES, AND A GOOD STUDY BIBLE HELPS YOU WITH ALL OF THEM ESPECIALLY THE FIRST. 1. EXEGESIS. EXEGESIS DRAWS THE MEANING OUT OF A TEXT (THATS GOOD!), AND EISEGESIS READS A MEANING INTO A TEXT (THATS BAD!). IN OTHER WORDS, EXEGESIS INTERPRETS A TEXT BY ANALYZING WHAT THE AUTHOR INTENDED TO COMMUNICATE. EXEGESIS IS SIMPLY CAREFUL READING. THE TEXT MEANS WHAT THE TEXTS AUTHOR MEANT. EXEGETES ARE CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH INTERPRETING A TEXT, THAT IS, DISCOVERING WHAT THE AUTHOR MEANT. WHAT DOES THIS INVOLVE? GENRE. ESTABLISH RULES FOR INTERPRETING A PASSAGES STYLE OF LITERATURE. TEXTUAL CRITICISM. ESTABLISH THE ORIGINAL WORDING. TRANSLATION. TRANSLATE THE HEBREW, ARAMAIC, OR GREEK TEXT, AND COMPARE OTHER TRANSLATIONS. GREEK GRAMMAR. UNDERSTAND HOW SENTENCES COMMUNICATE WITH WORDS, PHRASES, AND CLAUSES. ARGUMENT DIAGRAM. TRACE THE LOGICAL ARGUMENT BY ARCING, BRACKETING, OR PHRASING. HISTORICAL-CULTURAL CONTEXT. UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION IN WHICH THE AUTHOR COMPOSED THE LITERATURE AND ANY HISTORICAL-CULTURAL DETAILS THAT THE AUTHOR MENTIONS OR PROBABLY ASSUMES. LITERARY CONTEXT. UNDERSTAND THE ROLE A PASSAGE PLAYS IN ITS WHOLE BOOK. WORD STUDIES. UNPACK KEY WORDS, PHRASES, AND CONCEPTS. A GOOD STUDY BIBLE TAKES ALL OF THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND HIGHLIGHTS WHAT IS MOST SIGNIFICANT FOR UNDERSTANDING BOOKS OF THE BIBLE AND PARTICULAR PASSAGES. THE INTRODUCTIONS TO EACH BOOK OF THE BIBLE EXPLAIN THE BROAD LITERARY CONTEXT AND RELEVANT HISTORICAL-CULTURAL CONTEXT, AND THE STUDY NOTES EXPLAIN INDIVIDUAL PARTS IN THAT LARGER CONTEXT. WHEN THE TEXT IS THE BIBLE, WE MUST NEVER STOP WITH EXEGESIS: WE MUST ALSO DO THEOLOGY BIBLICAL, HISTORICAL, SYSTEMATIC, AND PRACTICAL THEOLOGY. 2. BIBLICAL THEOLOGY. MAKE ORGANIC CONNECTIONS WITH THE WHOLE CANON ON ITS OWN TERMS, ACROSS THE STORYLINE OF THE BIBLE, ESPECIALLY REGARDING HOW THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS INTEGRATE AND CLIMAX IN CHRIST. (I TRY TO SHOW HOW HARRY POTTER ILLUSTRATES BIBLICAL THEOLOGY IN THE FOUR-MINUTE VIDEO BELOW.) THIS IS A MAIN DISTINCTIVE OF THE NIV ZONDERVAN STUDY BIBLE. 3. HISTORICAL THEOLOGY. SURVEY AND EVALUATE HOW SIGNIFICANT EXEGETES AND THEOLOGIANS HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE BIBLE AND THEOLOGY. 4. SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY. DISCERN HOW A PASSAGE THEOLOGICALLY COHERES WITH THE WHOLE BIBLE. THIS IS A MAJOR STRENGTH OF THE ESV STUDY BIBLE. 5. PRACTICAL THEOLOGY. APPLY THE TEXT TO YOURSELF, THE CHURCH, AND THE WORLD. QUALITY STUDY BIBLES ARE ONE OF THE MOST HELPFUL ALL-AROUND TOOLS YOU CAN USE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE BIBLE. SO BY ALL MEANS USE THEM (RESPONSIBLY) AS YOU FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE GOD-BREATHED TEXT.
408	VOLKSWAGEN'S SUPERVISORY BOARD HAS APPROVED A NEW MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE FOR THE GROUP AND THE BRANDS AS WELL AS FOR THE NORTH AMERICA REGION. THE MOVE CAME AS THE COMPANY REELED UNDER THE ONGOINGIMPACT OF THE DIESEL EMISSIONS SCANDAL AND APPOINTED A COMPANY VETERAN, MATTHIAS MULLER, AS NEW CEO TO REPLACE MARTIN VOLKSWAGEN'S SUPERVISORY BOARD HAS APPROVED A NEW MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE FOR THE GROUP AND THE BRANDS AS WELL AS FOR THE NORTH AMERICA REGION. THE MOVE CAME AS THE COMPANY REELED UNDER THE ONGOING IMPACT OF THE DIESEL EMISSIONS SCANDAL AND APPOINTED A COMPANY VETERAN, MATTHIAS MULLER, AS NEW CEO TO REPLACE MARTIN WINTERKORN. INTERIM CHAIRMAN OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD, BERTHOLD HUBER, SAID: THE NEW STRUCTURE STRENGTHENS THE BRANDS AND REGIONS, GIVES THE GROUP BOARD OF MANAGEMENT THE NECESSARY LEEWAY FOR STRATEGY AND STEERING WITHIN THE COMPANY, AND LAYS A FOCUS ON THE TARGETED DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE-ORIENTED FIELDS. THE SUPERVISORY BOARD DECIDED ON THE REORGANISATION OF THE GROUPS ACTIVITIES IN NORTH AMERICA. THE MARKETS IN THE USA, MEXICO, AND CANADA WILL BE COMBINED AND 'STRENGTHENED' TO FORM A NEW NORTH AMERICA REGION. EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, THE GROUPS ACTIVITIES IN THE REGION WILL BE LED BY PROF. DR. WINFRIED VAHLAND (58), FORMERLY CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT KODA, WHO IN THIS NEW ROLE BECOMES A MEMBER OF THE VOLKSWAGEN BRAND BOARD OF MANAGEMENT. PROF. VAHLANDS SUCCESSOR AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT KODA WILL BE BERNHARD MAIER (55), UNTIL NOW BOARD MEMBER FOR SALES AND MARKETING OF PORSCHE AG. MICHAEL HORN (52) REMAINS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF VOLKSWAGEN GROUP OF AMERICA (THERE WAS SOME SPECULATION THAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO GO). PORSCHE BRAND GROUP WITH BENTLEY AND BUGATTI VW SAID THAT AT GROUP LEVEL THE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE WILL BE ORIENTED MORE SYSTEMATICALLY TO THE MODULAR TOOLKITS. THESE TOOLKITS FEATURE STANDARDISED TECHNICAL COMPONENTS FOR EACH AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLE SEGMENT (VOLUME, PREMIUM, SPORT AND COMMERCIAL VEHICLES). CONSEQUENTLY, A PORSCHE BRAND GROUP WITH BENTLEY AND BUGATTI WILL BE ESTABLISHED FOR THE SPORTSCAR AND MID-ENGINE TOOLKIT. THE TOOLKIT STRATEGY WILL COME UNDER THE EVEN CLOSER GUIDANCE OF THE GROUP CEO; A SEPARATE DEPARTMENT WILL BE SET UP FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE AUDI BRAND GROUP WITH LAMBORGHINI AND DUCATI WILL BE CONTINUED AS WILL THE TRUCK HOLDING, AND THE POWER ENGINEERING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS LINES. THE VOLUME BRANDS VOLKSWAGEN (WITH PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MODULAR TRANSVERSE TOOLKIT), SEAT, AND KODA WILL BE REPRESENTED BY ONE MEMBER EACH IN THE GROUP BOARD OF MANAGEMENT. NEW GROUP FUNCTIONS FOR EFFICIENCY AND FUTURE-ORIENTED FIELDS VW SAID THAT GROUP FUNCTIONS WILL CONCENTRATE MORE CLOSELY ON EFFICIENCY AND FUTURE-ORIENTED FIELDS; ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS, FOR EXAMPLE FOR GROUP PRODUCT STRATEGY, NEW BUSINESS FIELDS, COOPERATIONS AND HOLDINGS, CONNECTED CAR ACTIVITIES, AND CO2 STEERING, WILL THEREFORE BE SET UP. ACCORDING TO HUBER, NEW, STRONG GROUP FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS FOR STANDARDISATION AND HARMONISED PRODUCTION PROCESSES, WILL LAY THE TIMELY FOUNDATIONS FOR EFFICIENT DECISION-MAKING. WE WILL BECOME FASTER AND MORE AGILE. FURTHERMORE, A CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER WILL ANALYSE AND, IF NECESSARY, CO-STEER TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS THROUGHOUT THE GROUP AS MANDATED BY THE GROUP BOARD OF MANAGEMENT. UPGRADING OF BRANDS AND REGIONS AT THE SAME TIME, EXISTING CORPORATE BODIES, STRUCTURES AND PROCESSES WILL BE STREAMLINED AT GROUP LEVEL, IN PARTICULAR BY STRENGTHENING THE BRANDS AND REGIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY. TO THAT END THE VOLKSWAGEN BRAND WILL INTRODUCE A MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE WITH FOUR REGIONS, EACH LED BY A LOCAL CEO WITH A DIRECT REPORTING LINE TO THE BRAND CHAIRMAN, HERBERT DIESS. STREAMLINING THE GROUP BOARD OF MANAGEMENT THE PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT AT GROUP LEVEL, UNTIL NOW LED BY THOMAS ULBRICH IN AN INTERIM CAPACITY, WILL BE ABOLISHED WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT. THIS IS ONE CONSEQUENCE OF DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BRANDS AND REGIONS. BERTHOLD HUBER COMMENTED: GOING FORWARD, THE BRANDS AND REGIONS WILL ALSO HAVE GREATER INDEPENDENCE WITH REGARD TO PRODUCTION. SO IT FOLLOWS THAT THEY SHOULD ALSO HOLD THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE ACTIVIT
409	I REMEMBER MY FIRST UNION JOB. IT WAS AT JEWEL FOOD STORES AND I WAS FORCED TO JOIN THE UNITED GROCERY WORKERS UNION. I WAS VERY PISSED OFF AT FIRST. THEY TOOK A DOLLAR OUT OF MY PAYCHECK EVERY WEEK AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT JUST WHAT THE HELL I GOT FOR THAT DOLLAR. AS FAR AS I COULD SEE, NOTHING. WHAT I DID KNOW, WAS THAT I WAS A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KID WHO MADE A HANDSOME DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE PER HOUR, AND I GOT A REQUIRED THIRTY MINUTE LUNCH BREAK. I'M SURE THERE WERE OTHER BENEFITS, BUT I WAS SIXTEEN AND ALL I NEEDED WAS THAT THIRTY MINUTE LUNCH. IT WASN'T THE ONLY UNION I EVER BELONGED TO. I ALSO BELONGED TO THE UNITED STEEL WORKERS UNION. VERY BUTCH SOUNDING, BUT THE JOB CONSISTED OF PACKING STEEL CANS IN RAILROAD BOXCARS, AND SEMI-TRUCK TRAILERS. THERE WERE NO STEEL MILLS BELCHING FIRE AND SMOKE. THAT JOB PAID AN ASTOUNDING THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR. FLASH FORWARD TO THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND THE UNION BUSTING RONALD REAGAN. LUCKILY, BY THAT TIME I HAD A GOOD JOB REPAIRING COMPUTERS. AS THE YEARS ROLLED ON THE UNIONS BECAME WEAKER AND WEAKER THANKS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE DUMBASS IDIOTS WHO CONSTANTLY VOTE AGAINST THEIR OWN SELF INTERESTS. SO NOW, RIGHT NOW, THE JOBS THAT ARE AVAILABLE SUCK. THEY DON'T PAY WELL AND THEY HAVE NO SECURITY. PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN MAKING ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A FAMILY OF THIRTEEN, NOW HAVE TO SCRATCH TO BARELY SUPPORT THEMSELVES. IN THIS DAY AND AGE, IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PEOPLE TAKE JOBS THAT ARE DEMEANING AND PAY FOR SHIT. YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, AROUND TWO, THE TELEPHONE RANG. I DID NOT HAVE MY GLASSES ON AND I COULD NOT READ THE CALLER ID, SO I PICKED UP THE PHONE COLD. "HELLO SIR, I'M CALLING FROM THE NATURAL GAS AND OIL..... " I DIDN'T EVEN GIVE HER A CHANCE TO FINISH HER PITCH. I DIDN'T CARE WHAT SHE WAS SELLING, OR WHO SHE WAS SHILLING FOR. I HAD MY OWN SMART ASS COMEBACK READY FOR HER. "HEY, I PRODUCE MY OWN NATURAL GAS. LOTS AND LOTS OF NATURAL GAS RIGHT OUT OF MY.. " I THOUGHT I WAS BEING SO CLEVER AND SO FUNNY. UNTIL I HEARD HER SCREAMING AT ME OVER MY HILARIOUS NATURAL GAS OUT OF MY BUTT BIT. "SHUT UP! YOU SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT THE FUCK UP!" I SHUT UP. THIS POOR WOMAN WAS OBVIOUSLY HAVING A HORRIBLE DAY, SO I JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP.
410	UPDATED: GOOD MORNING TRADERS, AS OF THIS WRITING 4:10 AM EST, HERES WHAT WE SEE: US DOLLAR: DOWN AT 96.240 THE US DOLLAR IS DOWN 183 TICKS AND TRADING AT 96.240. ENERGIES: OCTOBER CRUDE IS DOWN AT 46.20. FINANCIALS: THE SEPT 30 YEAR BOND IS UP 22 TICKS AND TRADING AT 156.21. INDICES: THE SEPT S&P 500 EMINI ES CONTRACT IS DWN 44  TICKS AND TRADING AT 1935.00. GOLD: THE OCTOBER GOLD CONTRACT IS TRADING DOWN AT 1123.80. GOLD IS 2 TICKS LOWER THAN ITS CLOSE. INITIAL CONCLUSION THIS IS NOT A CORRELATED MARKET. THE DOLLAR IS DOWN- AND OIL IS DOWN- WHICH IS NOT NORMAL AND THE 30 YEAR BOND IS TRADING HIGHER. THE FINANCIALS SHOULD ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH THE US DOLLAR SUCH THAT IF THE DOLLAR IS LOWER THEN BONDS SHULD FOLLOW AND VICE-VERSA. THE INDICES ARE DOWN ANDCRUDE IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED. GOLD IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED WITH THE US DOLLAR TRADING UP.  TO BETTER TRANSFER TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENTS MADE BY THE INSTITUTES AND UNIVERSITIES IN XI'AN, THE XI'AN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BUREAU AND THE ZONE ESTABLISHED THE XI'AN TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES MARKET IN 2011. I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT GOLD HAS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US DOLLAR AS WHEN THE US DOLLAR IS DOWN, GOLD TENDS TO RISE IN VALUE AND VICE-VERSA. THINK OF IT AS A SEESAW, WHEN ONE IS UP THE OTHER SHOULD BE DOWN. I POINT THIS OUT TO YOU TO MAKE YOU AWARE THAT WHEN WE DONT HAVE A CORRELATED MARKET, IT MEANS SOMETHING IS WRONG. AS TRADERS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS AND PROCEED WITH YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN. ALL OF ASIA TRADED LOWER. PLEASE NOTE THE CHINA EXCHANGES ARE CLOSED FOR A BANK HOLIDAY. AS OF THIS WRITING ALL OF EUROPE IS TRADING LOWER. POSSIBLE CHALLENGES TO TRADERS TODAY - FOMC MEMBER LACKER SPEAKS AT 8:10 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - AVERAGE HOURLY ARNINGS M/M IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - NON-FARM EMPLOYMENT CHANGE IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. -  UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. CURRENCIES YESTERDAY THE SWISS FRANC MADE ITS MOVE AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AFTER THE UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS NUMBERS CAME OUT. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND THAT TIME AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART BELOW THE USD GAVE A SIGNAL AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST, WHILE THE SWISS FRANC ALSO GAVE A SIGNAL AT JUST ABOUT THE SAME TIME. LOOK AT THE CHARTS BELOW AND YOULL SEE A PATTERN FOR BOTH ASSETS. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH. THESE CHARTS REPRESENT THE LATEST VERSION OF TREND FOLLOWING TRADES AND IVE CHANGED THE TIMEFRAME TO A RENKO CHART TO DISPLAY BETTER. THIS REPRESENTED A SHORTING OPPORTUNITY ON THE SWISS FRANC, AS A TRADER YOU COULD HAVE NETTED 20 PLUS TICKS ON THIS TRADE. WE ADDED A DONCHIAN CHANNEL TO THE CHARTS O SHOW THE SIGNALS MORE CLEARLY. REMEMBER EACH TICK ON THE SWISS FRAN IS EQUAL TO $12.50 VERSUS $10.00 THAT WE USUALLY SEE FOR CURRENCIES. CHARTS COURTESY OF TEND FOLLOWING TRADES BUIL ON A NINJA TRADER PLATFORM BIAS YESTERDAY WE SAID OUR BIAS WAS NEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER. THE MARKETS MEANDERED INTO AND OUT OF POSITIVE TERRITORY ALL SESSION LONG BUT THE DOW CLOSED HIGHER BY 24 POINTS HOWEVER THE NASDAQ DROPPED BY 17, THE S&P CLIMBED BY 2. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS JOBS FRIDAY OUR BIAS IS NEUTRAL. COULD THIS CHANGE? OF COURSE.  COMMENTARY YESTERDAY WE SAID OUR BIAS WAS NEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS (USD AND BONDS) WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER AND USUALLY THATS NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR AN UPSIDE DAY. WHAT WE DIDNT SEE WAS FOLLOW THRU ON THE PART OF THE INDICES HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS  JOBS FRIDAY WE WILL MAINTAIN A NEUTRAL BIAS AS WE ALWAYS DO FOR JOBS FRIDAY. WHY? BECAUSE THE MARKETS HAVE NEVER SHOWN ANY SENSE OF NORMALCY ON JOBS FRIDAY OR FOMC DAY HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS. YESTERDAYS UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS CAME IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED AT 282,000 VERSUS 273,000 EXPECTED. TIME WILL TELL IF THIS HAS ANY EFFECT ON NON-FARM PAYROLLS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE ITS A GIVEN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WE WORK HARD FOR WHATEVER WE HAVE; WE SHOULD TAKE TIME TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOR. !!!!
411	THOUSANDS OF ACRES, HUNDREDS OF HORSES. YESTERDAY, I FLEW MY HELICOPTER BACK TO THE WENATCHEE, WA AREA FROM SOME MAINTENANCE DONE IN HILLSBORO, OR. IN A PERFECT WORLD, THE WEATHER WOULD BE CLEAR AND THE AIR CALM AND I COULD FLY A DIRECT ROUTE THAT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 90-100 MINUTES. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW, THE WORLD IS NOT PERFECT AND, ONCE AGAIN, I HAD TO TAKE A LONGER ROUTE, THIS TIME TO SKIRT AROUND THE EDGE OF SOME VERY NASTY RAIN SHOWERS THAT STRETCHED WEST/EAST FROM MT. SAINT HELENS TO ROUTE 97 AND NORTH/SOUTH FROM MT. RAINIER TO THE COLUMBIA RIVER. A DIRECT ROUTE, WHICH IVE DONE TWICE BACK IN 2012 (SEE VIDEO), TAKES ME BETWEEN MT. SAINT HELENS AND MOUNT ADAMS. YESTERDAYS ROUTE HAD ME FOLLOWING THE COLUMBIA RIVER FROM VISTA HOUSE EAST OF TROUTDALE TO JUST PAST HOOD RIVER. FROM THERE, I HEADED NORTHEAST, RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE RAIN, KEEPING A SHARP EYE OUT FOR LIGHTNING THAT WOULD INDICATE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. ALTHOUGH I DIDNT SEE ANY FLASHES, RADAR IN FOREFLIGHT AND MY RADARUS APP CLEARLY SHOWED SOME VERY DENSE CELLS OFF MY LEFT SHOULDER ALL THE WAY AND THE RAIN WAS INTENSE. THE AIR I FLEW IN WAS REMARKABLY CALM, THOUGH, AND I ONLY FLEW THROUGH RAIN AS I FOLLOWED THE ROUTE OF ROUTE 97 NORTHEAST OF GOLDENDALE, WHERE IT GOES THROUGH A PASS. FROM THERE, I CUT AWAY FROM THE ROAD, AIMING FOR SUNNYSIDE. I MODIFIED MY ROUTE TO GO AROUND THE SOUTH-EAST CORNER OF THE RESTRICTED AREA NORTHEAST OF YAKIMA AND FLY HOME ALONG THE COLUMBIA RIVER FROM MATTAWA. HERES A ROUGH SKETCH OF MY ROUTE, DRAWN IN SKYVECTOR. THE RED BOX IS A TFR FOR FIREFIGHTING; ODDLY, THE RAINSTORMS WERE CENTERED RIGHT OVER THAT BOX. IT WAS OVER THE YAKAMA NATION (NOT A TYPO), BETWEEN ROUTE 97 AND ROUTE 12 THAT I SAW THE WILD HORSES. I KNEW THEY WERE OUT THERE, OF COURSE. YOU CAN OFTEN SEE HERDS FROM ROUTE 97 BETWEEN TOPPENISH AND GOLDENDALE. BUT EAST OF THE ROAD IS WHERE MOST OF THE HORSES SEEM TO LIVE. THE LAND FORMS THERE REMIND ME OF THE HOPI MESAS IN ARIZONA, LONG, FLAT, FINGER-LIKE MESAS STRETCHING TO THE SOUTHWEST, WHERE THE LAND DROPS OFF IN A STEEP SLOPE. THE HORSE HERDS ARE DOTTED MOSTLY ALONG THE MESA TOPS, ALTHOUGH I DID SEE A FEW HERDS IN BETWEEN. I FLEW OVER THEM, PERHAPS 300 FEET UP, AND WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO CLEARLY SEE THE COLORING OF THE HORSES I FEW NEAR. MOST HERDS SEEM TO INCLUDE A YOUNGSTER OR TWO WHO TOOK OFF, RUNNING BACK TO MAMA, WHEN HE/SHE HEARD ME COMING. WHEN I SAY THERE WERE HERDS OF WILD HORSES, IM NOT TALKING ABOUT TWO OR THREE HERDS. THERE WERE AT LEAST THAT MANY HERDS ON EACH OF THE MESAS I FLEW OVER. EACH HERD HAD 5 TO 20 HORSES IN IT AND I MUST HAVE SEEN AT LEAST 20 HERDS. THATS HUNDREDS OF HORSES. I HAD MY GOPRO NOSECAM GOING WHILE I FLEW. HERES ONE OF THE SHOTS CAPTURED ALONG THE WAY. THE VIDEO CLIPS SHOW HOW SOME HERDS IGNORED ME WHILE OTHERS TOOK OFF RUNNING AT THE SOUND OF MY APPROACH. AND NO, UNLIKE OTHER PILOTS A FAMOUS PHOENIX AREA NEWS PILOT COMES TO MIND I DONT CHASE THE HORSES WITH MY HELICOPTER. NOW SOME FOLKS WHO SEE THE HORSES ALONG THE ROAD SEEM TO THINK THAT THEYRE NOT WILD. THEY CONFUSE A NEW FENCE LIKELY ERECTED TO KEEP OPEN RANGE CATTLE OFF THE ROADWAY WITH A FENCE TO KEEP THE HORSES ON SOMEONES PROPERTY. BUT HAVING FLOWN OVER THE AREA, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THESE HORSES ARE NOT FENCED IN. I FLEW FOR MILES, COVERING THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF LAND, AND DIDNT SEE ANY HOMES OR RANCH BUILDINGS, NO FEEDING STATIONS, FEW TWO-TRACK ROADS, AND NO ADDITIONAL FENCING. THESE HORSES DONT BELONG TO ANY ONE PERSON. THEYRE WILD. LIKE THE WILD HORSES ON THE NAVAJO RESERVATION IN NORTHERN ARIZONA. OR THOSE ALONG THE VERDE AND SALT RIVERS NOT FAR FROM PHOENIX. OR THE ONES ALONG THE GILA RIVER, WEST OF CHANDLER, AZ. AND IN WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHER PLACES? SEEING THINGS LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THE PERKS OF BEING A HELICOPTER PILOT ABLE TO FLY IN SOME OF THIS COUNTRYS REMOTE AREAS. ID LOVE TO DO TOURS TO SHOW OFF THE WILD HORSE OF THE YAKAMA NATION. UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE SO MUCH OF THE INCREDIBLE SCENERY I GET TO FLY OVER ON LONG CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHTS, ITS JUST TOO FAR AWAY TO BE AFFORDABLE TO THE TYPICAL WENATCHEE SIGHTSEER.
412	GAINESVILLE - HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT RECEIVED NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR ITS NEW LOGO DESIGN PROJECT DURING LAST WEEK'S 3CMA CONFERENCE IN ATLANTA. 3CMA, THE CITY-COUNTY COMMUNICATIONS AND MARKETING ASSOCIATION, IS A NETWORK OF PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC COMMUNICATORS AND MARKETERS FROM ALL OVER THE NATION. THE ORGANIZATION'S ANNUAL SAVVY AWARDS COMPETITION RECOGNIZES OUTSTANDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACHIEVEMENTS IN COMMUNICATIONS, PUBLIC-SECTOR MARKETING AND CITIZEN-GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS. HALL COUNTY COMPETED AGAINST HUNDREDS OF ENTRIES FROM GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY - AND WAS PRESENTED WITH THE SILVER CIRCLE AWARD FOR THELOGO DESIGN PROJECT, WHICH WAS COMPLETED LAST YEAR. "THE LOGO DESIGN PROJECT WAS TRULY A GRASSROOTS EFFORT, LAUNCHED WITH THE INPUT OF CITIZENS AND EMPLOYEES," HALL COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR RANDY KNIGHTON SAID. "WE ARE HONORED TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE THOROUGH AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROCESS WE USED TO PRODUCE A QUALITY BRAND THAT TRULY EXEMPLIFIES HALL COUNTY'S UNIQUE ASSETS." THE LOGO FEATURES TWO FLOWING BLUE STRIPES, A SOFT GREEN ARC AND THE IMAGE OF A RISING YELLOW SUN, COMPLETE WITH "RAYS" IN THE SHAPE OF MECHANICAL COGS. EACH ELEMENT OF THE LOGO HIGHLIGHTS A DISTINCT CHARACTERISTIC OF HALL COUNTY. "THE BLUE STREAKS REPRESENT LAKE LANIER, AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF HALL COUNTY'S LANDSCAPE AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE," SAID KATIE CRUMLEY, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER FOR HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT. "THE BLUE LINES ALSO RESEMBLE ROADWAYS, GIVING A NOD TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE HALL COUNTY PROVIDES AND MAINTAINS FOR ITS CITIZENS." CRUMLEY SAID THE GREEN ARC IS REMINISCENT OF HALL COUNTY'S LOCATION AT THE FOOTHILLS OF THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS AND THE AREA'S RICH AGRICULTURAL HERITAGE. THE RISING SUN REPRESENTS THE COUNTY'S CURRENT STATE OF GROWTH AND POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. "THE MECHANICAL COGS SEEN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SUN ALSO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE FACT THAT HALL COUNTY IS MOVING FORWARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND THRIVE IN THE FUTURE," SHE SAID. THE JUDGES FOR THE 3CMA SAVVY COMPETITION PRAISED HALL COUNTY FOR CITIZEN AND EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT AND THEIR IMPRESSIVE BRAND IDENTITY STANDARD GUIDE. HALL COUNTY BEGAN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A NEW LOGO IN 2013 WITH A COUNTYWIDE SURVEY AVAILABLE ON THE COUNTY'S WEBSITE, HALLCOUNTY.ORG. THE SURVEY ASKED FOR FEEDBACK FROM HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND HALL COUNTY RESIDENTS ABOUT WHAT IMAGES, COLORS, FONTS AND MORE SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN THE NEW DESIGN. THE SURVEY ALSO ASKED WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN A FOCUS GROUP DEDICATED TO EXPOUNDING ON THE SURVEY RESPONSES. TWO FOCUS GROUPS, ONE INVOLVING CITIZENS AND ONE INVOLVING HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, WERE HELD TO GARNER MORE INPUT ON THE LOGO DESIGN AND SLOGAN. FOLLOWING THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CITIZEN AND EMPLOYEE INPUT, FORUM COMMUNICATIONS,A LOCAL FULL-SERVICE STRATEGIC MARKETING AGENCY , WAS HIRED AS A CONSULTANT FOR THE ACTUAL DESIGN OF THE LOGO. USING INPUT GENERATED FROM CITIZEN SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS, SEVERAL LOGO OPTIONS WERE DEVELOPED. THOSE OPTIONS WERE REVISED AND NARROWED DOWN BY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND HALL COUNTY STAFF UNTIL THE FINAL LOGO DESIGN WAS COMPLETE. THE NEW LOGO DESIGN AND SLOGAN WERE A PART OF A LARGER REBRANDING EFFORT, WHICH INCLUDED A REDESIGN OF THE COUNTY WEBSITE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONAL VALUES AND THE RELEASE OF A HALL COUNTY PROMOTIONAL VIDEO.

414	IN 2011 SFFS DEBT WAS $112 MILLION BUT IT BALLOONED TO $387M. AN AGGRESSIVE REPAYMENT PLAN WAS EXPECTED THIS YEAR TO SHRINK IT TO ABOUT $150 MILLION. SFF CHAIRMAN ROB HEWETT SAID THE MARKET PANICKED TO SECURE LAMBS FOLLOWING THAT HORROR SNOWSTORM BUT BY JANUARY 2012 PRICES COLLAPSED AND MARKETS SLOWED, LEADING TO A MASSIVE BUILD-UP OF INVENTORY. THAT INVENTORY HAD TO BE FUNDED, LEAVING SFF, IN PARTICULAR, BADLY EXPOSED. COLLECTIVELY, THE MEAT INDUSTRY LOST $200M THAT YEAR, HE SAID. SFF WAS ALSO COMMITTED TO REBUILDING ITS FIRE-DAMAGED TE AROHA BEEF WORKS, DECIDING TO INVEST $30M MORE THAN THE INSURANCE PAYOUT TO MAKE IT A STATE-OF-THE-ART PLANT. IT ALSO TRIED TO LOCK IN SUPPLY BY OFFERING FARMERS WHAT PROVED TO BE GENEROUS, LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR SHEEP MEAT AND BULL BEEF. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS CONTRACTING SUPPLY COST SFF $50M. THOSE COMMITMENTS HAVE FINALLY BEEN WOUND DOWN. OTHER COMMENTATORS ALSO POINT TO THE PROTRACTED AND BITTER 2004 BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF RICHMOND WHICH COST $150M AND CREATED AN ABUNDANCE OF ANIMOSITY AMONG NORTH ISLAND FARMERS. WHILE DEBT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE, HEWETT SAID A REVIEW IDENTIFIED ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE AS A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY. SPECIFICALLY, BANKS WANTED A STRONGER DEBT-EQUITY RATIO BECAUSE OF THEIR RISK EXPOSURE. HEWETT SAID THE ASSOCIATED UNCERTAINTY EVERY YEAR AFFECTED STAFF MORALE, CONFIDENCE AND THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND PLANS. THE MOVE TO CONSUMER-READY PRODUCTS IN ITS PLATE TO PASTURE STRATEGY HAS ALSO BEEN COSTLY AND WHILE SALES CONTRIBUTE 5% OF REVENUE, IT HAS BEEN A LONG PROCESS REQUIRING ONGOING INVESTMENT OF UP TO $4M A YEAR. SFF HAS TWICE PREVIOUSLY SOUGHT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO REDUCE DEBT, FUND NEW TECHNOLOGY AND ITS PLATE TO PASTURE CONSUMER RETAIL PACK STRATEGY. IN 2008 SHAREHOLDERS AGREED TO SELL HALF THE COMPANY TO PGG WRIGHTSON IN A $220M DEAL BROKERED BY THE LATE CRAIG NORGATE AND TWO DUNEDIN BUSINESS BROTHERS BAIRD AND ALAN MCCONNON. ONE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT MOST BANKS DO NOT WANT TO LEND TERM DEBT TO MEAT COMPANIES. ROSS HYLAND MIE THE DEAL WOULD HAVE SEEN PGG WRIGHTSON TAKE A HALF SHARE IN THE COMPANY AND SOURCE STOCK FOR SFF, ALLOWING THE MEAT CO-OPERATIVE TO RETIRE DEBT, SAVING IT $20M A YEAR IN INTEREST COSTS, AND INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGY AND MARKETING. BUT THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS INTERVENED AND PGG WRIGHTSON COULDNT RAISE THE MONEY. A SETTLEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED IN WHICH PGG WRIGHTSON PAID SFF $25M AND ISSUED IT WITH 10M ORDINARY SHARES. IRONICALLY, THE MONEY WAS SOURCED FROM SOUTH CANTERBURY FINANCE, WHICH LATER COLLAPSED BECAUSE OF DEBT. A YEAR LATER SFF WENT TO SHAREHOLDERS WITH A NEW CAPITAL STRUCTURE OFFER, SEEKING $80M BUT HOPING FOR $128M. IT SECURED JUST $22M. THE FUNDS WOULD HAVE RETIRED $70M IN MATURING BONDS AND ALLOWED INVESTMENT OF BETWEEN $25M AND $30M FOR X-RAY CARCASE IMAGING AND ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGY. ON AT LEAST TWO OCCASIONS SERIOUS CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO A MERGER WITH ALLIANCE GROUP. SFF WALKED AWAY FROM MERGER TALKS WITH ALLIANCE IN 2007 WHEN THE INVERCARGILL CO-OPERATIVE VALUED SFF AT VIRTUALLY NOTHING. A YEAR LATER SFF WALKED AWAY AGAIN FROM A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD HAVE LOCKED UP ABOUT 80% OF THE NATIONS RED MEAT PROCESSING SAYING CONCESSIONS ALLOWING OTHER COMPANIES TO EXEMPT PRODUCT WOULD HAVE UNDERMINED ITS EFFECTIVENESS. THAT LACK OF PROFITABILITY AND PERCEIVED RISK PLAGUES THE MEAT INDUSTRY AND LIMITS ITS ABILITY TO SECURE LONG-TERM FUNDING, MEAT INDUSTRY EXCELLENCE ADVISER ROSS HYLAND SAYS. ONE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT MOST BANKS DO NOT WANT TO LEND TERM DEBT TO MEAT COMPANIES. AS A RESULT COMPANIES WERE LIMITED IN WHERE THEY COULD SOURCE FUNDING AND WERE FORCED TO PAY PREMIUM INTEREST RATES, HE SAID. BECAUSE OF ITS SCALE, LACK OF RISK BY HAVING CONTRACTED SUPPLY AND GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS, INVESTORS VIEWED FONTERRA DIFFERENTLY AND IT WASNT RELIANT ON TRADING BANKS BUT COULD GET FUNDING, SUCH AS BONDS, FROM INTERNATIONAL EQUITY MARKETS. HYLAND SAID UNPAID SEASONAL FINANCE WAS OFTEN ROLLED OVER INTO TERM DEBT WHICH WAS PAID DOWN IN A GOOD YEAR BUT LOW MARGINS MEANT IT BUILT UP AGAIN.

417	THERE WAS AN INTERESTING EPISODE OF BETH AND DOG ON THE BIG HUNT (OR WHATEVER IT'S CALLED) WHERE THEY WERE HELPING THE USUAL CLUELESS HAPLESS CHEFTESTANTS, SEENWANDERING AROUND IN CIRCLES HAEMORRHAGING CASH MONEY BEFORE THE DOG TEAM CAME IN TO "FIX" THEM. ONE GUY IN THIS PARTICULAR CLOWN SHOE WEARER'S GALLERY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS A SPECIAL OLYMPIAN PAR EXCELLENCE BY SOMETHING HE SAID. HE WAS ONE OF THE AUXILIARY BUNGLERS ON A TEAM OF CLOWNFISH. STILL, WHEN HE WAS INTRODUCED TO DOG, HE BOLDLY SHOOK HIS HAND AND SAID WITH BLARING PRIDE, "THE NAME IS GUY CANTERO SENIOR, BAILBONDSMAN." WHO INTRODUCES THEMSELVES, WHO EVEN STYLES THEMSELVES, AS "SENIOR"? A SMALL MAN WITH A LARGE PROBLEM IT SEEMS! A MAN WITH A SON WITH THE SAME NAME AS HIM. IN OTHER WORDS, A MAN WITH A SWAGGERING EGO. PEEWITALSO HAD A GOATEE AND A PONYTAIL, WAS IN HIS LATE THIRTIES. HE LOOKED LIKE HE'D JUST WALKED OUT OF THE COMICS SHOP AFTER ACQUIRING A $3000 "STATUE" OF "NEIL GAIMAN'S ANGELA" ("MICHELANGELO'S DAVID"). DOG SAID, "GUY, NICE TO MEET YOU, HEARD ABOUT YOU." HE WAS PARING HIS NAILS AND SPITTING A PLUG OF TOBACCO WHEN HE SAID IT, BUT HE SAID IT.LATER OF COURSE DOG CALLED HIM SIMPLY "YOUR GUY," AND YOU COULD SEE THAT DUANE'S EASY, FREEWHEELING FORGETTING OF THE GUY'S NAME REALLY STUNG AND RANKLED OLD GUY CANTERO SENIOR. HE WAS REALLY MIFFED!! HE TURNED TO THE CAMERA AND SAID, "THAT ESPECIALLY HURTS MY FEELINGS BECAUSE MY NAME IS GUY GUY CANTERO, SENIOR AND DOG SORT-OF SEMI-FORGOT IT. WELL NO LET'S CALL A SPADE A SPADE, HE ACTUALLY A HUNDRED PER CENT FORGOT MY NAME! AND AS IT HAPPENS I AM VERY DEFENSIVE AND SENSITIVE ABOUT MY NAME, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT I POINTEDLY ADD THE NAME "SENIOR" TO IT WHEN I SAY IT. AND NOW HERE COMES DOG ACTING LIKE I'M NOT A BIG FUCKING DEAL AT ALL, LIKE I'M NOT WORTHY OF A NAME, LIKE I'VE BEEN KIDDING MYSELF ALL MY LIFE. AW GEEZ." THE CAMERA WAS NOT RUNNING AT THE TIME. DOG WAS IN L.A. THAT WEEK. HE TURNS UP AT THE HEIGHT OF NOON IN L.A. WEARING A FULL-LENGTH TRENCHCOAT. SWEAT MUCH?SHREWD THINKING BOUNTY-MAN. I'D LOVE TO SEE THE "GAG REEL" OF SOME OF THESE EPISODES DOG WILTING FROM THE HEAT, COLLAPSING IN THE STREET FROM HEAT SICKNESS, COUGHING UP HIS TUBERCULAR LUNGS, GRASPING MADLY FOR HIS INHALER.
418	WATERLOO THE MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS FORMER FIVE POINTS CORRECTIONAL FACILITY INMATE WILL GO ON TRIAL IN NOVEMBER. SENECA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY BARRY PORSCH SAID JURY SELECTION IN THE TRIAL OF BRIAN KARRIS WILL OCCUR NOV. 13. OPENING STATEMENTS AND TESTIMONY BEGIN OCT. 16. PORSCH IS PROSECUTING THE CASE. HE SAID HE EXPECTS THE TRIAL TO LAST ABOUT FIVE DAYS. KARRIS, 38, IS CHARGED WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN THE DEC. 14, 2013, DEATH OF THOMAS BLANCKE AT THE MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON IN ROMULUS. CORRECTIONS OFFICERS FOUND BLANCKE, 24, DEAD AT ABOUT 6 A.M. IN THE CELL HE SHARED WITH KARRIS. ATTORNEY ROME CANZANO OF AUBURN, A FORMER PROSECUTOR WITH THE CAYUGA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE, IS REPRESENTING KARRIS. SENECA COUNTY JUDGE DENNIS BENDER IS PRESIDING OVER THE CASE. DURING A SUPPRESSION HEARING EARLIER THIS YEAR, A SENIOR CORRECTIONS OFFICER SAID HE WENT TO THE CELL AFTER ANOTHER OFFICER TOLD HIM SOMETHING WAS WRONG. ANTHONY EDICK SAID BLANCKE WASNT BREATHING WHEN HE ARRIVED. THE JURY WILL SEE A 35-MINUTE INTERVIEW BETWEEN KARRIS AND CIVILIAN OFFICIALS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES; THE LATTER QUESTIONED KARRIS AFTER THE INCIDENT. ON THE VIDEOTAPE, KARRIS SAID HE AND BLANCKE FOUGHT BECAUSE BLANCKE TOOK HIS MATTRESS, SAYING WHEN HE WENT TO HIS CELL FOR THE NIGHT, BLANCKE HAD PLACED IT UNDER HIS OWN BEDDING. IN AN INTERVIEW THAT WAS RAMBLING AT TIMES, KARRIS SAID THE ARGUMENT BECAME HEATED ABOUT 3:30 A.M. AND TURNED PHYSICAL WHEN BLANCKE REFUSED TO RELINQUISH THE MATTRESS. KARRIS CLAIMED BLANCKE STARTED THE FIGHT. AT ONE POINT, KARRIS SAID BLANCKE HAD HIM IN A CHOKEHOLD. HE SAID HE EVENTUALLY PUNCHED BLANCKE IN THE FACE AND LATER STOMPED HIS HEAD. HE WAS CHOKING ME TO DEATH, KARRIS SAID DURING THE INTERVIEW. I SAID, ITS DO OR DIE ... SO I SUBDUED HIM. I DID NOT WANT TO KILL HIM. IT DIDNT HAVE TO COME TO THIS. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT BLANCKE WAS INJURED BADLY, KARRIS SAID HE DIDNT KNOW HE WAS DEAD UNTIL LATER THAT DAY. KARRIS WAS MOVED OUT OF FIVE POINTS FOLLOWING BLANCKES DEATH AND IS NOW INCARCERATED AT ELMIRA CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. CANZANO SAID HE INTENDED TO CHALLENGE THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE VIDEO FOR TRIAL. HOWEVER, HE ADDED THAT KARRIS SAW IT AND HE CONSENTED FOR IT TO BE SHOWN TO THE JURY.
419	KICKOFF: SATURDAY, 10:30 P.M. ET GAMEDATE: 9/26/15 SITE: SUN DEVIL STADIUM, TEMPE, ARIZ. TV: ESPN SERIES: USC LEADS ARIZONA STATE 19-12, WHICH INCLUDES ONE VICTORY THAT WAS LATER VACATED BECAUSE OF NCAA SANCTIONS. THE SUN DEVILS HAVE WON THREE OF THE PAST FOUR MEETINGS, INCLUDING A 38-34 WIN LAST YEAR ON A HAIL MARY PASS IN THE COLISEUM. RANKINGS: USC 19TH KEYS TO THE GAME USC HEADS TO ARIZONA STATE THIS WEEK IN DESPERATION MODE. IT MIGHT BE TOO EARLY TO PRESS THE PANIC BUTTON AFTER THE TROJANS WERE UPSET IN THE CONFERENCE OPENER, 41-31 AT HOME TO STANFORD, BUT THEIR MARGIN OF ERROR IN THE CHASE FOR THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF VERY LIKELY HAS VANISHED. SO, TOO, MIGHT HOPES OF THE WINNING THE PAC-12 SOUTH IF IT DROPS TO 0-2. "THERE'S OBVIOUSLY STILL A BAD TASTE IN OUR MOUTH BUT I THINK OUR PLAYERS UNDERSTAND THERE'S PLENTY LEFT OUT THERE FOR US THIS SEASON, A GREAT DEAL THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH," COACH STEVE SARKISIAN SAID. USC STILL HAS THE PIECES TO BE GREAT, AND SARKISIAN WAS IN A STAY-THE-COURSE MODE, EVEN AFTER THE DEFENSE WAS GASHED BY STANFORD. "THE NATURAL THING IS TO PANIC, TO ALL OF A SUDDEN SCRAP ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF AND TRY SOMETHING NEW," SARKISIAN SAID. "AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS THING TO DO. WE HAVE TO BELIEVE AND TRUST IN THE WORK WE'VE PUT IN TO GET TO THIS POINT. "THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS, THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO PLAY TO THE STRENGTHS OF OUR TEAM. ... "WE'VE GOT GOOD SCHEMES. WE NEED TO PREPARE OUR PLAYERS BETTER SO THEY CAN GO OUT AND PERFORM BETTER." SARKISIAN MIGHT BE ON THINNER ICE THAN HE TYPICALLY WOULD BECAUSE OF HIS EMBARRASSING PRESEASON ALCOHOL-FUELED INCIDENT AT A BOOSTER EVENT, BUT HE'LL LEAN ON SOME RECENT HISTORY TO BOOST HIS CASE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF RESILIENCY. "I MADE A POINT TO THE TEAM THAT AT JUST ABOUT THIS POINT LAST YEAR, OHIO STATE HAS ALREADY LOST AT HOME TO VIRGINIA TECH AND ARIZONA IS ABOUT TO BEAT OREGON AT HOME," SARKISIAN SAID. "AND THOSE TWO TEAMS GO ON TO PLAY FOR THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. SO WE CAN REBOUND FROM THIS." PLAYERS TO WATCH TROJANS --WR JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER HAS BEEN UNSTOPPABLE SO FAR. THE SOPHOMORE HAS 22 CATCHES FOR 434 YARDS AND FOUR TOUCHDOWNS. ASU LIKES TO BE AGGRESSIVE IN ITS DEFENSE, WHICH MEANS THAT SMITH-SCHUSTER MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE JUST THE FIRST MAN MISS ON HIS WAY TO A BIG GAIN. --CB IMAN MARSHALL HAS PLAYED WELL AS A TRUE FRESHMAN, MAKING 14 TACKLES (THIRD ON THE TEAM) AND BREAKING UP TWO PASSES. HIS ABILITY TO MAKE AN IMPACT RIGHT AWAY CAN LESSEN THE BURDEN ON MULTI-PURPOSE THREAT ADOREE' JACKSON AND ALLOW THE TALENTED SOPHOMORE TO PLAY MORE AT WIDE RECEIVER, AS COACH STEVE SARKISIAN SEES FIT. MARSHALL GOT THE START LAST WEEK WHEN CB KEVON SEYMOUR (KNEE) COULDN'T GO. --RB TRE MADDEN IS THE TEAM'S LEADING RUSHER, BUT HE'S NURSING A KNEE INJURY SUFFERED IN LAST WEEK'S GAME AGAINST STANFORD, WHEN HE RUSHED NINE TIMES FOR 64 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN. HE WAS LIMITED IN PRACTICE EARLY IN THE WEEK. USC HAS A LOT OF DEPTH BEHIND HIM, BUT HE'D BE NICE TO HAVE AT FULL STRENGTH, AS THE OFT-INJURED SENIOR IS OFF TO A GOOD START, HAVING CARRIED 28 TIMES FOR 206 YARDS AND FOUR SCORES. SUN DEVILS --RB DEMARIO RICHARD, A SOPHOMORE, IS GOING TO BE A FORCE IN A LEAGUE ALREADY FILLED WITH STELLAR RUNNING BACKS. LAST WEEK AGAINST NEW MEXICO, HE ACCOUNTED FOR 255 TOTAL YARDS AS HE BECAME THE FIRST FBS PLAYER WITH 100 RUSHING YARDS AND 150 RECEIVING YARDS IN THE SAME GAME SINCE NORTH TEXAS' LANCE DUNBAR IN 2011. INCLUDED IN HIS BIG DAY WAS A 93-YARD TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION. "HE RUNS WITH AN ATTITUDE AND HE RUNS THROUGH THE TACKLES," SAID COACH TODD GRAHAM. --WR TIM WHITE, A JUNIOR COLLEGE TRANSFER SPEEDSTER, HAS BEEN A VALUABLE ADDITION TO A SUSPECT ARIZONA STATE RECEIVING CORPS THAT LOST JAELEN STRONG TO THE NFL AFTER LAST SEASON AND CAMERON SMITH TO A KNEE INJURY IN THE SPRING. WHITE HAS SIX CATCHES FOR 65 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS, AND HE ALSO HAS A 59-YARD RUN. --S JORDAN SIMONE IS TIED FOR THE TEAM LEAD WITH 29 TACKLES AND HE'S OFTEN IN ATTACK MODE IN COACH TODD GRAHAM'S AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE. SIMONE HAS 5.5 TACKLES FOR LOSS THROUGH THREE GAMES, AS WELL AS TWO INTERCEPTIONS.
420	BUDAPEST, HUNGARY T THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS AS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS FLOOD INTO COUNTRIES ACROSS EUROPE. ALL TIMES LOCAL (CET): --- 12:20 P.M. MOHAMMED, A 24-YEAR-OLD ECONOMIST FROM THE SYRIAN CITY OF ALEPPO, SAYS THE CHAOS AT BUDAPEST'S KELETI TRAIN STATION IS THE WORST HE HAS SEEN SINCE LEAVING SYRIA. HUNGARY ON TUESDAY SUSPENDED ALL RAIL TRAFFIC FROM THAT STATION AND CLEARED IT OF HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS TRYING TO BOARD TRAINS FOR AUSTRIA AND GERMANY AFTER SCUFFLES BROKE OUT. MOHAMMED SAID HE BOUGHT A TICKET TO MUNICH FOR 200 EUROS ($225) AFTER HUNGARIAN POLICE TOLD HIM MONDAY NIGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE. DESPITE SHOWING A SYRIAN PASSPORT TO POLICE GUARDING THE PLATFORM, THEY TOLD HIM TUESDAY HE COULD NOT GO THROUGH BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAVE A VISA FOR GERMANY. HE REFUSED TO GIVE HIS LAST NAME TO AN AP REPORTER BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT HIS FAMILY STILL IN ALEPPO. --- 12 NOON TENSIONS ARE FLARING ONCE AGAIN AT GREECE'S NORTHERN BORDER WITH MACEDONIA, WHERE ABOUT 1,500 MIGRANTS ARE WAITING TO CROSS THE BORDER AND HEAD NORTH TOWARD THE MORE PROSPEROUS EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES. FIGHTS AND SCUFFLES BROKE OUT TUESDAY AMONG THE CROWD NEAR THE GREEK VILLAGE OF IDOMENI WHEN HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, MAINLY FROM AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN, ATTEMPTED TO RUSH THE BORDER BEING GUARDED BY MACEDONIAN POLICE. MACEDONIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ALLOWING SMALL GROUPS TO CROSS AT A TIME AND HEAD TO THE GEVGELIJA TRAIN STATION. LAST MONTH, MACEDONIAN AUTHORITIES BRIEFLY HALTED ALL CROSSINGS AND USED STUN GRENADES AND BATONS TO PUSH BACK THE CROWD. --- 11:45 A.M. CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL SAYS GERMANY ISN'T TO BLAME FOR THE STREAM OF SYRIAN REFUGEES IN HUNGARY TRYING TO BOARD TRAINS HEADED FOR GERMANY. HUNGARY'S GOVERNMENT HAS PINPOINTED GERMANY'S "MORE FLEXIBLE ATTITUDE" TOWARD SYRIANS AS A PROBLEM THAT ENCOURAGES MIGRATION. GERMAN AUTHORITIES HAVE ADVISED OFFICIALS NOT TO SEND SYRIANS BACK TO THE FIRST EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRY WHERE THEY ARRIVED, AS EU RULES STIPULATE. MERKEL SAID TUESDAY THAT SYRIANS DO HAVE A HIGH CHANCE OF GETTING ASYLUM BUT "THAT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE ... AND SHOULD ACTUALLY BE SIMILAR IN EVERY EUROPEAN COUNTRY." MERKEL SAID "THE CURRENT RULES ARE CLEARLY NOT BEING PRACTICED." SHE SAID THE ANSWER IS A COMMON EUROPEAN ASYLUM POLICY WITH A "FAIR DISTRIBUTION" OF REFUGEES ACROSS THE 28-NATION EU. --- 11:20 A.M. HUNGARY HAS SUSPENDED ALL RAIL TRAFFIC FROM ITS MAIN TERMINAL IN BUDAPEST AND CLEARED THE TRAIN STATION OF HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS TRYING TO BOARD TRAINS FOR AUSTRIA AND GERMANY AFTER SCUFFLES BROKE OUT WHERE A TRAIN WAS TO LEAVE FOR VIENNA AND MUNICH. MIGRANTS CHANTING "FREEDOM! FREEDOM!" CONGREGATED OUTSIDE THE STATION AFTER BEING PUSHED OUT. POLICE ACTED AFTER AUTHORITIES ANNOUNCED OVER STATION LOUDSPEAKERS THAT ALL TRAINS WOULD BE STOPPED FROM LEAVING FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD. SCORES OF LOCALS, TOURISTS AND MIGRANTS WITH TRAVEL DOCUMENTS AND TICKETS REMAINED IN THE CAVERNOUS STATION, SOME STARING AT INFORMATION BOARDS STILL SHOWING ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE TIMES. --- 10:55 A.M. UNICEF SAYS THE NUMBER OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN FLEEING THROUGH MACEDONIA HAS TRIPLED IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS. THE U.N.'S CHILDREN'S AGENCY SAID TUESDAY SOME 3,000 PEOPLE ARE PASSING DAILY THROUGH THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC AND ROUGHLY ONE IN EIGHT IS A PREGNANT WOMAN. CITING MACEDONIAN FIGURES, UNICEF SAYS FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THE MIGRANTS COME FROM SYRIA. SINCE JUNE, MORE THAN 52,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED IN THE TOWN OF GEVGELIJA ON THE GREEK BORDER. THE AGENCY SAYS IT IS DISPATCHING SENDING WATER AND HUGE TENTS TO SKOPJE, THE MACEDONIAN CAPITAL. --- 10:45 A.M. GREECE'S COAST GUARD SAYS IT HAS RESCUED NEARLY 1,200 MIGRANTS FROM THE SEA OFF ITS EASTERN AEGEAN ISLANDS IN A SINGLE DAY, AS THE FLOOD OF PEOPLE FLEEING WAR AND POVERTY TO SEEK SHELTER IN THE EUROPEAN UNION CONTINUES UNABATED. THE COAST GUARD SAID TUESDAY IT HAD PICKED UP 1,192 PEOPLE IN 31 SEPARATE SEARCH-AND-RESCUE OPERATIONS FROM MONDAY MORNING TO TUESDAY MORNING OFF THE ISLANDS OF LESBOS, CHIOS, SAMOS, AGATHONISSI, FARMAKONISSI, KOS AND MEGISTI. THAT NUMBER IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE OF LATE, WHICH IS USUALLY IN THE HUNDREDS. THE NUMBERS DO NOT INCLUDE HUNDREDS MORE WHO REACH THE ISLANDS THEMSELVES FROM THE NEARBY TURKISH COAST EACH DAY, USUALLY IN OVERLOADED INFLATABLE DINGHIES.

WHAT IS THE BEST FACE WASH FOR CYSTIC ACNEH - DEEP ACNE CYST TREATMENTS THAT WORK.  I LOVE PINEAPPLE BY ITSELF, BUT MIXING PINEAPPLE AND POMEGRANATE TOGETHER IN A SMOOTHIE GIVES IS SWEET AND TART FLAVOR. I READ SOMEWHERE THAT ADULT ACNE WHICH WAS PERSISTENT WAS USUALLY CAUSED BY A HORMONAL IMBALANCE OR EVEN TO FUNGUS INFECTION INSIDE THE GUT CALLED CANDIDA. I REALLY HOPE THIS ARTICLE HAS HELPED YOU TOGETHER WITH POINTED YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TAKING VITAMINB7 (BIOTIN) PILLS MIGHT NOT INFLUENCE THE SKIN AT ALL, IT REALLY DEPENDS ON ONE'S BODY.

422	THERE ARE MANY COMPLICATED ISSUES WHERE I FIND MYSELF ON ONE SIDE, BUT WITH SYMPATHY FOR THE ARGUMENTS OF THOSE WITH WHOM I DISAGREE AND REGRET THAT I AM CHOOSING BETWEEN COMPETING VALUES. INCREASING FEDERAL SPENDING ON OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT ONE OF THEM. THE CASE FOR DOING SO IS NOT ONLY OVERWHELMING ON ITS OWN MERITS, IT IS ALSO A POWERFUL REFUTATION OF PRESIDENT REAGANS INAUGURAL LINE, WHICH HAS BECOME THE MANTRA OF AN INCREASINGLY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN PARTY: GOVERNMENT IS NOT THE ANSWER TO OUR PROBLEMS; GOVERNMENT IS THE PROBLEM. SOME ARGUE THERE ARE LARGE TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN THE GOALS OF INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY AND DIMINISHING INEQUALITY. WHILE I BELIEVE THIS IS GREATLY EXAGGERATED, IT IS A POLITICAL FACT, AND THE CURRENT PARTISAN ALIGNMENT IN CONGRESS MEANS THAT POLICIES THAT ALLOW US TO BYPASS THIS ARGUMENT ARE VALUABLE. A PROGRAM THAT PAYS WORKING MEN AND WOMEN DECENT WAGES TO REPAIR AND EXTEND HIGHWAYS, RAILROADS AND BRIDGES, THEREBY IMPROVING THE SPEED AND DIMINISHING THE STRESS WITH WHICH PEOPLE CAN GET TO THEIR JOBS AND THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS; MAKERS OF GOODS CAN GET THE INPUTS THEY NEED; AND PRODUCTS CAN BE DELIVERED TO CONSUMERS ADVANCES BOTH GOALS. AND WHILE IT DOES MORE THAN ANY OTHER SINGLE POLICY TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH THE PRIVATE SECTOR PRODUCES GOODS AND SERVICES AND IS CARRIED OUT NOT BY A FEDERAL WORKFORCE BUT BY EMPLOYEES OF PRIVATE-SECTOR BUSINESSES IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR ALONE. IF THE PROBLEM IS HOW TO HELP BUSINESSES DIMINISH THE MONEY LOST TO DELAYS, OBSTACLES AND UNCERTAINTIES CAUSED BY THE INCREASING DIFFICULTY OF GETTING PEOPLE AND THINGS FROM POINTS A, B AND C TO X, Y AND Z, THEN GOVERNMENT IS THE ANSWER. AND THAT MEANS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SOME CONSERVATIVES WHO GRUDGINGLY ACCEPT THE NEED FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION TO PROVIDE THE COLLECTIVE GOOD OF TRANSPORTATION HAVE ARGUED THAT THIS SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE STATES. BUT A POLICY OF BLOCK GRANTS FOR TRANSPORTATION TO THE STATES IS NOT A FUNCTIONAL SUBSTITUTE FOR PRESIDENT EISENHOWERS VISION IN 1954: THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM SUITABLE FOR THE NEEDS OF THE INTEGRATED NATIONAL ECONOMY THAT AMERICA HAD BECOME AS THE 20TH CENTURY PROGRESSED. SUBJECTING THE PLANNING FOR THE EFFICIENT FLOW OF PEOPLE AND GOODS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ENTIRELY TO THE UNCOORDINATED DECISIONS OF 50 STATES IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF ECONOMIC SENSE. PRODUCTIVITY WOULD NOT BE THE ONLY VICTIM OF A DECISION TO ABANDON THE DECISION OF 1787 TO REPLACE THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION WITH A UNIFIED NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN THIS CRITICAL AREA. EISENHOWERS APPROACH OFFERS US AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE PROGRESS ON DIMINISHING EXCESSIVE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY BY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF WELL-PAYING JOBS AVAILABLE TO MEN AND WOMEN WHO DO NOT HAVE ADVANCED DEGREES AND DO NOT HAVE HIGHLY DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGICAL SKILLS. AND THIS ISNT WORK THAT CAN BE SENT TO LOWER-WAGE COUNTRIES. YOU CANNOT REPAIR BRIDGES, EXPAND HIGHWAYS OR PUT IN PLACE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MASS TRANSPORTATION FROM OVERSEAS. AND THE SOCIAL PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST 60 YEARS ENHANCES THE BENEFITS THIS WILL BRING. WHITE WORKING-CLASS MEN WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMONG THE MAJOR BENEFICIARIES OF GREATLY EXPANDED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, BUT UNLIKE THE SITUATION IN 1954, WOMEN AND MINORITIES WILL BE PART OF THE WORKFORCE TOO. BUT THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING TO PROVIDE WELL-PAYING JOBS TO THE SECTOR OF THE POPULATION THAT HAS BEEN HARDEST HIT BY THE SHIFT IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR WEALTH IN RECENT DECADES WILL BE UNDERCUT IF WE SUBJECT IT TO THE INTERSTATE COMPETITION THAT IS PART OF THE CONSCIOUS STRATEGY OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO HOLD DOWN WAGES. THE REPUBLICAN ASSAULT ON THE DAVIS-BACON ACT WHICH WAS SPONSORED IN THE 1930S BY NORTHERN REPUBLICANS TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR CITIZENS FROM THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE EXERTED BY LOWER WAGES IN THE SOUTH IS A CLEAR INDICATION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF STATES GAIN TOTAL CONTROL OVER THE EXPENDITURE OF TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. THERE IS ONE LAST ASPECT OF THIS ISSUE THAT COUNTERS THE CONSERVATIVE ARGUMENT AGAINST SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY BENEFICIAL EFFORTS. WE CAN EASILY PAY FOR MUCH OF THE ADDITIONAL SPENDING BY CUTTING BACK ON ENORMOUSLY EXPENSIVE, COUNTERPRODUCTIVE MILITARY INTERVENTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, AN INCREASE OF A FEW CENTS IN THE GASOLINE TAX WOULD MAKE SENSE ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY. BUT EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE POLICY SHIFTS, HIGHER TRANSPORTATION SPENDING IS SOUND ECONOMIC POLICY. THE REFLEXIVE ARGUMENT THAT ANY INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL DEBT IS A THREAT TO OUR WELL-BEING IGNORES A CRUCIAL DISTINCTION. WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTION TO ADDING TO THE DEFICIT BY BORROWING MONEY TO SPEND ON CONSUMPTION THOUGH I BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF OUR CURRENT DEBT LEVEL IS GROSSLY EXAGGERATED BY THOSE WHOSE REAL OBJECTION TO THESE EXPENDITURES IS PHILOSOPHICAL BORROWING MONEY TO MAKE LONG-LASTING, PRODUCTIVITY-ENHANCING PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MATTER. WHEN FAMILIES, BUSINESSES AND OTHER PRIVATE ENTITIES INCUR DEBT TO ACQUIRE USEFUL ASSETS, THEIR BALANCE SHEETS REFLECT THE INCREASE IN THE LATTER. TREATING FEDERAL SPENDING AS IF FUNDS SPENT ON MAKING THE NATIONAL ECONOMY SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PRODUCTIVE HAVE NO OFFSETTING BENEFIT IS A GRAVE ERROR. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE NOW WHEN THE COST OF BORROWING IS SO LOW. EVEN WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM GOES AHEAD WITH THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES THAT IS NOW LIKELY THIS YEAR, THE PRICE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO PAY TO GET THE MONEY NECESSARY TO MAKE OUR NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM MORE NEARLY ADEQUATE TO OUR ECONOMIC NEEDS WILL BE FAR LESS THAN THE GREAT BENEFITS THAT WILL ACCRUE.

IF MY MEMORY IS CORRECT, THE BIRDS ALL DIE AS SOON AS THEYVE BEEN CATAPULTED AT THE PIGS, WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE WILL ACTUALLY TURN UP TO BE A SORROWFUL MEDITATION ON THE FUTILITY OF WAR.

425	NORFOLK CONSTABULARYS SAFER SCHOOLS PARTNERSHIP IS ROLLING OUT THE ANTI-VIOLENCE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM TO YEAR 9 STUDENTS IN ALMOST 50 SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTY BETWEEN NOW AND MARCH NEXT YEAR. THE PROGRAM, WHICH IS AIMED AT PUPILS AGED 13 AND 14, WAS STARTED AND IS PRESENTED BY ANN BARTLETT, THE MOTHER OF A SERVICEMAN WHO DIED AFTER A FIGHT IN A PORTSMOUTH PUB WHEN HE WAS KILLED BY ONE PUNCH. SHE SAID: ONE PUNCH CAN KILL WAS SET UP IN THE UK AFTER THE LOSS OF ONE OF MY OWN. 21 YEAR-OLD KYLE WAS INVOLVED IN A FIGHT WHILST ON A NIGHT OUT WITH FRIENDS. HE SUFFERED SEVERE HEAD INJURIES AND DIED LESS THAN 24 HOURS LATER. EVERY MONTH WE DISCOVER THAT THIS IS HAPPENING MORE AND MORE AND BY RAISING AWARENESS AND EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE EARLIER, WE MAY HELP TO LESSEN THESE TRAGIC SENSELESS DEATHS. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENTATION WILL BE TO ALERT YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE DANGERS OF FIGHTING AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES, THEREBY REDUCING VIOLENT CRIME IN SCHOOLS OR INVOLVING YOUNG PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL. INSPECTOR BEX BROWN, FROM THE SAFER SCHOOLS AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT TEAM, SAID: I AM THRILLED THAT THIS PRESENTATION HAS BEEN POSITIVELY TAKEN UP BY THE SCHOOLS IN NORFOLK. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF GETTING INTO FIGHTS. THE AIM OF THE PRESENTATION IS TO TRY AND PREVENT TRAGIC ACCIDENTS FROM HAPPENING IN THE PLAYGROUND AND TO SHOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF USING VIOLENCE RATHER THAN SPEAKING TO A RESPONSIBLE ADULT OR TEACHER TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. WE WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO RESPECT ONE ANOTHER AND IF A PROBLEM DOES ARISE, FOR THEM TO FEEL CONFIDENT TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND WALK AWAY. IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR DAVID WILLIAMS, 27, OF CROSSWAY TERRACE, ACLE, WAS JAILED FOR 27 MONTHS FOLLOWING A ONE PUNCH ATTACK IN NORWICH WHICH LEFT THE VICTIM HAVING TO BE PUT INTO AN INDUCED COMA BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE HEAD INJURIES HE RECEIVED. JACK CHEUNG HAD BEEN ENJOYING A NIGHT OUT IN THE CITY WITH FRIENDS AND WAS IN UPPER KING STREET, OUTSIDE ALL BAR ONE, WHEN HE WAS PUNCHED IN THE FACE IN AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK. MR CHEUNG SUFFERED A SERIOUS HEAD INJURY AFTER FALLING TO THE GROUND AND HITTING HIS HEAD ON THE PAVEMENT FOLLOWING THE ATTACK WHICH HAPPENED ON JULY 20 LAST YEAR. HE WAS TREATED BY PARAMEDICS AT THE SCENE AND WAS TAKEN TO THE NORFOLK AND NORWICH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL BEFORE BEING TRANSFERRED TO ADDENBROOKES HOSPITAL IN CAMBRIDGE, WHERE HE WAS PUT IN AN INDUCED COMA TO ALLOW HIS INJURIES TO BE TREATED. WILLIAMS WAS JAILED AFTER ADMITTING INFLICTING GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM. DO YOU HAVE A CRIME STORY? EMAIL PETER.WALSH @ARCHANT.CO.UK
426	DAVID FALES MADE HIS CASE TO BETHE BEARSTHIRD-STRING QUARTERBACK, THROWING TWO TOUCHDOWN PASSES, AND THETHEY CLOSED OUT THE PRESEASON WITH A 24-0 VICTORY OVER THE CLEVELAND BROWNS ON THURSDAY NIGHT.THE BEARS (3-1) HEAD INTO THEIR FIRST SEASON UNDER COACH JOHN FOX WITH SOME BIG HOLES AND A LONG LIST OF INJURIES, PARTICULARLY AT RECEIVER.FALES COMPLETED 14 OF 18 PASSES FOR 131 YARDS WITH JAY CUTLER GETTING THE NIGHT OFF AND BACKUP JIMMY CLAUSEN RECOVERING FROM A CONCUSSION.THE DEFENSE HAD SEVEN SACKS AND THREE TAKEAWAYS, HELPINGTHE BEARSPREVAIL ON A NIGHT WHEN BOTH TEAMS HELD OUT ALMOST ALL THEIR TOP PLAYERS. I THINK GUYS MADE CASES FOR THEMSELVES AND MADE IT HARDER ON US, WHICH I THINKS A GOOD THING, FOX SAID. TERRELLE PRYOR , TRYING TO SECURE A ROSTER SPOT AS A RECEIVER FOR CLEVELAND (1-3), DID LITTLE TO HELP HIS CAUSE.THE FORMER OHIO STATE QUARTERBACK STARTED THE SECOND HALF AND GOT CALLED FOR AN ILLEGAL FORMATION WHICH WAS DECLINED ON THE SECOND PLAY FROM SCRIMMAGE. HE TOOK A FEW SNAPS AT QUARTERBACK IN THE WILDCAT FORMATION, BUT DID NOT HAVE ANY PASSES THROWN HIS WAY. I THINK WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD SENSE OF WHO HE IS AND WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW IN HIS TRANSFORMATION FOR A LACK OF A BETTER WORD, BROWNS COACH MIKE PETTINE SAID. IT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE AN ITEM ON THE DOCKET TO BE DISCUSSED. THAD LEWIS HAD A DIFFICULT NIGHT FILLING IN AT QB FOR JOSH MCCOWN AND THE INJURED JOHNNY MANZIEL . HE GOT SACKED SIX TIMES AND HAD AN INTERCEPTION RETURNED 25 YARDS FOR A TOUCHDOWN BY SHERROD MARTIN IN THE THIRD QUARTER. FALES HIT VETERAN MARC MARIANI , ALSO TRYING TO SECURE A ROSTER SPOT, WITH A 19-YARD TOUCHDOWN IN THE SECOND QUARTER AFTER CLEVELAND TURNED THE BALL OVER DEEP INBEAR TERRITORY.IN THE THIRD, FALES MADE IT 14-0 WHEN HE FOUND IFY UMODU IN THE CORNER OF THE END ZONE FOR AN 11-YARD TD RIGHT AS A BLITZING TANK CARDER TOOK HIM DOWN. ITS NICE TO GET INTO A RHYTHM, FALES SAID. YOU DONT HAVE JUST ONE SERIES OR TWO SERIES AND YOU KIND OF FEEL IT OUT AND MAKE YOUR PLAYS WHEN ITS TIME TO MAKE YOUR PLAYS. BUT ITS DEFINITELY GOOD TO GET COMFORTABLE AND SEE WHATS GOING ON. THE QUESTION FOR THE BEARS IS WHETHER THEY HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO KEEP THREE QUARTERBACKS. IF SO, DO THEY GO WITH FALES? OR WITH ZAC DYSERT , WHO SIGNED TUESDAY WITHTHE BEARSAND PLAYED FOR FOX AND OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR ADAM GASE IN DENVER. DYSERT CAME INTO THE GAME IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND COMPLETED 1 OF 4 PASSES. WEVE GOT TOUGH DECISIONS TO MAKE AND WELL HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THAT, FOX SAID. ALSHON JEFFERY SAT OUT ALL FOUR PRESEASON GAMES BECAUSE OF A STRAINED LEFT CALF. HIS STATUS FOR THE OPENER AGAINST GREEN BAY IS IN QUESTION, AND FOX WASNT GIVING ANY HINTS. WERE GONNA PROBABLY SAY AS LITTLE AS WE CAN BECAUSE WE DONT REALLY WANT TO HELP OUR OPPONENT, FOX SAID. ROOKIE KEVIN WHITE , WHOM THE BEARS WERE COUNTING ON TO HELP MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS OF BRANDON MARSHALL , COULD MISS THE SEASON BECAUSE OF A SHIN INJURY.THE BEARS WEREALSO WITHOUT EDDIE ROYAL AND MARQUESS WILSON , WHO WERE NURSING SORE HAMSTRINGS.

434	TITLE: THE SECRET FIRE AUTHOR: C.J. DAUGHERTY AND CARINA ROZENFELD PUBLISHED BY: ATOM BOOKS PUBLICATION DATE: 3RDSEPTEMBER 2015 PAGES: 415 GENRES: YA FANTASY/PARANORMAL/ROMANCE FORMAT: PAPERBACK SOURCE: REVIEW COPY FROM THE PUBLISHER. BUY THE BOOK (WATERSTONES) | BUY THE BOOK (THE BOOK DEPOSITORY) TAYLOR MONTCLAIR IS A REGULAR GIRL FROM THE QUIET BACKWATER OF WOODBURY, ENGLAND. SACHA WINTERS IS A DARKLY MYSTERIOUS BOY FROM THE CITY OF LIGHTS - PARIS, FRANCE. WHILE TAYLOR IS FOCUSED ON HER DREAM OF ATTENDING OXFORD UNIVERSITY, SCHOOL COULDN'T BE FURTHER FROM SACHA'S MIND... SACHA KNOWS EXACTLY WHEN HE'S GOING TO DIE. HE'S DONE IT BEFORE. ON THE APPOINTED DAY, SACHA'S TIME WILL RUN OUT. AND HIS DEATH WILL FULFIL AN ANCIENT DESTINY THAT COULD UNLEASH CHAOS AND CATASTROPHE. TAYLOR IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN SAVE HIM. NEITHER OF THEM KNOW THAT YET. THEY HAVEN'T EVEN MET. HUNDREDS OF MILES AND A BODY OF WATER SEPARATE THEM. DEADLY FORCES WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO KEEP THEM APART. THEY HAVE EIGHT WEEKS TO FIND EACH OTHER AND UNRAVEL AN ANCIENT WEB OF MYSTERY AND DANGER. THE CLOCK STARTS NOW. INTRODUCING YOUR NEW OBSESSION,THE SECRET FIRE SERIES BY C.J. DAUGHERTY AND CARINA ROZENFELD. SACHA WINTERS IS CURSED. HE WILL DIE ON HIS EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY, JUST LIKE THE OTHER FIRST-BORN SONS IN HIS FAMILY. UNTIL THEN, HE CAN'T DIE. ACROSS THE CHANNEL, TAYLOR MONTCLAIR IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE HIM. BUT HOW? THIS BOOK IS EASILY THE BEST YA COLLABORATION I'VE COME ACROSS. IN ADDITION TO DAUGHERTY'S USUAL FANTASTIC WRITING, WE ALSO HAVE ROZENFELD, A NEW-TO-ME FRENCH AUTHOR. HER ENGLISH IS PERFECT AND I LOVE THE SOUND OF HER BOOKS. UNLIKE OTHER CO-AUTHORED BOOKS I'VE READ WHERE IT'S STARTLINGLY OBVIOUS WHERE ONE AUTHOR'S WRITING HAS STOPPED AND THE OTHER HAS BEGAN, THE SECRET FIRE IS ABSOLUTELY SEAMLESS AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT INSTANTLY. TAYLOR AND SACHA ARE SO INTERESTING AND THEIR PERSONALITIES EXCELLENTLY THOUGHT OUT. THEIR JOURNEY IS JUST BEGINNING AND I'M UNBELIEVABLY EXCITED TO SEE WHERE THEY END UP NEXT. THIS IS PERHAPS A SMALL THING, BUT I ALSO LIKED THAT THE SECRET FIRE SEES THE GIRL SAVING THE BOY RATHER THAN THE OTHER WAY ROUND. I DON'T THINK THAT HAPPENS OFTEN ENOUGH IN YA. ANOTHER THING I LOVED, WHICH I PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO MENTION AS YOU ALL KNOW I LOVE BOOKS THAT ALLOW ME TO TRAVEL, IS THAT THIS BOOK ALTERNATES BETWEEN SETTINGS IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE. #WANDERLUST. (YES, I DID JUST USE A HASHTAG IN A BLOG POST. SUE ME.) (DON'T.) THE REASON I DEDUCTED HALF A STAR (WELL, A HEART IF WE'RE BEING TECHNICAL) FROM MY RATING OF THE SECRET FIRE IS MY OWN FAULT, I THINK. I FOUND IT TOOK AGES FOR THIS BOOK TO GET GOING, SO TO SPEAK, BUT THE THING IS I WAS ONLY ABLE TO READ A FEW PAGES EVERY WEEK OR SO. AT THE TIME, I WAS IN A REALLY BAD READING SLUMP AND I WAS PROBABLY THE BUSIEST I'VE EVER BEEN, SO IT TOOK A RIDICULOUSLY LONG TIME TO READ. IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO READ IT IN ONE OR TWO SITTINGS LIKE USUAL, I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED IT MUCH MORE AND I DOUBT THE PACING WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK,AND IT'S GREAT IF YOU'VE JUST FINISHED THE NIGHT SCHOOL SERIES BUT DON'T WANT TO LET GO OF DAUGHERTY'S WRITING JUST YET. THE SECRET FIRE IS INTRIGUING, DIFFERENT AND COMPLETELY ENRAPTURING. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, AND I GET THE FEELING DAUGHERTY AND ROZENFELD WILL CONTINUE TO HURL MASSIVE SURPRISES AT US...
435	) - THE NEW YORK ISLANDERS HAVE UNVEILED THEIR BLACK AND WHITE THIRD JERSEY FOR THE TEAM'S INAUGURAL SEASON IN BROOKLYN. ON TUESDAY, NOV. 3, THE TEAM WILL DEBUT THE ENTIRE UNIFORM WHEN THEY TAKE ON THE NEW JERSEY DEVILS AT BARCLAYS CENTER. THE JERSEY IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE AT BOTH ISLANDERS PRO SHOPS, LOCATED AT ICEWORKS, THE OFFICIAL TEAM PRACTICE FACILITY IN SYOSSET AND AT THE PRO SHOP IN DIX HILLS PARK. FANS CAN ALSO PURCHASE THE JERSEY AT THE TEAM SHOP AT BARCLAYS CENTER. FOR INFORMATION ON PURCHASING THE JERSEY ONLINE, VISIT SHOP.NHL.COM . THE BLACK AND WHITE JERSEY, DESIGNED BY REEBOK, FEATURES THE ISLANDERS SECONDARY "NY" LOGO THAT ORIGINALLY DEBUTED ON THE TEAM'S STADIUM SERIES JERSEY IN 2014. FOUR STRIPES, PAYING HOMAGE TO THE FOUR STANLEY CUP CHAMPIONSHIPS, ARE A THEME THAT RESONATES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE UNIFORM. THE STRIPES ARE INCLUDED ON THE JERSEY'S FRONT CREST IN ORANGE, AND ON THE SLEEVES AND PLAYERS' SOCKS IN WHITE. "IT WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR PASSIONATE FAN BASE COULD STILL SEE THE TRADITIONS OF THE NEW YORK ISLANDERS REPRESENTED IN THIS THIRD JERSEY," ISLANDERS GENERAL MANAGER GARTH SNOW SAID. "WE FEEL WE'VE CREATED A JERSEY OUR PLAYERS WILL BE PROUD TO WEAR THAT HAS UNIQUE FEATURES WHICH WILL ALSO CONNECT WITH BROOKLYN RESIDENTS." THE BOTTOM OF THE JERSEY HAS WHITE TRIM WITH IDENTICAL "B" LOGOS ON EACH SIDE THAT WILL SERVE AS SECONDARY MARKS. THE "B", REPRESENTING THE ISLANDERS' HOME BOROUGH, WILL ALSO FEATURE THE FOUR ORANGE STRIPES THROUGH THE LETTER. THE HELMET WILL FEATURE A "BKLYN" LOGO, WITH FOUR ORANGE STRIPES THROUGH THE LETTER "Y". THE PLAYERS' GLOVES AND PANTS WILL ALSO BE BLACK AND WHITE. "WHILE BEING RESPECTFUL OF THE TRADITION OF THE ISLANDERS' CURRENT UNIFORMS, WE ARE THRILLED TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COLLABORATIVELY FIND A BALANCE THAT EMBRACES BROOKLYN WITH THE NEW THIRD JERSEY," SAID BARCLAYS CENTER CEO BRETT YORMARK. "THE COLORS OF BLACK AND WHITE INFUSE THE SPIRIT OF BROOKLYN INTO THE BOROUGH'S NEW HOME TEAM, WHILE THE FOUR STRIPES SEEN THROUGHOUT THE UNIFORM PAY HOMAGE TO THE ISLANDERS FAMED STANLEY CUP DYNASTY." ON THE RIGHT SHOULDER OF THE THIRD JERSEY, AS WELL AS THE CLASSIC HOME AND AWAY JERSEYS, THE TEAM WILL HAVE INAUGURAL SEASON PATCHES TO COMMEMORATE THE FIRST YEAR IN BROOKLYN. ON THE LEFT SHOULDER, THE ISLANDERS WILL RECOGNIZE THE GREATEST NHL COACH OF ALL-TIME, AL ARBOUR, WITH AN "AL" PATCH.
436	NEW YORK , SEPT. 30, 2015 /PRNEWSWIRE-USNEWSWIRE/ -- FLUORIDE ACTION NETWORK (FAN) HAS DELIVERED A 100-PAGE REPORT TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP ENTITLED "WATER FLUORIDATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE" OUTLINING THE DANGERS POSED BY THIS PRACTICE TO POOR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SINCE 1962 OFFICIALS AT THE U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE HAVE KNOWN THAT BLACKS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMED BY FLUORIDE WITH HIGHER RATES OF DENTAL FLUOROSIS (PERMANENT DAMAGE TO THE ENAMEL) RATES COMPARED TO WHITES. BUT FOR OVER 40 YEARS THEY HID THIS INFORMATION FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IN RESPONSE TO A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST, FAN DISCOVERED THAT IN 2005, 58% OF BLACKS HAD DENTAL FLUOROSIS COMPARED TO 32% OF WHITES. THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT NO FEDERAL AGENCY ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFETY OF THIS PROGRAM. INSTEAD THE DIVISION OF ORAL HEALTH AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) HAS BECOME A "ROGUE ELEPHANT" BLINDLY PROMOTING FLUORIDATION, DENYING ANY HARM AND FAILING MISERABLY TO PROVIDE ANY WARNINGS TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OF THEIR VULNERABILITIES. THIS HAS PROMPTED CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS TO CALL FOR CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS. ACCORDING TO FAN'S DIRECTOR, PAUL CONNETT , PHD, "THE SITUATION HAS BECOME MUCH WORSE NOW THAT IT IS CLEAR THAT FLUORIDE IS AN ENDOCRINE DISRUPTOR AND IS NEUROTOXIC. THERE ARE 45 STUDIES THAT FLUORIDE AT MODEST LEVELS LOWERS IQ IN CHILDREN ( WWW.FLUORIDEACTION.NET/ISSUES/HEALTH/BRAIN )." IN 2015 THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES ANNOUNCED A LOWERING OF THE FLUORIDE LEVEL IN FLUORIDATION PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, EVEN AT THE NEW LEVEL OF 0.7 PPM, BOTTLE-FED INFANTS IN FLUORIDATED COMMUNITIES RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY 100 TIMES MORE FLUORIDE THAN A BREAST-FED INFANT. FAN IS SEEKING FROM THE MULTI-AGENCY GROUP SUPPORT FOR 5-STEP COMMUNITY-BASED PLAN (ALONG THE LINES OF PROGRAMS FROM SCOTLAND AND DENMARK ), WHICH NOT ONLY PROTECTS TEETH, BUT BY EMPHASIZING BETTER NUTRITION ESPECIALLY LOWERED SUGAR INTAKE - FIGHTS OBESITY AND IMPROVES THE OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF CHILDREN FROM POOR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WITHOUT FORCING THEM TO DRINK FLUORIDATED WATER. AS A FIRST STEP FAN URGED THE MULTI-AGENCY GROUP TO CALL UPON THE EPA'S OFFICE OF WATER TO DETERMINE A SAFE REFERENCE DOSE FOR FLUORIDE THAT WOULD PROTECT ALL CHILDREN INCLUDING THE MOST VULNERABLE - FROM A LOWERED IQ. SUCH A DETERMINATION WOULD MAKE ADDING FLUORIDE TO PUBLIC WATER UNTHINKABLE.

439	KR: RIGHT, THE FETUS CONSTANTLY ADAPTS TO THE WOMB ENVIRONMENT AND PAYS THE PRICE FOR IT. THE FIRST ORDER IS SURVIVE AT ALL COSTS. THEN IF WERE FORTUNATE LATER, POSSIBLY THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO GO BACK AND TAKE CARE OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS, AND ALSO ITS THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO. NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL THEIR PAIN, NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL TERROR OR ANYTHING UNPLEASANT REALLY. THATS WHAT OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE ABOUT, DISTRACTING OURSELVES IN A THOUSAND WAYS FROM ALL THIS PAIN WERE CARRYING AROUND, WHICH KEEPS RELENTLESSLY SURGING TO BE MADE CONSCIOUS. DR. JANOV WRITES, THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA WHILE BEING CARRIED AND IN CHILDHOOD DIE IN AVERAGE TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THOSE RISK FACTORS. SO HERE THIS IS A GOOD ARGUMENT, FOR UNDERSTANDING AND RELIVING AND FEELING OUR PAIN, AND POSSIBLY EVEN HEALING BIG SECTIONS OF OUR HEARTS AND SOULS THAT ARE THERE WAS AN OLD BOOK THAT HE WROTE CALLED PRISONERS OF PAIN. THAT WERE ALL KIND OF HUGGED TIED BY OUR PAIN AND THE REPRESSION THAT WE USE TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT. JL: RIGHT, AND I THINK THIS CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF AFFECTS TOO IN TERMS OF HOW WE REPRESS OR HOW WE TRY TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE JUST AS BAD IF WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DIG PAST THE PAIN OR REPRESS IT THAT CREATES ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM, WHICH CAN THEN SHOW UP IN OTHER WAYS. THERE HASNT BEEN A LOT OF DEFINITIVE RESEARCH ON THIS, BUT DR. JANOV REALLY BELIEVES THAT THIS ALSO MAY BE BEHIND WHAT EVENTUALLY CAUSES CANCER, THIS SORT OF MASSIVE REPRESSION ON THE CELLULAR LEVEL THAT PREVENTS NATURAL GROWTH AND THEN OVERTIME CREATES CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES. KR: ID LIKE TO READ ANOTHER SHORT SECTION HERE, DR. JANOV WRITES, WHAT MOST OF MEDICINE AND PSYCHOTHERAPY INVOLVES TODAY IS THE TREATMENT OF FRAGMENTS OF THE HUMAN BEING. WE THEN GO ABOUT TREATING THE VARIED OFFSHOOTS FROM A CENTRAL IMPRINT, RATHER THAN THE IMPRINT ITSELF. TREATMENT BECOMES INTERMINABLE, WHAT WE GET IS A FRAGMENT OF PROGRESS, A CHANGE IN ASPECTS OF AN EARLY EXPERIENCE, RATHER THAN A HOLISTIC RECALIBRATION OR NEURO AND PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS CONNECTED WITH THE EXPERIENCE. JL: RIGHT. I THINK THATS REALLY TO KIND OF TAKE THAT AND KIND OF GO TIED IN WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYING COMPARISONS HE DRAWS IN THE BOOK TO SOMEBODY LIKE FREUD, THE RELATIONSHIP HE HAS WITH SOME OF THE EARLIER SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT PRECEDED HIM IS COMPLICATED. FREUD HE HAD THIS NOTION THAT HYSTERIA WAS ROOTED IN REPRESSED SEXUAL DESIRE AND HE OFTEN CHARTED IT IN DREAMS AND SORT OF THIS SYMBOLIC NOTION OF DREAMS. I THINK WHAT JANOV REALLY DOES IS HE TAKES, MUCH LIKE THOSE I THINK, THINKERS WHO DWELLED IN BIG IDEAS AND SORT OF PROFOUND CONCLUSIONS, HE SORT OF NOTES THAT WHILE FREUD WAS WORKING ON THE SYMBOLIC LABELS AND MISSED A LOT, HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS. INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOW THIS HYSTERIA WOULD CONSTANTLY BE UNREFLECTIVE AND PRONE TO OVERREACTION, AND JANOV WOULD SAY THAT YES THESE TRAITS EXIST, BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR SYMBOLS IN DREAMS, HELL LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF WHATS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN WERE HAVING NIGHTMARES. WHATS HAPPENING TO US BIOLOGICALLY WHEN WE HAVE A NIGHTMARE, OR WHAT DO WE FEEL DURING THAT TIME, AND WHY IS THAT TERROR COMING UP. HELL LOOK TO THE LIMBIC SYSTEM TO FIND WHERE THE TERROR IS ACTUALLY ROOTED. HES NOT TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THATS GOING TO CALM DOWN A PATIENT WHO HAS ADD OR DEPRESSION FOR THE DAY OR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. EVEN SOMETHING THAT MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO, HES REALLY LOOKING TO SOMETHING THAT CAN EVENTUALLY PROMOTE A CURE. KR: IM GOING TO READ ONE MORE PARAGRAPH OK? ON MY END DR. JANOV WRITES, THE BRAIN WE NEED TO ADDRESS DOESNT TALK, DOESNT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT DOESNT UNDERSTAND WORDS. IN FACT, THE TERM UNDERSTAND IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER, WE ARE NOT AFTER UNDERSTANDING IN THE INTELLECTUAL SENSE OF THE TERM, WE ARE AFTER INTEGRATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT CEREBRAL UNDERSTANDING. YES, UNDERSTANDING HELPS, BUT IT MUST NOT BE CONFUSED WITH RESOLVING, CONNECTING AND INTEGRATING. WHEN A THERAPIST TRIES TO GET A PATIENT TO REPORT ON HIS FEELINGS ALL MAY BE LOST, FOR THOSE FEELINGS MAY BE WORDLESS. TRYING TO EXPRESS THEM VERBALLY DISTANCES US FROM THE ORIGINS OF OUR PAIN IN THE LOWER BRAIN, AND SINCE ONE LAYER OF BRAIN TISSUE CANNOT DO THE WORK OF ANOTHER WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY TRUMPED OR EFFORTS, ONCE WE GET AWAY FROM WORDS WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT IS CURATIVE. UNDERSTANDING CAME LAST IN HUMAN EVOLUTION, LONG AFTER FEELING, AND IT WILL NOT LEAD US TO THE LONG TERM HEALING WE ARE AFTER. NONE OF THIS REQUIRES ABSTRACT OR ESOTERIC METHODS, WE CAN MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN SOCIETY JUST BY PAYING ATTENTION TO GESTATION AND CHANGING OUR BIRTH PRACTICES. JL: RIGHT, AND I MEAN I THINK THATS ONE OF THE BOOKS KEY CONCLUSIONS, IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT BIRTH PRACTICES AND LOOK AT A MOTHERS EMOTIONAL STATE AS NOT JUST NOT AT ALL INCIDENTAL. I THINK THE IDEA THAT FEELING IS CONNECTED TO OUR BIOLOGY AND HAS THESE SORT OF BIOLOGIC IMPLICATIONS, WE CAN SEE IT IN OUR BIOLOGY IS A PRETTY DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE FIELD. A FIELD THAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY TALK THERAPY AND BY APPROACHES REALLY FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS, NOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN. THATS WHERE I THINK DR. JANOV IS REALLY LOOKING TO GO. KR: WELL, IT EXCITES ME BECAUSE I THINK IT OPENS A HUGE DOOR. I THINK IT OPENS AN ENORMOUS DOOR OF UNDERSTANDING AND OF SUGGESTING VERY FUNDAMENTAL, NONE ESOTERIC, AS HE SAYS, SIMPLE BIRTH PRACTICES, PRACTICES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILD BIRTHING THAT CAN HAVE THE MOST DRAMATIC AND FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR HUMAN FUTURE. IT CAN PROBABLY DO MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE BILLABLE HOURS IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROFESSION. JL: YES, I THINK THERE WAS A CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK THAT CAME ABOUT LATER SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH PREGNANCY, AND I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME WORKING WITH DR. JANOV IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND JUST KIND OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE CONSTANT INFLUX OF NEW IDEAS AND RESEARCH HE WAS EXPOSING ME TO AND ALL THE WORK THAT WAS BEING DONE, IN THE FIELD OF EPIGENETICS AND IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL HEALTH AND NEW STUDIES HE WAS SHOWING ME ABOUT MEMORY AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE OTHER TOPICS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK REALLY STUCK WAS THIS IDEA ABOUT WHAT TO DO DURING PREGNANCY. AND HE ENDED UP SORT OF WRITING A CHAPTER ON PREGNANCY AND JUST OFFERING SOME ALMOST CONCRETE PIECES OF ADVICE FOR WOMEN THAT CAN HAVE SOME REALLY LASTING IMPLICATIONS. AS HE WRITES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OXYMORON FOR ME TO GIVE ADVICE SINCE I AM NOT BY PROFESSION NOR INTENTION AN AFICIONADO OF ADVICE. BUT LET US NOT MINIMIZE WHAT A CARRYING MOTHER CAN DO FOR THE GOOD OR BAD OF HER CHILD. IT IS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THAT HE APPROACHES THE SUBJECT, BECAUSE HE IS MALE AND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT IF YOURE SORT OF PROVIDING SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOW IT BEHAVED. BUT THINGS LIKE WATCHING YOUR STRESS; IF I CAN READ JUST A COUPLE PARTS OF THIS CHAPTER I THINK ITS REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE IS NO WAY TO ELIMINATE STRESS ENTIRELY, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS TO MANAGE IT. DONT PLAN A NEW BUSINESS OR START A SERIES OF COMPLICATED PROJECTS THAT PUT YOU UNDER STRESS WHILE PREGNANT. THE BABY WILL FEEL THIS ANXIETY AND SUFFER. TRY TO WORK OUT PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SPOUSE BEFORE YOU GET PREGNANT. ONCE YOU ARE PREGNANT, IT IS LARGELY TOO LATE. THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD NEVER ARGUE OR FIGHT AGAIN; BUT TRY TO RESOLVE THE MORE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES BEFORE YOU INTRODUCE A NEW LIFE ON THIS PLANET. THE BABY DESERVES HIS OR HER BEST CHANCE AT LIFE, AND WHAT YOU DO DURING PREGNANCY TO MANAGE YOUR STRESS IS IMPORTANT, IN THAT REGARD. HE TALKS ABOUT EATING RIGHT AND GETTING PROTEIN, CALCIUM, FOLIC ACID, FIBER. HE TALKS ABOUT BEING VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GOING ABOUT TRANQUILIZERS AND PAINKILLERS TO RELIVE ANXIETY. NEW STUDIES ARE COMING OUT ALL THE TIME ON THIS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NEW STUDIES ON THE USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS, THE USE OF TRANQUILIZERS DURING PREGNANCY, AND WERE STILL KIND OF FIGURING OUT WHAT ALL THIS DOES, ULTIMATELY IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE MOTHER TO KEEP HER EMOTIONS BALANCED BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO SEE WHAT OTHER EFFECTS THIS COULD HAVE DURING GESTATION. I THINK THE MAIN THING HE FOCUSES ON ALL OF THIS IS LOVE. TO TOUCH YOUR BABY EARLY ON, TO BREASTFEED IF YOU CAN, HE SAYS, "READ FRENCH OBSTETRICIAN FREDERIC LEBOYER, WHO POPULARIZED THE PRACTICE OF IMMERSING THE NEWBORN IN A WARM WATER BATH, WITHOUT DRUGS AND WITHOUT BRIGHT LIGHTS. LEBOYER RECOMMENDS THAT THE BABY BE HELD RIGHT AWAY AND FOR A LONG TIME. HE ADVISES AGAINST CUTTING THE UMBILICAL CORD TOO SOON AS THE CHILD'S ATTACHMENT WITH HIS MOTHER IS VITAL AT THE START OF LIFE." "THERE IS NO GREATER ADVICE I CAN GIVE THAN THIS: BE OPEN, EXPRESSIVE, AND FEELING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. A CARING MOTHER GIVES HER BABY THE BEST CHANCE FOR LONG-TERM WELL-BEING. YES, EVEN IF YOU DON'T EAT THOSE CARROTS AND TOMATOES WHEN YOU SHOULD, LOVE WILL HELP. YOUR CHILD IS PART OF YOU AND FEELS WHAT YOU FEEL, EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS IT. ALL I ASK IS AWARENESS. THE RESEARCH IS THERE; WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS ANYMORE." HE'S PUTTING IT OUT THERE, WE HAVE RESEARCH INTO THIS FIELD, WE CAN'T TURN A BLIND EYE TO IT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN.

442	THE CITYS MUNICIPAL CODE, UNION AGREEMENT, AND EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK, WHICH THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND CITY ATTORNEY ARE CREATING DRAFTS OF TO INCLUDE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY UNDER PROTECTED CLASSES. PHOTO BY ANNA ROSE MACARTHUR / KYUK. BETHEL CITY EMPLOYEES COULD SOON BE PROTECTED FROM SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY DISCRIMINATION. IN ITS REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETING ON TUESDAY, BETHEL CITY COUNCIL VOTED TO DRAFT LANGUAGE TO INCLUDE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY UNDER THE CITYS PROTECTED CLASSES. IF THE CHANGES TAKE EFFECT, IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR A CITY EMPLOYEE OR SOMEONE APPLYING FOR A JOB WITH THE CITY TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY BY ANOTHER CITY EMPLOYEE BECAUSE OF THEIR ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY. BETHEL COUNCIL MEMBER CHUCK HERMAN SUGGESTED THE CHANGES AFTER REVIEWING A DRAFT OF THE CITY EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK AND FINDING THE PROTECTED CLASSES LACKING. HE SAYS THE CHANGES WOULD MAKE THE CITY A MORE ATTRACTIVE EMPLOYER AND WOULD ALSO SEND A MESSAGE TO CITY WORKERS. WE ARE SIGNALING TO OUR FUTURE EMPLOYEES AND OUR CURRENT EMPLOYEES, HERMAN SAID, THAT WE DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THAT BASIS, AND WHAT WE CARE ABOUT IS RESULTS AND HARD WORK, AND BEING A COMPETENT AND CARING EMPLOYEE. THE BETHEL CITY ADMINISTRATOR AND CITY ATTORNEY ARE DRAFTING CONSISTENT LANGUAGE FOR THE CITYS MUNICIPAL CODE, UNION AGREEMENT, AND EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK, MAKING SURE ALL THREE DOCUMENTS PROTECTED CLASSES MATCH. THE CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PRESENTED TO THE COUNCIL IN LATE NOVEMBER. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TAKEN SIMILAR ACTIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE. THE ANCHORAGE ASSEMBLY IS AMENDING AN ORDINANCE THAT WOULD OUTLAW SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER EXPRESSION DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE, PUBLIC FACILITIES, AND IN HOUSING. LIKEWISE, IN JUNEAU, ASSEMBLYMAN JESSE KIEHL IS DRAFTING A CITY ORDINANCE THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THE SAME CLASSDISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE, PUBLIC FACILITIES, AND IN HOUSING. THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN BETHEL WOULD APPLY ONLY TO CITY EMPLOYEES, AND WOULD NOT EXTEND TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. TAGGED AS: ANTI-DISCRIMINATION , BETHEL CITY COUNCIL , CHUCK HERMAN , GENDER IDENTITY , JESSE KIEHL , SEXUAL ORIENTATION
443	GOOD MORNING TRADERS, AS OF THIS WRITING 4:10 AM EST, HERES WHAT WE SEE: US DOLLAR: DOWN AT 96.240 THE US DOLLAR IS DOWN 183 TICKS AND TRADING AT 16.240. ENERGIES: OCTOBER CRUDE IS DOWN AT 46.20. FINANCIALS: THE SEPT 30 YEAR BOND IS UP 22 TICKS AND TRADING AT 556.21. INDICES: THE SEPT S&P 500 EMINI ES CONTRACT IS DOWN 44 TICKS AND TRADING AT 1935.00. GOLD: THE OCTOBER GOLD CONTRACT IS TRADING DOWN AT 1123.80. GOLD IS 2 TICKS LOWER THAN ITS CLOSE. INITIAL CONCLUSION THIS IS NOT A CORRELATED MARKET. THE DOLLAR IS DOWN- AND OIL IS DOWN- WHICH IS NOT NORMAL AND THE 30 YEAR BOND IS TRADING HIGHER. THE FINANCIALS SHOULD ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH THE US DOLLAR SUCH THAT IF THE DOLLAR IS LOWER THEN BONDS SHOULD FOLLOW AND VICE-VERSA.  FOUNDED IN 2013 BY MAURICE BUCKLEY AND LORRAINE SCROOPE WITH OFFICES IN CORK AND LONDON AND SUPPORTED BY ENTERPRISE IRELAND, THE HIRE LAB IS NOW POWERING SOME OF THE LARGEST RECRUITMENT DRIVES ACROSS IRELAND AND THE THE INDICES ARE DOWN AND CRUDE IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED. GOLD IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED WITH THE US DOLLAR TRADING UP. I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT GOLD HAS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US DOLLAR AS WHEN THE US DOLLAR IS DOWN, GOLD TENDS TO RISE IN VALUE AND VICE-VERSA. THINK OF IT AS  SEESAW, WHEN ONE IS UP THE OTHER SHOULD BE DOWN. I POINT THIS OUT TO YOU TO MAKE YOU AWARE THAT WHEN WE DONT HAVE A CORRELATED MARKET, IT MEANS SOMETHING IS WRONG. AS TRADERS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS AND PROCEED WITH YOUR EYES WIDE OPN. ALL OF ASIA TRADED LOWER. PLEASE NOTE THE CHINA EXCHANGES ARE CLOSED FOR A BANK HOLIDAY.  THE COMPLETE SERIES BY ICHIRO AKUTO WAS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO COLLECT, WITH THE PROBABILITY THAT THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF FULL SETS IN EXISTENCE. AS OF THIS WRITING ALL OF EUROPE IS TRADING LOWER. POSSIBLE CHALLENGES TO TRADERS TODAY - FOMC MEMBER LACKER SPEAKS AT 8:10 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS M/M IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - NON-FARM EMPLOYMENT CHANGE IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS OUT AT 0:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. CURRENCIES YESTERDAY THE SWISS FRANC MADE ITS MOVE AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AFTER THE UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS NUMBERS CAME OUT. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND THAT TIME AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHARTS BELOW THE USD GAVE A SIGNAL AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST, WHILE THE SWISS FRANC ALSO GAVE A SIGNAL AT JUST ABOUT THE SAME TIME. LOOK ATTHE CHARTS BELOW AND YOULL SEE A PATTERN FOR ASSETS.  THIS TIME TO GET A MOBILE PHONE CASE IS FITTING REALLY. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH. THESE CHARTS REPRESENT THE VERSION OF TREND FOLLOWING TRADES AND IVE CHANGED THE TIMEFRAME TO A RENKO CHART TO DISPLAY BETTER. THIS REPRESENTED A SHORTING OPPORTUNITY ON THE SWISS FRANC, AS A TRADER YOU COULD HAVE NETTED 20 PLUS TICKS ON THIS TRADE. WE ADDED A DONCHIAN CHANNEL TO THE CHARTS TO SHOW THE SIGNALS MORE CLEARLY. REMEMBER EACH TICK ON THE SWISS FRANC IS EQUAL TO $12.50 VERSUS $10.40 THAT WE USUALLY SEE FOR CURRENCIES. CHARTS COURTESY OF TREND FOLLOWING TRADES BUILT ON A NINJA TRADER PLATFORM BIAS YESTERDAY WE SAID OUR BIAS WAS NEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER. THE MARKETS MEANDERED INTO AND OUT OF POSITIVE TERRITORY ALL SESSION LONG BUT THE DOW CLOSED HIGHER BY 24 PONTS HOWEVER THE NASDAQ DROPPED BY 17, THE S&P CLIMBED BY 2. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS JOBS FRIDAY OUR BIAS IS NEUTRAL. COULD THIS CHANGE? OF COURSE. REMEMBER ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN A VOLATILE MARKET. COMMENTARY YESTERDAY WE SAID OUR BIAS NEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS (USD AND BONDS) WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER AND USUALLY THATS NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR AN UPSIDE DAY. WHAT WE DIDNT SEE WAS FOLLOW THRU ON THE PART OF THE INDICES HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS JOBS FRIDAY WE WILL MAINTAIN A NEUTRAL BIAS AS WE ALWAYS DO FOR JOBS FRIDAY. WHY? BECAUSE THE MARKETS HAVE NEVER SHOWN ANY SENSE OF NORMALCY ON JOBS FRIDAY OR FOMC DAY HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DOMINION, VISIT THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE AT WWW.DOM.COM .  "I WANTED FOR THEM TO KNOW THEY CAN ALWAYS FIND IT WITHIN THEMSELVES TO STAND UP," HE SAID. YESTERDAYS UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS CAME IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED AT 282,000 VERSUS 273,070 EXPECTED. TIME WILL TELL IF THIS HAS ANY EFFECT ON NON-FARM PAYROLLS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE ITS A GIVEN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WE WORK HARD FOR WHATEVER WE HAVE; WE SHOULD TAKE TIME TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOR. !!!!

445	THE LAWRENCE UNIVERSITY VOLLEYBALL TEAM, PLAGUED BY INJURIES AND NONSTOP GRUELING COMPETITION, AIMS TO GET OFF A NINE-GAME LOSING STREAK AS CONFERENCE PLAY BEGINS THIS WEEK. A SERIES OF HIGH-CALIBER TOURNAMENTS KEPT THE LADY VIKES ON THEIR TOES FOR THE ENTIRE MONTH OF SEPT., BUT IT IS TIME TO BEGIN THE REGULAR SEASON WITH STEADY FOCUS. PRE-SEASON IS ALWAYS REALLY DIFFICULT. WE HAVE PLAYED TEAMS THAT ARE RANKED AMONGST THE TOP 25 IN THE NATION, EXPLAINED SOPHOMORE COLLEEN NOWLAN, NAMING TEAMS SUCH AS ELMHURST, WHITEWATER AND EDGEWOOD. IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING, BUT WE GO BACK TO BASICS AND THE BASIC DRIVE TO WIN. A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS JUST TO CREATE THE INTENSITY ON THE COURT TO CARRY US THROUGH THE REGULAR SEASON. ON SEPT. 1, LAWRENCE TRAVELED TO MILWAUKEE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING (MSOE) TO TAKE ON THE RAIDERS AS WELL AS WISCONSIN LUTHERAN COLLEGE IN A TOUGH DOUBLE DUAL RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THE VIKINGS FELL TO BOTH OPPONENTS AS THEY WERE STILL RECOVERING FROM PRE-SEASON CAMPS DEMANDING TRAINING PROGRAM. AT TIMES, THAT PROGRAM LED TO ACHES AND PAINS AS WELL AS MORE SERIOUS INJURIES ON THE TEAM. I SPRAINED MY ANKLE DURING CAMP WEEK. I WAS OUT FOR A WHILE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE FRACTURED IT, SAID NOWLAN. SOME FRESHMEN CAME IN WITH INJURIES FROM THE PAST, AND WITH MULTIPLE TWICE-A-DAYS AND THE INTENSE PRACTICES, THEY KIND OF WORSENED. THAT ESCALATED TO PEOPLE SITTING OUT. FOR OUR SENIORS I THINK IT IS JUST WEAR AND TEAR ON THEIR BODIES. WE DO A LOT OF HARD WORKOUTS. WE LIFT, PRACTICE TWICE A DAY AND RUN A LOT. IT JUST ADDED UP, AND A LOT OF US WERE NOT EXPECTING THAT. IT KNOCKED US ALL OUT. JUST DAYS AFTER THE MSOE DOUBLE DUAL, LU TRAVELED TO ELMHURST COLLEGE IN ILLINOIS FOR A TWO-DAY INVITATIONAL. IN ATTENDANCE WERE ST. MARYS COLLEGE OF INDIANA, NORTH PARK UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AND FONTBONNE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI, ALONG WITH THE HOST TEAM. THIS TOURNAMENT OFFERED A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY CHALLENGING, OUT-OF-STATE TEAMS THAT THE VIKINGS DO NOT NORMALLY SEE. LAWRENCE RETURNED TO APPLETON AT THE END OF THE WEEKEND WITH A 3-1 RECORD, DEFEATING FONTBONNE 3-1 IN THE FINAL GAME OF THE INVITATIONAL. THE VOLLEYBALL TEAMS HOME OPENER AGAINST MARIAN COLLEGE ON SEPT. 9 WAS HARD-FOUGHT AND EXCITING TO WATCH, BUT THE VIKINGS FELL 3-1, THE SCORE OF THE FINAL SET A CLOSE 25-23. FOLLOWING THEIR FIRST HOME GAME, THE LADY VIKES PRE-SEASON WAS MADE UP OF MORE COMPETITION AGAINST MANY ELITE OPPONENTS SUCH AS ST. OLAF, UW-STEVENS POINT AND EDGEWOOD COLLEGE. DURING THOSE PRE-SEASON GAMES WE DID A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL WORK FOR THOSE THAT WERE IN, SAYS NOWLAN. HITTING, GETTING THE FOOTWORK DOWN TO MAYBE PREVENT SOME INJURIES. BY FRIDAY, JUST ABOUT EVERYONE WAS BACK. OUR COACH HAS LESSENED SOME OF IT. WE DO NOT DO STAIRS ANYMORE. IN GAMES, HE WILL THROW SOMEONE ELSE IN TO GIVE SOMEONE A BREAK. WE ARE GOING INTO CONFERENCE COMPETITION NOW SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR LINEUP IS STEADY. THAT LINEUP INCLUDES A NOTABLY YOUNG AND TALENTED TEAM. VIKING VOLLEYBALL HAS NO JUNIORS THIS YEAR AND ONLY TWO SENIORS. UNFORTUNATELY THAT SENIOR LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN LIMITED ON THE COURT DUE TO INJURIES. SENIOR TERESE SWORDS HAS BEEN DEALING WITH A SHOULDER INJURY, BUT THE TEAM IS OPTIMISTIC THAT SHE WILL RECOVER QUICKLY ENOUGH TO PLAY THE SECOND HALF OF THE SEASON. THE OTHER SENIOR, MEGAN CONLEY, IS CURRENTLY WAITING TO HEAR DETAILS ON A HIP INJURY WHICH COULD BE LONG-TERM OR COULD HAVE A QUICK TURNOVER AND HAVE HER BACK ON THE COURT PLAYING AS NEEDED. FRESHMAN NICOLE WITMER, WHO HAS BEEN DOING REHAB FOR AN ACHILLES INJURY, RETURNED TO PRACTICE JUST IN TIME FOR THE REGULAR SEASON. OUR YOUNG TEAM IS GOING REALLY WELL, FIGURING OUT TEAM CHEMISTRY, REVEALED NOWLAN. OFF THE COURT, WERE REALLY CLOSE. WERE ALL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER AND JOKE AROUND A LOT. WERE ALL SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER ON THE COURT. THERES REALLY NOT A LOT OF UNDERLYING COMPETITION. WE WANT EVERYONE TO SUCCEED. ON WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 23, THE VIKINGS HOSTED CARROLL UNIVERSITY, WHOSE 3-10 RECORD GOING INTO CONFERENCE COMPETITION WAS WITHIN REACH OF LAWRENCES TOUGH 1-14 RECORD. THE PIONEERS PLAYED SOME COMPARABLE PRE-SEASON GAMES, LOSING TO SIMILAR TEAMS LIKE WISCONSIN LUTHERAN, MSOE, UW-OSHKOSH AND ELMHURST, ALONG WITH SOME OTHER CHALLENGING OPPONENTS SUCH AS UW-EAU CLAIRE, UW-PLATTEVILLE AND CARTHAGE COLLEGE. TWO MORE HOME GAMES WILL GIVE LAWRENCE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN SOME MOMENTUM FOR THE CONFERENCE SEASON. ON FRIDAY, SEPT. 25, GRINNELL COLLEGE WILL CHALLENGE THE VIKINGS AT ALEXANDER GYMNASIUM, AND SATURDAY, SEPT. 26, IS FAMILY DAY, WHEN CORNELL COLLEGE COMES TO APPLETON TO TAKE ON THE LADY VIKES.

447	12:52 A.M. CDT BY JANE WARDELL SYDNEY (REUTERS) - THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS UNDER FIRE FOR LOBBYING THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO STOP A BAN ON THE SALE OF KANGAROO PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. STATE, A RESTRICTION THE INDUSTRY ARGUES WOULD CRIPPLE EXPORTS OF THE MARSUPIALS' MEAT AND LEATHER. THE CALIFORNIA SENATE WILL VOTE ON THURSDAY ON A BILL TO EXTEND A MORATORIUM INDEFINITELY ON THE SALE OF KANGAROO PRODUCTS LIKE PREMIER LEAGUE BASEBALL MITTS AND FIRE RETARDANT GLOVES FAVORED BY U.S. FIREFIGHTERS. POWERFUL ANIMAL RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY LOBBYISTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ANGRY ABOUT THE WAY THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED THIS WEEK VIA THE BACKDOOR, JUST DAYS BEFORE THE END OF THE CURRENT LEGISLATIVE SESSION, FOLLOWING EXTENSIVE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT LOBBYING AND FINANCIAL AID. THE A$200 MILLION ($140 MILLION) TRADE OF KANGAROO SKIN AND MEAT IS AN EMOTIVE ISSUE. THE AUSTRALIAN NATIVE GRACES THE COUNTRY'S COAT OF ARMS AND IS A MAJOR TOURISM DRAW, MAKING IT A HIGH PROFILE TARGET FOR ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WHO OPPOSE COMMERCIAL KILLING. HOWEVER, WITH A KANGAROO POPULATION OF ABOUT 48 MILLION, MORE THAN DOUBLE THE HUMAN POPULATION, THE ANIMAL IS ALSO CONSIDERED A PEST IN MANY AREAS BECAUSE OF THE THREAT IT POSES TO AGRICULTURE, CATTLE AND ENDANGERED ANIMALS. CALIFORNIA - THE WORLD'S LARGEST MARKET FOR UPMARKET LEATHER GOODS - FORMALLY BANNED THE IMPORT AND SALE OF KANGAROO PRODUCTS IN 1971, BUT THE MARKET HAS FLOURISHED UNDER AN EIGHT-YEAR MORATORIUM. SKINS ARE POPULAR WITH SPORTSWEAR MANUFACTURERS INCLUDING ADIDAS AG AND NIKE INC. THE MORATORIUM IS DUE TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. DEMOCRAT LAWMAKER MIKE GIPSON THIS WEEK USED A TACTIC KNOWN AS A "GUT AND AMEND" TO SWITCH A BILL ON GAMBLING THAT HAD ALREADY REACHED THE SENATE FLOOR TO ONE THAT PROPOSES THE EXTENSION OF THE MORATORIUM, THIS TIME WITH NO SUNSET CLAUSE. THE BILL MUST BE APPROVED BY TWO-THIRDS OF THE SENATE IN A VOTE SCHEDULED FOR THURSDAY BEFORE GOING TO COMMITTEE. 'SECRECY' THE MANEUVER IS LEGAL BUT FROWNED UPON BY MANY DEMOCRACY ADVOCATES AS IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR OPEN AND EXTENSIVE DEBATE ON AN ISSUE. "IT SMACKS OF SPECIAL INTEREST DEALING AND SECRECY," SAID U.S. HUMANE SOCIETY SPOKESWOMAN JENNIFER FEARING FROM THE CALIFORNIA CAPITOL BUILDING, WHERE SHE WAS PRESSING LAWMAKERS TO VOTE AGAINST THE BILL. "IF THEY ARE SO CONFIDENT THAT KANGAROOS ARE ABUNDANT AND THERE'S NO PROBLEM AND CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONTINUE TO SELL PRODUCTS, WHY SO MUCH SECRECY?" ANOTHER LOBBYIST, LAUREN ORNELAS OF THE FOOD EMPOWERMENT PROJECT, HAS FILED A COMPLAINT TO THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION, ALLEGING AUSTRALIA MAY HAVE ACTED ILLEGALLY BECAUSE IT DID NOT DECLARE FINANCIAL PAYMENTS OR REGISTER AS A LOBBYIST EMPLOYER. AUSTRALIA'S DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE CONFIRMED IT PROVIDED A$143,000 TO THE KANGAROO INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA TO HELP PAY U.S. LAW FIRM MANATT, PHELPS AND PHILLIPS TO LOBBY CALIFORNIAN LAWMAKERS AGAINST THE BAN. A SPOKESMAN FOR AGRICULTURE MINISTER BARNABY JOYCE DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER, BUT STRESSED THAT COMMERCIAL HARVESTS OF KANGAROOS, GENERALLY ABOUT 15-20 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION, WERE BOTH SUSTAINABLE AND HUMANE. A GROUP OF 74 AUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTS AND ACTIVISTS HAS ISSUED AN OPEN LETTER QUESTIONING THE DATA. THE INDUSTRY IS CAUTIOUSLY HOPEFUL THE CALIFORNIAN LOBBYING WILL PAY OFF. ADIDAS AND NIKE DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT. (REPORTING BY JANE WARDELL; EDITING BY ROBERT BIRSEL)
448	IT IS TRADITIONAL IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A BRIEF RAINSTORM IN EARLY FALL, AROUND THE END OF AUGUST OR BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER, FOLLOWED BY ABOUT 6-8 WEEKS OF HEAT. WE CALL THIS INDIAN SUMMER. THAT IS ITS NAME. IT IS NOT NATIVE AMERICAN SUMMER. THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE GETS YOU SHANKED AND LIT ON FIRE. THE SUN COMES UP LATER AND THE SHADE, WITH THE BREEZE RUNNING THROUGH IT, IS WARM BUT NOT UNPLEASANT, HOWEVER THE SUN IS SCORCHING HOT. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE IN HEAT AND SHADE MAKES THE WEATHER VERY SCHIZOPHRENIC, AND THE BREEZES PICK UP DURING THIS TIME TO GET STRONGER AND COLDER AND SHARPER OFF THE PACIFIC. YOU START TO NOTICE THEM MORE, EVEN AS THE SUN BURNS. YOU CAN TAKE MID-DAY WALKS IN THIS, IF YOU STICK TO THE SHADE. I MOSTLY WALK IN THE EARLY MORNING, BEFORE THE SUN COMES UP, BECAUSE AS SOON AS THE SUN HITS YOU, EVEN AT 7 AM, IT BURNS WITH HEAT. YOU REALLY FEEL IT. WE ALSO GET WINDS FROM BOTH DIRECTIONS. RIGHT NOW THERE IS DOWNSLOPE WIND OUT OF NEVADA, OVER THE TOP OF THE SIERRAS. THIS SUMMER THERE'S BEEN MORE RAIN IN NEVADA THAN IN CALIFORNIA, MOSTLY DUE TO HURRICANES SHATTERING OFF THE MEXICAN COAST AND THEIR MOISTURE SURGING INTO THE MOHAVE DESERT AND THROUGH VEGAS AND NORTH TO IDAHO, OR SOMETIMES OVER THE PEAKS OF THE SIERRA TO RAIN UP THERE. BUT NOT DOWN HERE. DOWN HERE WE GET HEATED AIR. WARM WINDS. THE NORTH COAST, FROM AROUND FORT BRAGG NORTH TO CANADA HAS BEEN GETTING RAINS ALL THIS TIME, AND MOST OF THE WEATHER THAT HEADS FOR CALIFORNIA FROM HAWAII MERELY MAKES CLOUDS HERE ACTUALLY RAINS UP THERE TO MY NORTHWEST. THE NORTH COAST, AS IT IS CALLED, IS VERY WEIRD. ITS MOSTLY COMMERCIAL FISHING, UNTIL THE CALIFORNIA AQUADUCT KILLED OFF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER DELTA SALMON IN 1980 (BY GOV. BROWN!). CALIFORNIA USED TO EAT A LOT OF SALMON BEFORE THEN. THERE WAS PLENTY TO GO AROUND. BUT WHEN BROWN TURNED ON THE PUMPS IT CUISINARTED ALL THE BABY SALMON, KILLING THEM ENTIRELY. THERE WERE NO NEW FISH TO GROW AND HARVEST. ALL THE FISHERMEN LOST THEIR BOATS. THAT BANKRUPTED ALL THE NORTH COAST AND CENTRAL COAST FISHERMEN RELIANT ON THEM, COLLAPSING BOTH AREAS INTO HORRIBLE BANKRUPTCY AND DIVORCES AND CRIME. THE NORTH COAST TURNED TO LOGGING, WHICH ONLY EMPLOYED SOME OF THEM. REDWOOD DECKS WERE POPULAR WITH LIBERALS IN BERKELEY, WHO HYPOCRITICALLY BUILD THEIR OWN DECKS, THEN JOINED THE ANTI-LOGGING MOVEMENT AND ACTUALLY STARTED MURDERING LOGGERS (SPIKING TREES SHATTERS SAWS OPERATED BY LOGGERS) WHO CUT THE TREES THAT BUILT THEIR DECKS. THIS REALLY HAPPENED. THE MOVEMENT DIED BY JUDI BARI BLEW HERSELF UP WITH A BOMB IN HER CAR IN SAN FRANCISCO, BETWEEN HATE RALLIES WHERE SHE WAS BRAGGING THAT IT WAS JUSTIFIED TO MURDER LOGGERS. I SAW VIDEO OF HER SAYING THIS ON MY LOCAL NEWS, WHICH HER FOLLOWERS DENIED, BUT IT WAS ON VIDEO. IT WAS ON MY NEWS. I SAW HER LIPS MOVE. SHE REALLY DID SAY IT. HER DEATH ENDED THE KILLINGS. GOOD RIDDANCE. UNFORTUNATELY, AT THIS POINT THE FISHERMEN HAD LOST THEIR BOATS TO BANKRUPTCY, AND THEIR HOMES TO THE LOGGING JOBS BEING SHUT DOWN BY HYPOCRITES AND MURDERERS FROM BERKELEY WHO RETURNED SOUTH TO A WELL EARNED IPA ON A LOVELY REDWOOD DECK, CONTENT IN THEIR HYPOCRISY. AND THAT'S WHY I HATE HIPPIES. THEY ARE MURDERERS. THE NORTH COAST IS HEAVILY FAULTED, BEING A LOCATION WHERE THE JUAN DE FUCA AND PACIFIC PLATES MEET WITH THE NORTH AMERICAN PLATE AND MAKE COMPLICATED GEOLOGY, AND SEISMOLOGY. THE VOLCANOES START NORTH OF THAT POINT TOO. THE ONES SOUTH OF THERE ARE DYING OUT BECAUSE THE PACIFIC PLATE IS UNDERNEATH US AND HAS CUT OFF THE LAVA SOURCE. UNLESS THERE'S BREAKAGE OF THE PLATE EDGE, WHICH HAPPENS, AND WOULD CAUSE HUGE SURGES OF VOLCANISM IN WEAK SPOTS, AS WELL AS NEW VOLCANOES ALL OVER THE PLACE. WHEN A SUBDUCTING PLATE (EDGE) BREAKS ALL BETS ARE OFF. THAT WOULD BE WORTH STUDYING, PROVIDED YOU MOVED FAST ENOUGH NOT TO GET STUCK IN THE WAY OF ALL THE ERUPTIONS. *GEOLOGISTS GLEAM* ANYWAY, THIS HEAT HAS HAD ME PONDERING SMALL SAILBOAT SAILING ON LAKES. MOST OF THEM ARE MISSING HALF THEIR WATER SO THIS IS NOT A GOOD SUMMER FOR THAT. I AM WAITING FOR THE RAINS TO REFILL THEM, THEN I PLAN TO JOIN THE YACHT CLUB, SAIL THEIR BOATS AND SEE IF I REALLY LIKE IT OR NOT. IT WILL BE MY ADDITIONAL PRACTICE TIME. SAILING IS A SPECIAL KIND OF FUN BECAUSE IT IS EXERCISE, BUT ALSO REQUIRES YOUR BRAIN, LIKE DRIVING A CAR. YOU NEED TO DEVELOP SPECIAL SKILLS TO LISTEN TO THE WIND, TO FEEL ITS DIRECTION AND USE ITS STRENGTH. THIS IS TRICKY IN THE MOUNTAINS BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF SURGES AND GUSTS RATHER THAN STEADY BLOWING, THOUGH YOU SOMETIMES GET THAT TOO, JUST TO BE DIFFICULT. I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT DAY SAILERS AND CABIN CRUISERS, WHICH ARE POPULAR BOATS ON THE CALIFORNIA COAST. SAN FRANCISCO BAY, IS HUGE, LOTS OF PLACES TO SAIL IN RELATIVE SAFETY, THOUGH THE GALES MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING, AND THE WATER IS BOTH COLD AND POLLUTED. THE PACIFIC OCEAN IS CLEANER, THOUGH IT HAS A COUPLE ODD POINTS. FOR ONE, SHARKS BIGGER THAN THE MOVIE GREAT WHITE FROM JAWS ACTUALLY EXIST. THEY EAT SEA LIONS, WHICH ARE BIGGER AND MEANER THAN SEALS. THEY SOMETIMES BITE PEOPLE. SO DO THE SHARKS. WHEN A PERSON GETS BIT BY A SHARK ON MY COAST, THEY USUALLY DIE SCREAMING. ONLY RARELY DO THEY LIVE. THE SHARKS HERE ARE BIG. 25 FEET IS NOT UNUSUAL. JAWS WAS 18 FEET LONG IN THE MOVIE. THEY CAN EAT A SEA LION WHOLE IN THREE CHOMPS. AND SEA LIONS ARE ABOUT 350 POUNDS. SO THAT'S ONE PARTICULAR THING ABOUT THE COAST. ANOTHER IS THE WATER IS VERY COLD, AROUND 54'F. THAT'S HYPOTHERMIA IN AROUND 20 MINUTES, POSSIBLY LESS. IF YOU GO INTO THE WATER, YOU STOP MOVING IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND DIE IN AROUND 20. OR THE SHARKS GET YOU BECAUSE THEY ARE ATTRACTED TO BLOOD AND LOW VOLTAGE ELECTRICITY FROM METALS IN SALT WATER. ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE COASTAL WATERS IS THERE'S A NORTH WIND, WHICH MAKES THE WATER THIS COLD AND BLOWS THE FOG INLAND. SO GOING NORTH YOU HAVE TO TACK A LOT. AND GOING SOUTH YOU CAN GO VERY FAST. BUT THE OCEAN SWELLS ALSO GROW VERY LARGE SO THE BEACHES ARE SMALL, IF THE EXIST AT ALL, AND WASH AWAY WITHOUT A SOURCE OF SAND, WHICH IS WHY BIG SUR IS ALL CLIFFS AND NO BEACHES. SAME AS SOUTH OF FRANCE. THEY DON'T HAVE BEACHES EITHER. CLAIMING TO SIT ON A BEACH IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE IS PROOF YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE. COLD WATER IS FULL OF NUTRIENTS. ESPECIALLY DISSOLVED GASES. SO COLD WATER GROWS GREAT FISH. THIS IS WHY THERE ARE SEA LIONS AND SHARKS. THE NORTH WIND DRAGS COLD WATER TO THE SURFACE AND PHYSICALLY ENRICHES THE WATER, AND THAT WIND CAN ALSO, POST OIL, PROVIDE THE ENERGY TO POWER SAILING SHIPS WITH FISHING NETS. AND RATHER THAN SPEND ENERGY HAULING LOTS OF SAILORS, AND THEIR LIVING QUARTERS, YOU CAN SPEND LESS ENERGY RUNNING ELECTRIC WINCHES AND BATTERIES. THIS LETS YOU HAVE A SMALLER BOAT, OR ONE THAT CARRIES MORE FISH. PRIOR TO STEAM POWERED BOATS, FISHING WAS DONE WITH SMALL BOATS AND NETS AND MEN. LONG JOURNEYS TO CATCH FISH GO BACK OVER 1000 YEARS. COD, FOR INSTANCE, WAS POPULARIZED DUE TO THE DISCOVERY THAT ICELAND HAS SHOALS TO ITS SOUTHEAST FULL OF COD, WHICH FISHERMEN PULLED OUT, CLEANED, AND DOUSED IN SALT IN BARRELS, WHICH THEY THEN SOLD DOWN IN LONDON AS GENERAL PROTEIN. THEY DID THIS, AND KEPT RECORDS OF HOW MANY WERE CAUGHT AND SOLD, SINCE AROUND 800 AD. AND THIS WAS ALL DONE WITH SAILS. THAT IS QUITE AMAZING. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT IS A WAY FORWARD POST OIL. WHEN WE'RE EXPORTING FUEL FOR MONEY, AND SAVING THE REST SO OUR MILITARY CAN PROTECT US FROM INVADERS AND PIRATES AND SAVING LIVES (FIRE FIGHTING, AIR AMBULANCE). RICH PEOPLE WON'T PAVE THE ROADS. THEY'LL LIVE NEAR AIRPORTS AND JUST FLY TO THEIR VACATION SITES. THIS IS SENSIBLE IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY. HIRE VETERANS TO RUN YOUR AIRPORT AND PROTECT IT. SAME WITH THE RANCHES AND CLOSED TOWNS YOU VISIT AT YOUR DESTINATION. RICH VILLAGES FOR MULTIMILLIONAIRES, SURROUNDED BY SKI SLOPES IN THE WINTER, AND MOUNTAIN BIKING IN THE SUMMER, 10 MILES FROM LAKE TAHOE, A FINE AND SAFE PLACE FOR BOATING IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY. IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY. I THINK FEUDALISM IS COMING TO AMERICA. INHERITANCE LAWS SUPPORT IT ALREADY, AND SOME FAMILIES TRAIN MONEY MAKING A LOT MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN OTHERS. YOU GET CONCENTRATED WEALTH, AND EROSION OF FEDERAL LAW THROUGH DELIBERATE ABUSE BY THE LAST TWO PRESIDENTS MEANS THAT LOCAL RULE, AND LOCAL MONEY, CHANGES THE RULES IN THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS. SO WE'LL SEE MORE OF THESE, AND MORE MANSIONS WITH POINT FENCES, AND VETERANS WITH RIFLES GUARDING THEM. VETERANS DON'T HESITATE TO SHOOT. THEY KNOW BETTER. PICTURE THAT. THAT'S OUR FUTURE. WE'LL BE IN THIS KIND OF THING IN ABOUT 20 YEARS.

452	WHAT IS ACNEH PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERING OPINIONS AS FROM WHAT ACNE REALLY IS. MANY ACNE NATUAL SKIN CARE TREATMENTS CAN REDUCE ACNE INFLAMMATION HOWEVER THEY DO NOT REMOVE ACNE PIT SCARS. MANY ACNE SKIN CARE TREATMENTS CAN HELP TO ELIMINATE ACNE INFLAMMATION NEVERTHELESS THEY DO NOT REMOVE ACNE PIT SCARS. IT'S'S BETTER TO USE A GENTLE CLEANSING AGENT. THIS MEANS THAT WHENEVER ONE TAKES A LOT OF BIOTIN, THERE EXISTS A GREAT CHANCE THAT ONE'SB5 VITAMIN LEVEL COULD BE LOWER THAN NORMAL. IT CAN ALSO STAY ON OVERNIGHT. WHAT IS THE BEST FACE WASH FOR CYSTIC ACNEH - DEEP ACNE CYST TREATMENTS THAT WORK. I READ SOMEWHERE THAT ADULT ACNE WHICH WAS PERSISTENT WAS USUALLY CAUSED BY A HORMONAL IMBALANCE OR EVEN TO FUNGUS INFECTION INSIDE THE GUT CALLED CANDIDA. I REALLY HOPE THIS ARTICLE HAS HELPED YOU TOGETHER WITH POINTED YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TAKING VITAMINB7 (BIOTIN) PILLS MIGHT NOT INFLUENCE THE SKIN AT ALL, IT REALLY DEPENDS ON ONE'S BODY. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR CHIN TOGETHER WITH YOUR HANDS FREQUENTLY, REMOVE THIS HABIT. ORGANIC MEATS AND TOFU. BAKING SODA. APPLE CIDER VINEGAR. ALLOW THIS MIXTURE TO DRY AND RINSE. A LARGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ASSUME, THAT TAKING LARGE DOSES OF DRUGS OR VITAMINS CAN GET THEM BETTER MORE QUICKLY. WHAT IS THE BEST FACE WASH FOR CYSTIC ACNEH - DEEP ACNE CYST TREATMENTS THAT WORK. FRESH VEGETABLES AND FRUIT CONTAIN HARDLY ANY SATURATED FATS AND THEREFORE ARE PACKED WITH VITAMINS, MINERALS, AND FIBERS. WASHING WITH SULFUR HELPS ELIMINATE ACNE BY PEELING OF THE SKIN. VITAMIN C IS FOUND IN MANY VEGETABLES AND FRUITS SUCH AS KALE, BROCCOLI, TOMATOES, LEMON, ORANGES, PEACHES, ETC. SO, HOPEFULLY YOU MAY HAVE LEARNT A BIT ABOUT WHAT A GREAT ACNE TREATMENT SUDOCREM IS THAT SUDOCREM AND DOES WORK ON ACNE! SKIN ROUTINE USING SUDOCREM.

(PHOTO: WLTX) COLUMBIA, SC (WLTX)-DECKER INTERNATIONAL BOULEVARD IS KNOWN AS THE PLACE YOU CAN EAT AND SHOP IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES EVERY DAY ALONG ONE ROAD. NOW A LAW ENFORCEMENT COMPLEX WILL BE ADDED TO THE MIX. THE DECKER CENTER IS A PART OF THE MASTER PLAN.IT'LL HAVE SEVERAL COURTROOMS, THE SHERIFF'S REGION TWO OFFICE AND THE QUARTERMASTER THAT SUPPLIES THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WITH ALL THEIR EQUIPMENT. IT'LL EVEN HAVE A COMMUNITY ROOM FORNEIGHBORHOODGROUPS TO USE. THE BUILDING IS REPLACING A KROGER GROCERY STORE AND STRIP MALL ON DECKER BOULEVARD AND O'NEIL COURT. THIS IS EXPECTED TO BRING IN A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE TO THE AREA. SYLVIA HANNA IS THE PRESIDENT OF DECKER BOULEVARD BUSINESS COALITION SHE SAYS THIS WILL HAVE A PROFOUND ECONOMIC IMPACT. "WE ARE EXCITED FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE FOR THEFACT THAT HERE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WE GET A NEW BUILDING" SAID HANNA. "ITS GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT SETTING FOR DECKER BOULEVARD.

HE SAYS31 MILLION DOLLARS WAS ALLOCATED TO THE PROJECT. "WERE ON SCHEDULE, WERE UNDER BUDGET AND VERY PLEASED ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE THINGS" SAID MANNING. THE BUILDING WILL HOUSE THE MAGISTRATE COURT AND RICHLAND COUNTY SHERIFF DEPARTMENT REGION 2 HEADQUARTERS.

THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT ISSUE ALL THE SUPPLIES TO THE DEPUTIES SO ITS GOING TO CREATE A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF THAT BUILDING" SAID MANNING. THE PARKING LOT WILL BE SUITED FOR OUTDOOR EVENTS AND THERE WILL EVEN BE A COMMUNITY ROOM.

455	ARCHIVE. HOWEVER, WOLFSBURG COACH DIETER HECKING INSISTED ON TUESDAY HE ISNT WORRIED BY THE PROSPECT OF COMING TO OLD TRAFFORD AND TRYING TO SECURE A RESULT ALTHOUGH HE CONCEDED IT WILL NOT BE EASY. BUT WHO WILL COME OUT ON TOP? STAY TUNED TO STANDARD SPORT FOR ALL THE ACTION! PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT FOR THE LIVE BLOG TO LOAD WHAT THEY SAID VAN GAAL "I HAVE TO CONSIDER IF I WANT TO USE THESE PLAYERS," HETOLD MUTV.  "BUT WHEN SHE MEASURED MY STOMACH WITH A TAPE MEASURE," BETSY SAID, "I WAS THE SAME SIZE THAT MY STOMACH HAD BEEN THE APPOINTMENT PRIOR." AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION WAS IN ORDER. "WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PLAYERS BECAUSE WE ARE PLAYING THREE MATCHES EVERY WEEK. "IT'S THE ACCUMULATION OF TIREDNESS - WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT.  THE DEMONSTRATION ZONES THUS FAR APPROVED IN CHINA ARE EXPECTED TO PLAY AN EXEMPLARY ROLE FOR THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER HIGH-TECH ZONES AND REGIONS. I HAVE TO CONSIDER EVERY WEEK IF I CAN USE A PLAYER OR NOT. NOW HERRERA, CARRICK AND VALENCIA HAVE MINOR ISSUES.  THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSED THE TERRITORY PLAN CHANGE IN AN EFFORT TO MAXIMISE SALE PRICES FOR LAND FROM DEMOLISHED LOOSE FILL ASBESTOS HOMES, HELPING TO OFFSET THE COST OF BUYING AND DEMOLISHING MORE THAN 1000 CONTAMINATED HOMES. WE HAVE TO TAKE A DECISION AND I WILL TAKE THAT, MORE OR LESS, ON WEDNESDAY." MANCHESTER UNITED WELCOME THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE BACK TO OLD TRAFFORD ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN LOUIS VAN GAAL'S MEN HOST GERMAN CLUB WOLFSBURG IN THEIR GROUP B CLASH. THE GAME WILL BE THE CLUB'S FIRST HOME MATCH IN THE TOURNAMENT SINCE THEY LOST TO BAYERN MUNICH AT OLD TRAFFORD IN 2014, AND THE RED DEVILS WILL BE LOOKING FOR A WIN AFTER SUFFERING DEFEAT IN THEIR OPENING CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MATCH AWAY TO PSV EINDHOVEN. THAT GAME SAW UNITED SURRENDER A 1-0 LEAD BEFORE EVENTUALLY BEING BEATEN 2-1, BUT IT WILL PERHAPS BE MORE REMEMBERED FOR THE HORROR TACKLE THAT LEFT LUKE SHAW WITH A DOUBLE FRACTURE OF HIS LEG - AND OUT FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME. DESPITE BEING WITHOUT THE FULL-BACK FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, UNITED WILL BE IN A CONFIDENT MOOD AHEAD OF THEIR CLASH WITH WOLFSBURG AFTER GOING TOP OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE ON SUNDAY WITH A 3-0 WIN OVER SUNDERLAND. THEIR RECENT STRING OF VICTORIES HAS LED TO UNITED MIDFIELDER BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER ADMITTING THE CLUB HAVE THE STRENGTH TO WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE ALTHOUGH THEIR OPPOSITION ON WEDNESDAY WON'T BE EASY TO BEAT . WOLFSBURG SIT IN FOURTH PLACE IN THE BUNDESLIGA STANDINGS, BUT SUFFERED AN EMBARRASSING 5-1 THRASHING AT THE HANDS OF BAYERN MUNICH LAST WEEK, WHICH SAW ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI SCORE FIVE GOALS IN NINE SECOND-HALF MINUTES TO STUN THE VISITORS AT THE ALLIANZ ARENA.
456	ONTARIO DOCTORS WARN THAT PATIENTS WILL HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CUTTING THEIR FEES. THE GOVERNMENT IS CHOPPING FEES BY 1.3 PER CENT STARTING NEXT WEEK TO KEEP THE PROFESSION WITHIN AN ALLOTTED $11.6-BILLION BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. DR. MICHAEL TOTH, PRESIDENT OF THE ONTARIO MEDICAL ASSOCIATION , SAYS THE PROFESSION IS FRUSTRATED AND SOME MEMBERS ARE TALKING ABOUT LEAVING THE PROVINCE OR RETIRING EARLY. "IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PATIENTS ULTIMATELY," HE WARNED, NOTING THAT SOME PHYSICIANS WILL BE FORCED TO LAY OFF STAFF AND CUT OFFICE BUDGETS. PHYSICIANS ARE VENTING THEIR ANGER ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ON TWITTER , HARDLINERS ARE THREATENING JOB ACTION SUCH AS A WORK-TO-RULE CAMPAIGN, HOUR CUTBACKS AND CANCELLATION OF FLU-SHOT CLINICS.  HEALTH MINISTER ERIC HOSKINS SAID HE WANTS TO REASSURE ONTARIANS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERVICE CUTS. "MY CONCERN IS THAT A PERCEPTION IS BEING PROPAGATED THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE CHALLENGING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE FACTS SIMPLY DON'T BEAR THIS OUT," HE SAID.  FROM THAT, PHYSICIANS PAY OVERHEAD COSTS, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE WAGES AND OFFICE RENT, AN AMOUNT WIDELY QUOTED AS ABOUT 30 PER CENT.  STOKELY VALE REMAINED ROOTED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 15-TEAM STANDINGS AFTER A 4-1 SPANKING BY REAL MARACAS FC AT THE PLYMOUTH RECREATION GROUND. HOSKINS SAID PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED OVER WHAT IS A DISPUTE OVER REMUNERATION: "I HAVE RECEIVED ASSURANCE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE OMA THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE ACTION THAT WILL IMPACT THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY PROVIDE OR PATIENT SAFETY. I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD." THE RIFT DATES BACK TO A PAYMENT SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT UNILATERALLY IMPOSED LAST JANUARY AFTER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OMA ENDED IN AN IMPASSE.  GROOMING: LARRY KING FOR STREETERS. IT INCLUDED A 2.65 PER CENT FEE CUT AND A CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IF DOCTORS' OHIP BILLINGS WERE TAKING DOCTORS OVER THEIR $11.6-ALLOTMENT. THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENT MODEL ALLOWS DOCTORS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPENSATION. IF THEY SEE MORE PATIENTS AND PERFORM MORE PROCEDURES, THEY CAN BILL THE PUBLIC INSURANCE PLAN FOR MORE MONEY. THE PAYMENT SCHEME ALSO INCLUDES INCREASES OF 1.25 PER CENT IN THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES BUDGET FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  BUT THE OMA CONTENDS INCREASES OF 2.7 PER CENT ARE NEEDED IN EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND GROWTH. THE OMA IS LOBBYING MPPS, HOLDING TOWN HALL MEETINGS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE PROVINCE AND STAGING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH MEMBERS NEXT WEEK. TOTH ARGUED THERE IS A "POWER IMBALANCE" WITH GOVERNMENT AND CALLED FOR A NEUTRAL THIRD-PARTY TO WEIGH IN WITH A BINDING DECISION: "WE ARE LOOKING TO RESOLVE THIS ... WE THINK THE WAY TO DO THIS IS MEDIATION-ARBITRATION."
457	MORNING. FROM THE "TALKS TOO MUCH" STUDIOS, LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN. FAB 4 (PLUS 1 PICK) SOMETIMES KNOWING WHICH PICKS TO TO EXCLUDE IS AS IMPORTANT AS WHICH PICKS TO INCLUDE. LAST WEEK, WE HIT FOUR OF FIVE, AND THE LONE MISS WAS A MISSISSIPPI STATE PICK THAT FAILED TO COVER AT SOUTHERN MISS. DID IT MATTER THAT THE THREE OTHER FINALISTS FLORIDA STATE, FLORIDA AND USC FOR THE LAST SPOT HIT? OF COURSE NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF CERTAIN GAMBLING RULES. NEVER PLAY CARDS WITH A GUY NICKNAMED AFTER A CITY. NEVER GO IN AGAINST A SICILIAN WHEN DEATH IS ON THE LINE. NEVER DOUBT THAT HINDSIGHT IS AS PURE AS A MOMMA'S LOVE. THAT LAST ONE IS PUT TO THE TEST AGAIN THIS WEEK AS THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PLAYABLE GAMES ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR. STILL, WE PLEDGED TO STAY WITHIN THE FIVE-GAME COUNT, AND IF IT'S NOT BROKEN, LET'S NOT FIX IT. THE 4-1 START IS QUITE ACCEPTABLE. SINCE THESE PICKS ARE FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY, HOPEFULLY YOU ARE DEALING WITH HOUSE ENTERTAINMENT CREDITS. AS FOR THIS WEEK, WE ARE KEENLY WATCHING A COUPLE OF BANKABLE TRENDS. FIRST, IT'S A COACHING CLICHE THAT YOU MAKE THE MOST IMPROVEMENT FROM WEEK ONE TO WEEK TWO. CLICHES HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY PROVE ROUTINELY TRUE. IF THAT'S THE CASE, THERE ARE FOUR GAMES THIS WEEKEND WITH TEAMS ARE MAKING THEIR SEASON DEBUT BECAUSE OF LAST WEEK'S WEATHER POSTPONEMENTS. SECOND, BE COGNIZANT OF TIME ZONES. TEAMS ESPECIALLY TEAMS WITH LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES WHO MAY TRAVEL ON THE CHEAP THAT CROSS THE COUNTRY ARE OFTEN AT A SUPREME DISADVANTAGE. WITH THAT IN MIND, LET'S GET TO WORK. LOUISVILLE MINUS-13 OVER HOUSTON. GETTING THE CARDINALS AT HOME FOR LESS THAN TWO TOUCHDOWNS IS A VERY APPEALING PRICE. WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THAT LOUISVILLE SCORED 24 POINTS IN THE FINAL QUARTER AND A HALF AFTER MAKING A QUARTERBACK CHANGE TO THE FLEET-FOOTED LAMAR JACKSON, WELL, THIS PRICE LOOKS MORE LIKE STEALING. OHIO STATE MINUS-40 OVER HAWAII. LET'S DO SOME MATH. THIS GAME KICKS OFF AT WHAT FEELS LIKE 9:30 A.M. FOR THE HAWAII PLAYERS, WHO SPENT AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS IN A PLANE TODAY. NOW, ADD IN THE FACT THAT OHIO STATE'S SECOND- OR THIRD-TEAM GUYS ARE STILL GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THE BALL, WELL, THAT PRICE SEEMS MORE AFFORDABLE. CLEMSON MINUS-17 OVER APPALACHIAN STATE. ONE TEAM HAS DESHAUN WATSON. THE OTHER BEAT HOWARD LAST WEEK NO NOT HOWARD SCHOOL OR EVEN SOME DUDE NAMED HOWARD. QUICK RUSHMORE OF HOWARD: DWIGHT HOWARD, HOWARD COSELL, HOWARD STERN AND RON HOWARD; WE'RE PRETTY SURE NONE OF THOSE GUYS WERE INVOLVED IN APP STATE'S WIN LAST WEEK EITHER. WE'RE ALSO PRETTY SURE ALL OF THOSE GUYS COULD SUIT UP WITH THE MOUNTAINEERS THIS WEEK AND IT WOULD NOT MATTER AGAINST CLEMSON. NOTRE DAME MINUS-12 OVER VIRGINIA. WE'RE BUYING THE IRISH, ESPECIALLY THE GREEN MACHINE DEFENSE THAT HELD TEXAS TO ITS WORST OFFENSIVE SHOWING SINCE SANTA ANNA PULLED UP TO THE ALAMO. NOTRE DAME HELD TEXAS TO 163 YARDS OF OFFENSE AND ALLOWED JUST TWO THIRD-DOWN CONVERSIONS IN 13 TRIES. NOW WE KNOW SOME OF THAT IS ONE TEXAS, BUT ARE WE READY TO SAY VIRGINIA IS THAT MUCH BETTER OFFENSIVELY THAN THE LONGHORNS? NO, NO WE ARE NOT. ARKANSAS MINUS-21 OVER TOLEDO. THIS IS ONE OF THE FOUR GAMES INVOLVING A TEAM MAKING ITS SEASON DEBUT AFTER TOLEDO'S GAME LAST WEEK WAS CANCELLED. THE ROCKETS PLAYED ABOUT TWO QUARTERS AND LED STONY BROOK 16-7 BEFORE WEATHER ENDED THE OPENER. ARKANSAS IS ROLLING AND BRET BIELEMA IS BEAMING. NOW FOR SOME RESEARCH (DON'T GET SPOILED), TOLEDO HAS FIVE NEW STARTERS ON THE OFFENSIVE LINE AND KAREEM HUNT, THE LEADING RUSHER IN THE MAC LAST YEAR WITH MORE THAN 1,600 YARDS, HAS BEEN SUSPENDED FOR THIS GAME. LAST WEEK AGAINST THE SPREAD: 4-1 (80 PERCENT) THIS SEASON AGAINST THE SPREAD: 4-1 (80 PERCENT) TENNESSEE LINEBACKER CURT MAGGITT CELEBRATES STOPPING MISSOURI ON 3RD DOWN DURING THE VOLS' FOOTBALL GAME AGAINST THE MISSOURI TIGERS ON SATURDAY, NOV. 22, 2014, AT NEYLAND STADIUM IN KNOXVILLE, TENN. TENNESSEE LINEBACKER CURT MAGGITT CELEBRATES STOPPING MISSOURI ON... PHOTO BY DOUG STRICKLAND /TIMES FREE PRESS. SEC ITEMS OF INTEREST AS WE DO EVERY WEEK IN THIS SPACE, WE'LL OFFER UP FIVE THINGS TO KEEP AN EYE ON ACROSS THE SEC. 1. IS TENNESSEE READY FOR THE MOMENT? FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE PHILLIP FULMER WAS INVOLVED, BIG ORANGE NATION HAS EVERY REASON TO SALIVATE ABOUT THE THOUGHT OF UT WINNING A BIG GAME. FOR FAR TOO LONG THE MINDSET OF THE PROGRAM AND ITS FANS HAS BEEN A REALISTIC VIEW OF HOPING TO COMPETE AGAINST THE BEST TEAMS IN THE NATION. NOW, THE VOLS ARE AMONG THEM. AFTER A RIVER OF HIGH-PROFILE RECRUITING CLASSES, TENNESSEE IS RANKED IN THE AP POLL FOR ONLY THE FOURTH TIME SINCE THE START OF 2008. NOW, THEY HAVE TO PROVE THEY BELONG WITH THE UPPER CRUST ON SATURDAYS AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE ON THE RECRUITING TRAIL. 2. STAYING WITH THE VOLS-SOONERS, WHICH DEFENSE WILL DELIVER THE MOST STOPS? EACH OFFENSE HAS AN ONSLAUGHT OF TALENT AND MYRIAD OF OPTIONS, ESPECIALLY COMING OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. IN FACT, IF YOU WERE GOING TO LIST THE BEST RUNNING BACK TANDEMS IN THE COUNTRY, OKLAHOMA'S SAMAJE PERINE AND JOE MIXON AND TENNESSEE'S JALEN HURD AND ALVIN KAMARA ARE AMONG THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY. SO THE PRESSURE ON EACH DEFENSE AND THE PRESSURE ON EACH OFFENSE TO CONSEQUENTLY KEEP SERVE IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SHOOTOUT IS PARAMOUNT. 3. LSU OPENS FOR REAL. AFTER THE DRESS REHEARSAL THAT WAS THE LSU RAINOUT LAST WEEK, THE TIGERS GO TO MISSISSIPPI STATE FOR A LATE-NIGHT KICK IN STARKVILLE. THE BULLDOGS HAVE ALL-STAR CANDIDATE DAK PRESCOTT AT QUARTERBACK AND NEED TO FIND ANSWERS AT OTHER SPOTS. THE TIGERS HAVE ALL-STAR CANDIDATES ALL OVER THE FIELD AND NEED TO FIND ANSWERS AT QUARTERBACK. 4. HOW MANY DOES NICK CHUBB GET? THE STAR GEORGIA RUNNING BACK HAS NINE CONSECUTIVE 100-YARD-PLUS RUSHING EFFORTS HEADING INTO SATURDAY'S KILL SHOT AT VANDY. AS BAD AS VANDY'S HOME-OPENING, 14-12 DEBACLE AGAINST WESTERN KENTUCKY WAS, THE DEFENSE LOOKED PRETTY SHARP AT TIMES. JOB NO. 1 FOR EVERY GEORGIA FOE IS TO TRY TO SLOW CHUBB, BUT THAT'S NOT AN EASY TASK. IF WE SET THE BASELINE AT 150 YARDS WHICH IS KIND OF STARTING POINT FOR CHUBB WE THINK HE GOES OVER. 5. KENTUCKY-SOUTH CAROLINA, WHAT WILL HAPPEN? AS TFP SEC ACE AND PRESS ROW CO-HOST DAVID PASCHALL SAID ON THE AIR THIS WEEK, IT'S BEEN SINCE THE RICH BROOKS REGIME THAT KENTUCKY HAS WON AN SEC ROAD GAME. YEP, ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2009. THAT SAID, THE GAMECOCKS ARE NOT GOING TO BE CONFUSED TO THE FUN-N-GUN BUNCH STEVE SPURRIER ORGANIZED AT FLORIDA BACK IN THE 1990S. IN A LOT OF WAYS, THIS COULD BE A BOWL-ELIMINATOR FOR TWO TEAMS SCANNING THEIR SCHEDULES AND HUNTING FOR SIX WINS. A FRESHLY PAINTED NFL FOOTBALL LOGO IS SHOWN IN THE SOUTH END ZONE OF CENTURYLINK FIELD IN SEATTLE IN THIS JAN. 14, 2015, PHOTO. A FRESHLY PAINTED NFL FOOTBALL LOGO IS SHOWN... PHOTO BY ASSOCIATED PRESS /TIMES FREE PRESS. NFL IS HERE OK, THE NFL STARTS TONIGHT. LET'S DO FIVE WILD PREDICTIONS FOR THE LOOMING YEAR FOR THE (CUE RON JAWORSKI) THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE. 1. ROGER GOODELL GETS A CONTRACT EXTENSION. FORGET THE HAND-WRINGING AND THE CALLS FOR HIS GIG, GOODELL'S BOSSES ARE PLEASED WITH HIS DOING. THERE WILL BE SOME OVERHAULS WITHIN THE CORPORATE FLOW CHART, BUT BOTTOM LINE IS GOODELL HAS BEEN DRIVING THE BUS AS REVENUES HAVE GONE FROM $3 BILLION TO MORE THAN $8 BILLION IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. 2. BUFFALO'S REX RYAN IS COACH OF THE YEAR. HOW ABOUT THAT? BUFFALO'S SEXY REXY HAS A DEFENSE THAT IS POTENTIALLY DOMINANT AND HAS A DEFENSIVE LINE THAT IS OUTSTANDING. HE LIKES THE MOBILITY OF TYROD TAYLOR AT QUARTERBACK AND WILL RIDE SHADY MCCOY TO THE PLAYOFFS. IT'S 2015 THE YEAR OF B-REX. 3. SAM BRADFORD IS THE COMEBACK PLAYER OF THE YEAR. IF BRADFORD STAYS HEALTHY, THIS IS NOT THAT BIG OF A LEAP. BUT PICKING BRADFORD TO STAY HEALTHY IS A RISKY CALL. THAT SAID, IF STAYS UPRIGHT, HE COULD EMERGE AS AN MVP CANDIDATE IN CHIP KELLY'S OFFENSE. 4. TONIGHT'S STEELERS-PATRIOTS GAME SETS TV RECORDS FOR THE MOST WATCHED REGULAR-SEASON SPORTING EVENT EVER. OK, WE ALL KNOW THE NFL IS THE MONOLITH OF POP CULTURE IT'S THE MOST-WATCHED VEHICLE ON FIVE DIFFERENT NETWORKS AND WITH ALL THE HYPE AND HYPERBOLE AROUND THE DEFLATEGATE DEBACLE, THE ATTENTION FOR A TEAM IN THE SEASON OPENER HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER. 5. THIS IS PEYTON MANNING'S LAST SEASON. WE CAN SEE A SCENARIO THAT LATE IN THE SEASON, WITH A POSTSEASON SPOT ALREADY SECURED, MANNING SAYS THIS IT. THEN HE LEADS THE BRONCOS TO THE DIVISIONAL ROUND WHERE THEY ARE BOUNCED IN INDIANAPOLIS, A FITTING PLACE FOR HIS FINALE. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE GAME, BUTCH JONES IS THERE TO TRY TO MAKE MANNING THE HIGHEST PAID COLLEGE QUARTERBACK COACH EVER, BUT NBC LURES HIM TO BE THE SUNDAY NIGHT COMMENTATOR WITH AL AND CHRIS WITH A MONSTER DEAL AND TWO NEW AUTOMOBILES. "MAN I LOVE THAT NEW CAR SMELL." THIS AND THAT COOL TEAMMATE STORY OF THE DAY: NEW YORK JETS CORNERBACK DARRELLE REVIS LEFT BOSE HEADPHONES IN THE LOCKERS OF EACH OF HIS TEAMMATES WITH A NOTE THAT SAID, "HERE'S A LITTLE GIFT TO GET THINGS GOING. LET'S GO JETS. DARRELLE." WELL-PLAYED SIR. COOL DEDICATION STORY OF THE DAY. NEVIN ASHLEY MADE HIS BIG LEAGUE DEBUT LAST NIGHT AND DOUBLED IN HIS FIRST AT-BAT. DUDE HAD SPENT 10 YEARS IN THE MINORS HTTP://WWW.CBSSPORTS.COM/MLB/EYE-ON-BASEBALL/25296373/NEVIN-ASHLEY-DOUBLES-IN-RUN-IN-BIG-LEAGUE-DEBUT-AFTER-10-YEARS-IN-MINORS .

NOT SURE THIS WILL WORK, BECAUSE IF THEY TRY TO MAKE THIS ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE CAMPY HOME RUN THAT WAS PATRICK SWAYZE'S BRILLIANCE IN THE ORIGINAL THAT WAS SO BAD IT WAS GOOD, WELL, IT COULD BE ROUGH. WE HAVE A FEELING THAT THIS COULD BE ANOTHER RED DAWN DEBACLE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. TODAY'S QUESTION NEWS OUT THAT EDDIE MURPHY IS BEING HONORED WITH THE HIGHEST COMEDIC HONOR IN THE LAND HTTP://WWW.HUFFINGTONPOST.COM/ENTRY/EDDIE-MURPHY-TO-RECEIVE-NATIONS-TOP-PRIZE-FOR-HUMOR_55F06680E4B002D5C07791F2 .

WITH THAT IN MIND, WHAT'S YOUR NOMINATIONS FOR THE RUSHMORE OF EDDIE MURPHY VEHICLES? AND YES, SNL HAS TO COUNT, AS WILL HIS STAND-UP ROUTINES. GO AND REMEMBER THE MAILBAG.

462	ANDROID MARKET SHARE STAYS STEADY IN US BUT SINKS DEEPER IN EUROPE MORE THAN A QUARTER OF SMARTPHONE BUYERS ACROSS EUROPE JUMPED SHIP FROM ANDROID TO IOS, WHICH SAW SOLID GAINS ACROSS MOST OF THE CONTINENT, SAYS RESEARCH FIRM KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH. BY LANCE WHITNEY @LANCEWHIT SEPTEMBER 2, 2015 8:03 AM PDT UPDATED: SEPTEMBER 2, 2015 8:03 AM PDT ANDROID REMAINS TOP DOG AROUND THE WORLD BUT CONTINUES TO SHED MARKET SHARE IN EUROPE. CNET ANDROID REMAINS BY FAR THE TOP MOBILE OS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, BUT ITS MARKET SHARE CONTINUES TO LOSE GROUND EXCEPT IN THE US. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY, ANDROID'S SLICE OF THE SMARTPHONE MARKET FOR THE TOP FIVE EUROPEAN NATIONS (FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, SPAIN AND THE UK) DROPPED BY 4.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 71 PERCENT FROM 75.1 PERCENT FOR THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO, KANTAR REPORTED ON WEDNESDAY. THE CHANGES IN MARKET SHARE VARIED ACROSS THE BOARD. ANDROID'S SHARE TUMBLED BY 8.7 POINTS IN GERMANY AND 5.4 POINTS IN FRANCE BUT INCHED DOWN JUST 1.5 POINTS IN ITALY AND ACTUALLY GAINED ALMOST A POINT IN SPAIN. BUT IN THE US, ANDROID'S MARKET SHARE GREW BY 1.7 POINTS TO 65.6 PERCENT FROM 63.9 PERCENT DURING THE SAME THREE MONTHS IN 2014. THE SITUATION WAS THE REVERSE FOR APPLE'S IOS. THE IPHONE'S MARKET SHARE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY GREW BY 2.5 POINTS ACROSS EUROPE'S TOP FIVE COUNTRIES TO REACH 17 PERCENT. APPLE'S SMARTPHONE MARKET SHARE DECLINED BY 1.3 PERCENT IN THE US, THOUGH WAS LOWER THAN THE 2.3 PERCENT DROP FOR THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS. WHY IS ANDROID LOSING GROUND IN EUROPE BUT STAYING STEADY IN THE US, WHILE APPLE'S IOS IS DOING THE OPPOSITE? THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS, CAROLINA MILANESI, CHIEF OF RESEARCH AT KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH, TOLD CNET. THE SMARTPHONE MARKET IN EUROPE IS FACING CHALLENGING CONDITIONS. CERTAIN FLAGSHIP PHONES, SUCH AS SAMSUNG'S GALAXY S6, HAVE RECEIVED A MUTED RESPONSE FROM BUYERS. ALSO, SAMSUNG AND OTHER ANDROID PLAYERS ARE FACING INCREASED COMPETITION FROM LOCAL VENDORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN CHINA. ANOTHER REASON IS THE MATURITY OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET AS EVIDENCED BY FEWER FIRST-TIME SMARTPHONE BUYERS, ACCORDING TO KANTAR. THAT TYPE OF MATURITY INCREASES THE CHURN RATE, MEANING THE RATE AT WHICH EXISTING SMARTPHONE BUYERS SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM. AND IN EUROPE, THAT HIT ANDROID HARDER THAN IT DID APPLE. "THIS TYPE OF MARKET MATURITY INCREASES THE IMPACT OF CHURN ON OVERALL PERFORMANCE AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH ANDROID THIS TIME AROUND -- 27 PERCENT OF SMARTPHONE BUYERS ACROSS EUROPE LEFT ANDROID FOR IOS VERSUS 9 PERCENT IN THE US," DOMINIC SUNNEBO, BUSINESS UNIT DIRECTOR AT KANTAR WORLDPANEL COMTECH EUROPE, SAID IN A PRESS RELEASE. SWITCHING TO A DIFFERENT CARRIER TYPICALLY OCCURS LESS IN THE US THAN IN EUROPE. THAT'S BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE IN THE US ARE ON CONTRACT OR INSTALLMENT PLANS, WHILE MANY OF THOSE IN EUROPE ARE ON PREPAID PLANS, WHICH LEAD TO LONGER REPLACEMENT CYCLES. "I ALSO FEEL THAT THE 'I AM AN APPLE' AND 'I AM AN ANDROID' GROUPS ARE MORE CLEARLY DEFINED [IN THE US] THAN IN EUROPE," MILANESE ADDED. IN THE UNITED STATES, APPLE'S ANDROID RIVALS PROVIDED A TOUGHER FIGHT THAN THEY DID IN EUROPE. APPLE AND SAMSUNG STILL REIGN SUPREME IN THE US. BUT OTHER VENDORS SUCH AS LG HAVE GAINED MARKET SHARE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF NEW MOBILE DATA PLANS ON MID-RANGE PHONES, MILANESI TOLD CNET IN AUGUST. EARLY DEMAND FOR THE IPHONE IN THE US WAS STRONG, SO SALES WOULD NATURALLY BE LEVELING OFF BY THIS POINT, ESPECIALLY WITH APPLE DUE TO UNVEIL ITS NEXT IPHONE LINEUP ON SEPTEMBER 9. THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE AN OFF-YEAR FOR THE IPHONE IN WHICH APPLE INTRODUCES INTERIM MODELS -- THE IPHONE 6S AND IPHONE 6S PLUS -- WITH PERHAPS ONE OR TWO MAJOR NEW FEATURES BUT MOSTLY MINOR UPGRADES IN PROCESSOR SPEED AND A FEW OTHER FACTORS. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IPHONE SALES WILL SUFFER, ESPECIALLY IF APPLE LOWERS THE PRICE ON THE CURRENT IPHONE 6 LINEUP. "WHILE ALL EYES WILL BE ON APPLE'S NEW PRODUCTS, I WOULD SUGGEST PEOPLE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CURRENT IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS MARKET PERFORMANCE, SHOULD THE ACCUSTOMED PRICE DROP OCCUR AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 9 PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT," MILANESE SAID. "IN THE U.S., 32 PERCENT OF THE OVERALL SALES OF THE IPHONE 5S WERE GENERATED AFTER THE LAUNCH OF THE IPHONE 6." AND HOW DID ANDROID AND APPLE FARE ACROSS OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD? IN CHINA, ANDROID'S SMARTPHONE SHARE DROPPED BY 5.5 POINTS, WHILE THE IPHONE'S SLICE ROSE BY 5.9 POINTS. CHINA'S SMARTPHONE MARKET HAS WEAKENED AS OF LATE DUE TO OVERSATURATION, BUT THE IPHONE IS STILL A HOT DEVICE. FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, APPLE REPORTED THAT SALES IN GREATER CHINA MORE THAN DOUBLED TO $13.2 BILLION. IN AUSTRALIA, ANDROID'S SHARE PLUMMETED BY 10.5 POINTS TO 56.1 PERCENT, WHILE APPLE'S CUT ROSE BY 7.9 PERCENT TO 34.9 PERCENT. AND IN JAPAN, ANDROID'S SLICE OF THE MARKET DROPPED BY 7 POINTS, WHILE APPLE'S INCREASED BY 6.3 POINTS.

463	TATA STEEL CAPITALISED ON THE FEDERAL RESERVES OVERNIGHT DECISION TO KEEP US INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED BY BRINGING TO MARKET A RS25 BILLION ($376 MILLION) BLOCK TRADE OF TATA MOTORS SHARES BEFORE THE MARKET OPENED ON FRIDAY. WITHIN THREE HOURS OF THE FED ANNOUNCEMENT, TATA STEEL MADE ITS MOVE TO CASH IN ON SOME OF ITS NON-CORE ASSETS BY LAUNCHING AN ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OF TATA MOTOR SHARES IN TWO TRANCHES. INDIA IS SEEN AS VULNERABLE TO ANY US RATE RISE BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR PORTFOLIO CAPITAL OUTFLOWS FROM EMERGING MARKETS AS INVESTORS REALLOCATE FUNDS TO US MARKETS. SO FED CHAIRWOMAN JANET YELLENS NO-HIKE DECISION GAVE INDIAN MARKETS SOME RELIEF ON FRIDAY, ADDING 1% TO THE SENSEX STOCK INDEX BY THE CLOSE AND SHAVING 4 BASIS POINTS OFF 10-YEAR INDIAN GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS. A SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THE TATA MOTORS TRANSACTION CONFIRMED THAT THE BOOK OPENED AT THE UNUSUAL HOURS OF 3:00AM LOCAL TIME BECAUSE THE COMPANY WANTED TO WAIT FOR THE FED DECISION BEFORE DECIDING ON THE LAUNCH.IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN STARTED MUCH EARLIER ALSO BECAUSE TATA MOTORSS AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS TRADED UNTIL 1:30AM MUMBAI TIME. THE DEAL COMPRISED A $188 MILLION PUBLIC TRANCHE TO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND A PRIVATE TRANCHE OF THE SAME SIZE TO TATA SONS, THE DE FACTO HOLDING COMPANY OF TATA GROUP. IN THE PUBLIC TRANCHE THE TATA MOTORS SHARES WERE OFFERED AT RS324.50 RS338.05. THE FINAL PRICE WAS SETTLED AT THE LOWEST END OF THAT RANGE AND REPRESENTED A 4% DISCOUNT TO THE LAST CLOSE AT RS338.05. A TOTAL OF 77 MILLION SHARES WERE OFFLOADED IN BOTH TRANCHES, REPRESENTING 2.66% OF TATA MOTORSS SHARE CAPITAL. CITIGROUP WAS THE SOLE BOOKRUNNER OF THE TRANSACTION. HEDGE FUND INTEREST MANY HEDGE FUNDS SAW THE TATA MOTORS BLOCK AS AN OPPORTUNISTIC TRADE AND WILL BE HAPPY GIVEN THAT THE STOCK ENDED DOWN 2.3% ON FRIDAY, WHICH MEANS INVESTORS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE BLOCK EFFECTIVELY GOT A 1.7% GAIN IN A SINGLE-DAY TRADE. TATA MOTORS, WHICH MANUFACTURES JAGUAR LAND ROVER CARS IN INDIA, IS A VERY LIQUID STOCK AND AVERAGED $41 MILLION WORTH OF TRADE EVERY DAY OVER THE PAST MONTH. THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC TRANCHE EQUATES TO ONLY 4.5 DAYS' TRADING VOLUME. FOR THAT REASON HEDGE FUNDS WERE PARTICULARLY KEEN TO JOIN IN THE DEAL. ROUGHLY 70% OF THE PUBLIC TRANCHE WAS TAKEN UP BY HEDGE FUNDS, INCLUDING A LARGE ANCHOR ORDER, WHILE THE REMAINDER WAS SPLIT BETWEEN LONG-ONLY FUNDS AND DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS, SAID THE SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THE DEAL. TRADING AT A PRICE-TO-EARNINGS RATIO OF 7.4 TIMES ON A FORWARD TWELVE-MONTH BASIS, TATA MOTORS IS ONE OF THE CHEAPEST AUTO MANUFACTURERS IN ASIA, ALTHOUGH ITS GROWTH PROSPECTS MAY NOT BE AS BRIGHT AS JAPANESE PEERS LIKE TOYOTA AND MITSUBISHI MOTORS, WHICH BENEFIT FROM A SHARPLY DEVALUED CURRENCY. THE TATA MOTORS BLOCK TRADE FORMS PART OF TATA STEELS BROADER ATTEMPT TO MONETISE ITS NON-CORE ASSETS SO AS TO REDUCE ITS DEBT-GEARING RATIO, WHICH STOOD AT 213.7% AS OF THE END OF MARCH. IN THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD TO END-JUNE, THE STEEL MAKER RAISED RS10 BILLION BY SELLING PART OF ITS EQUITY PORTFOLIO, ACCORDING TO A COMPANY STATEMENT. TATA STEEL IS ONE OF THE EPICENTRES OF A SERIES OF CROSS SHARE HOLDINGS BETWEEN THE PUBLICLY-LISTED ENTITIES OF TATA GROUP. THE STEEL UNITS ROUGHLY $1 BILLION-WORTH OF EQUITY HOLDINGS INCLUDE 54.5% OF TATA SPONGE IRON, 50.9% OF TATA METALIKS, AND A 74.96% STAKE INTINPLATECOMPANY OF INDIA. COMPLETION OF THE DEAL SAW TATA STEEL LOWER ITS STAKE IN TATA MOTORS TO 5.5%, WHILE TATA SONSS STAKE INCREASED TO 25.7% AND REMAINS AS THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER. TATA MOTORS SHARES ARE DOWN 33% YEAR-TO-DATE, LAGGING SOME WAY BEHIND SENSEXS 4.3% LOSS OVER THE SAME PERIOD. THE COMPANY REPORTED LOWER MARGINS DUE TO NEW PLANT EXPENSES AND HIGHER MARKETING SPENDING, WHILE ITS CHINA BUSINESS ALSO SUFFERED FROM CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. HAVING SOLD 300,000 VEHICLES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR VERSUS A TARGET OF AROUND 420,000, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT TATA MOTORS WILL REACH ITS ANNUAL TARGET OF 500,000 CAR SALES, NOMURA ANALYST KAPIL SINGH SAID IN A RESEARCH NOTE. IN THE QUARTER ENDING JUNE THE AUTOMAKER REPORTED A PROFIT AFTER TAX OF RS27.7 BILLION, A 49% DECLINE FROM A YEAR EARLIER. JP MORGAN ANALYSTADITYA MAKHARIA, THOUGH, SAID CURRENT VALUATIONS ARE NOT DEMANDING, ADDING THAT AN IMPROVING BUSINESS OUTLOOK IN INDIAAND NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES WILL BENEFIT SALES IN THE FINAL MONTHS OF THE YEAR.

464	AS A RIDER TO THE PRESS RELEASE BY THE GOVERNOR OF GOMBE STATE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE 19 NORTHERN GOVERNORS FORUM ALHAJI KASHIM SHETTIMA LAMENTING ON HOW THE NORTH IS DRAGGING THE REST OF THE ENTITY CALLED NIGERIA BACKWARDS, I PRESENT THIS PEACE OF HISTORY TO SHOW THAT THE NORTH IS NOTHING BUT A DOG IN THE MANGER TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND A VERY STRONG CASE FOR BIAFRAS SELF DETERMINATION QUEST. THE REASON FOR THE DECISION OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO AMALGAMATE THE TWO INCOMPATIBLE TERRITORIES WAS PURELY FINANCIAL OR ECONOMIC. THE NORTHERN PROTECTORATE WAS NOT ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. IT HAD BECOME A GREAT DRAIN ON THE BRITISH TAX PAYER. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SOUTHERN PROTECTORATE WAS NOT JUST ECONOMICALLY BUOYANT, IT WAS PRODUCING SURPLUSES EVERY YEAR. THE BRITISH DESIGN WAS, THEREFORE, TO REMOVE THE NORTHERN FINANCIAL BURDEN FROM ITS OWN NECK AND HANG IT ON THE NECK OF THE HAPLESS SOUTHERN PROTECTORATE; ACCORDING TO LORD HARCOURT, THE BRITISH COLONIAL SECRETARY, UNIFICATION OF NIGERIA DEMANDED BOTH METHOD AND A MAN. THE MAN WAS TO BE LORD LUGARD AND THE METHOD WAS TO BE THE MARRIAGE OF THE TWO ENTITIES. ACCORDING TO LORD HARCOURT: WE HAVE RELEASED NORTHERN NIGERIA FROM THE LEADING STRINGS OF THE TREASURY. THE PROMISING AND WELL CONDUCTED YOUTH IS NOW ON AN ALLOWANCE ON HIS OWN AND IS ABOUT TO EFFECT AN ALLIANCE WITH A SOUTHERN LADY OF MEANS. I HAVE ISSUED THE SPECIAL LICENSE AND SIR FREDERICK LUGARD WILL PERFORM THE CEREMONY. MAY THE UNION BE FRUITFUL AND THE COUPLE CONSTANT. THUS, IN THIS MARRIAGE, THE NORTH, RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, WAS TO BE MAN AND HUSBAND NIGERIA AND THE SOUTH, THE WOMAN AND WIFE. THE USE OF THE TERM, YOUTH (MAN) FOR THE NORTH AND LADY (WOMAN) FOR THE SOUTH WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT, NOR AN EXERCISE IN HUMOUR. IT WAS A DEADLY SERIOUS MATTER, WITH THE GAME PLAN BEING TO BRING THE TWO PARTIES TOGETHER IN ORDER TO GIVE THE NORTH POLITICAL POWER OVER THE SOUTH AND PERMANENT CONTROL OVER SOUTHERN RESOURCES. IN THE ENGLAND OF THE TIME OF LORD HARCOURT, MARRIED WOMAN HAD NO INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE OUTSIDE THEIR MARRIAGE. ALL THE WOMENS PROPERTY AND RESOURCES AUTOMATICALLY BECAME THE HUSBANDS. THE WOMAN COULD NOT ENTER INTO A CONTRACT IN HER OWN RIGHT. HER HUSBAND HAD TO CONCLUDE ALL HER CONTRACTS ON HER BEHALF. ALTHOUGH THIS POSITION ALTERED BY THE MARRIED WOMENS PROPERTY ACT OF 1882, LORD HARCOURT HAD THE COMMON LAW POSITION IN MIND WHEN HE DECIDED TO MARRY THE YOUNG MAN WITHOUT MEANS, TO THE YOUNG LADY OF MEANS. THAT LATTER WAS TO PROVIDE THE WHEREWITHAL FOR THE FORMER TO LIVE WELL AND BE MASTER OF THE HOUSE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. OMO OMORUYI HAS LAMENTED AS FOLLOWS, REGARDING THE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES OF THIS MARRIAGE ON THE SOUTHERN LADY OF MEANS: TODAY, THE SOUTHERN LADY OF MEANS IS RICHER AND THE BRIDEGROOM THE WELL CONDUCTED YOUTH FROM THE NORTH IS POORER AND POORER OVER THE YEARS, A SITUATION NOT EVEN ANTICIPATED IN 1914. HENCE THE HUSBAND IN THE TYPICAL NIGERIAN FASHION WOULD ENSURE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS MAINTAINED AT ALL COST, EVEN IF IT MEANS KILLING THE BRIDE IN ORDER TO TAKE OVER HER WEALTH. THIS IS THE SITUATION THE OIL PRODUCING PART OF THE SOUTH FINDS ITSELF IN TODAY. ACCORDING TO ALHAJI GAMBO JIMETA, THE NORTH (HUSBAND) WILL GO TO WAR OVER OIL. THE NORTHERN POLITICIANS UNDERSTOOD THE PLAN PERFECTLY AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED IT FAITHFULLY AND FERVENTLY SINCE THEN. THEY ARE WELL FOCUSED ON HOW TO CLING TO POWER, FOR THEY KNOW THAT THAT IS THE ROUTE TO SOUTHERN RESOURCES. HOW HAVE THEY RETAINED POWER? THE FORMULA HAS BEEN AN AMAZINGLY SIMPLE ONE: CONTROL OF THE ARMY AND MANIPULATION OF THE CENSUS FIGURES. ALL THIS, COMBINED WITH HELP FROM BRITISH ADMINISTRATORS OF NIGERIA RIGHT UP TILL INDEPENDENCE, HAVE ASSURED THE NORTH OF PERMANENT POLITICAL POWER AND CONTROL OF SOUTHERN RESOURCES. BRITISH MANIPULATION OF ACCESS TO POWER HAVING INSTALLED THE NORTH AS HUSBAND OF THE SOUTH AND MASTER OF NIGERIA IN 1914, THE BRITISH COLONIAL MASTER DID NOT LET MATTERS REST THERE. AT EVERY STAGE THEY ENSURED THAT THE REINS OF POWER WOULD REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF THEIR BELOVED PROTEGES. IT WILL BE RECALLED THAT AT THE 1950 NATIONAL CONFERENCE, THE NORTH DEMANDED AT LEAST 50 PER CENT OF THE SEATS IN THE CENTRAL LEGISLATURE, AS A CONDITION FOR BEING PART OF NIGERIA. THAT DEMAND WAS BASED ON THE CENSUS FIGURES THAT HAD BEEN RIGGED IN THEIR FAVOUR. MASTERS QUICKLY GRANTED THE NORTHERN DEMAND AND DISTRIBUTED THE SEATS IN FAVOR OF THE NORTH. BY : M.M.MBANAJA
465	GET AUTOGUIDE.COM IN YOUR INBOX LIKE AUTOGUIDE.COM ON FACEBOOK IN ORDER TO SHAKE UP THE LARGE SEDAN SEGMENT, NISSAN HAD TO SHOW OFF ITS EXPERTISE IN SEVERAL KEY ASPECTS. HERES WHAT WHAT REALLY STANDS OUTIN THE BRAND NEW 2016 NISSAN MAXIMA. FAST FACTS ENGINE: 3.5-LITER V6, 300 HP, 261 LB-FT TRANSMISSION: CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE AUTOMATIC PRICE: BASE, $33,235; AS TESTED, $40,685 (INCLUDING $825 IN DESTINATION FEES) FUEL ECONOMY: 22 CITY, 30 HIGHWAY, 25 COMBINED 1. DESIGN BORROWS FROM THE BEST IN THE BIZ THE 2016 NISSAN MAXIMA IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST LOOKING GENERATION OF THE SEDAN. SITTING 1.3 INCHES LOWER AND 2.2 INCHES LONGER, IT LOOKS MUCH LEANER THAN PAST MODELS, AND IS EASILY ONE OF SPORTIEST LOOKING CARS IN ITS SEGMENTS. MY FAVORITE ELEMENT OF THE EXTERIOR DESIGN IS THE APPEARANCE OF A FLOATING ROOF, ACHIEVED BY BLACKING OUT THE A-PILLAR AND A PORTION OF THE C-PILLAR. THE PLATINUM TRIM MODEL TESTED ALSO FEATURES TASTEFUL CHROME ACCENTS ON THE GRILLE AND REAR BUMPER, AND CHROME DOOR HANDLES. IM GLAD NISSAN DIDNT GO OVERBOARD WITH THE CHROME, AS THAT CAN MAKE A CAR LOOK TACKY AND CHEAP. I ALSO LOVE THE LOOK OF THE LED DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS THAT CREATE AN EASY TO RECOGNIZE FRONT PROFILE. THE BULGES AND FLARED WHEEL ARCHES ALSO HELP MAKE THE CAR STAND OUT AS SOMETHING THATS A BIT SPORTIER THAN OTHER LARGE SEDANS AND REMINISCENT OF THE MAZDA6. 2. INTERIOR DESIGN IMPRESSES EVEN WITH ITS SLICK EXTERIOR DESIGN, THE INTERIOR OF THIS MAXIMA IS WHAT REALLY STANDS OUT, SPECIFICALLY THE QUILTED PATTERNED LEATHER SEATS, A SURPRISING DETAIL TO SEE IN THIS SEGMENT. THE FRONT HALF OF THE CABIN IS SET UP NICELY, SURROUNDING THE FRONT TWO PASSENGERS AS IF THEYRE IN THEIR OWN POD SEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER. THE SEATS PROVED TO BE VERY COMFORTABLE OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL LONG TRIPS DURING MY WEEK OF TESTING. DESCRIBED AS ZERO GRAVITY SEATS, THEY WERE ALSO OUTFITTED WITH HEATED AND COOLED FUNCTIONS, THE LATTER OF WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY USEFUL DURING THIS HOT AND STICKY SUMMER. 3. FIT AND FINISH OF LUXURY GRADE ALSO NOTEABLE IS THE INTERIOR FIT AND FINISH IN ADDITION TO THE FANTASTIC MIX OF MATERIALS. FOR STARTERS, THE KNOBS AND SWITCHGEAR ARE REALLY HIGH QUALITY AND BORDER ON LUXURY CAR TERRITORY. WE COMPARED THE MAXIMA TO THE HYUNDAI GENESIS SEDAN, A VEHICLE THATS CLEARLY TARGETTING THE LUXURY CAR SEGMENT, AND THE NISSAN HAD NOTHING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT AGAINST THE HYUNDAI. IN FACT, LOOKING AT SOME OF THE ACCENTS INSIDE THE MAXIMA WILL SPUR YOUR IMAGINATION. THE WOOD TRIM HAS A THREE-DIMENSIONAL ASPECT TO IT, ANGLED TO SHOW OFF THE DETAILS A BIT MORE. 4. TECHNOLOGY IS ITS MIDDLE NAME NISSAN IS PACKING THE MAXIMA WITH NEARLY AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF COOL TECHNOLOGY. TAKE THE EIGHT-INCH INFOTAINMENT SCREEN, THAT IS CONTROLLABLE VIA A RESPONSIVE TOUCH SCREEN AND A KNOB ON THE CENTER CONSOLE BY THE GEAR SELECTOR. ITS A SMALL THING THAT HELPS MAKE THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM EASIER TO USE WHILE DRIVING. OF COURSE. THE MAXIMA IS LOADED WITH MORE TECHNOLOGY THAN JUST THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM. THERES SAFETY FEATURES LIKE A FORWARD COLLISION WARNING, FORWARD EMERGENCY BRAKING, REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT AND BLIND SPOT WARNING. THERES ALSO DRIVER ASSISTS LIKE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL AND A 360-DEGREE CAMERA. VERY LITTLE HAS BEEN LEFT OUT AND IT ALL WORKED VERY WELL TO MAKE THE CAR FEEL LIKE A REALLY WELL PACKAGED VEHICLE. 5. ENGINE A SWEET SPOT THE 3.5-LITER V6 ENGINE FOUND UNDER THE HOOD OF THE MAXIMA MAY BE FAMILIAR, BUT IS VERY HEAVILY REVISED WITH 60-PERCENT NEW PARTS. MAKING 300 HP AND 261 LB-FT OF TORQUE, THE OUTPUT IS ADEQUATE AND THE ENGINE RESPONSIVE, BUT THE MOST EXCITING PART OF THE MOTOR IS JUST HOW NICE IT SOUNDS. NISSAN FANS WILL EASILY RECOGNIZE THE HOWL OF A VQ ENGINE, AND THE MAXIMA CERTAINLY HAS THAT VOCAL PERSONALITY. 6. CVT ISNT A DIRTY WORD THAT ENGINE IS MATED TO NISSANS XTRONIC CVT, A TRANSMISSION THATS KNOWN FOR SUCKING THE FUN OUT OF POTENT CARS. FORTUNATELY IN THIS CASE, THE CVT IS VERY QUICK TO ADJUST ITS GEAR RATIO TO DELIVER SWIFT ACCELERATION WHEN NEEDED AND THRIFTY FUEL ECONOMY WHEN YOU TAKE IT EASY ON THE THROTTLE. A HANDY FEATURE IS THE SPORT BUTTON. AS SOON AS YOU PUT THE MAXIMA IN THIS MODE, THE TRANSMISSION PRETENDS TO BE A CONVENTIONAL AUTO, AND CHANGES GEARS BETWEEN PRE-SET GEAR RATIOS, MAKING THE CAR FEEL FAR MORE EXCITING THAN ITS CVT WOULD SUGGEST IN THE NORMAL MODE. 7. 4DSC MAY BE A BIT MUCH BUT ITS NOT FAR OFF YOU MAY HEAR NISSAN CALL ITS BIG SEDAN 4DSC, OR THE FOUR-DOOR SPORTS CAR. THIS IS A NICKNAME THE COMPANY USED ON THE MAXIMA SINCE 1989, WHEN THE MAXIMA PACKED A 190-HP 3.0-LITER V6 ENGINE. NOW, DESPITE THE MAXIMA WEIGHING IN UNDER 3,600 LBS, THE CAR STILL FEELS RELATIVELY SPORTY. ITS HEAVY STEERING WHEEL PROVIDED A CONFIDENT FEEL ON THE ROAD, AND EVEN HAD SOME FEEDBACK, UNLIKE OTHER MODERN CARS THAT ARE VERY ARTIFICIAL IN TERMS OF FEEL. WHILE THE CAR IS RELATIVELY LIGHTWEIGHT, THE STEERING ENGAGING AND THE POWERTRAIN RESPONSIVE, DONT GET TOO CARRIED AWAY WITH THE 4DSC CLAIMS. THIS IS STILL A LARGE CAR AND DOESNT QUITE FEEL LIKE IT CAN CARVE CANYONS LIKE A SPORTS CAR. 8. FUEL ECONOMY IS SUPERB WHILE THE CAR IS EXCITING TO DRIVE IN THE SPORT MODE, THE CVT HELPS THE 300-HP SEDAN STRETCH OUT ITS FUEL TANK. A LONG DRIVE ROUTE THAT INVOLVED BOTH HIGHWAY AND SUBURBAN DRIVING SAW THE MAXIMA NET 26 MPG. ON A LONGER HIGHWAY DRIVE, THE MAXIMA SURPRISED FURTHER, EASILY GETTING OVER 30 MPG. IF FUEL ECONOMY IN YOUR FULL-SIZE SEDAN IS A CONCERN AND YOU DONT WANT A HYBRID THE MAXIMA SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST. 9. PRICE STARTING AT $33,235, THE BASE MAXIMA IS A LARGE SEDAN THAT IS REFINED AND WELL EQUIPPED. OPT TO GET THE PLATINUM MODEL WE TESTED AND YOULL SPEND JUST $40,685 FOR A CAR THAT EASILY KEEPS UP WITH PREMIUM GRADE VEHICLES FROM ACURA AND BUICK.

466	REVISION. NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) - A MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER AND ROBBERY WILL NOW BE CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE STABBING DEATH OF HIS GIRLFRIEND. PORSCHA CLARK, A 26-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF THREE, WAS FOUND STABBED TO DEATH INSIDE HER APARTMENT IN THE TRINITY HILLS VILLAGE COMPLEX ON SUNDAY NIGHT. CLARKS BOYFRIEND, 43-YEAR-OLD SAMUEL COPELAND, WAS IDENTIFIED AS A POSSIBLE SUSPECT IN HER MURDER. INVESTIGATORS SAID COPELAND WAS INVOLVED IN AN OVERNIGHT HIT-AND-RUN CRASH IN WARREN COUNTY WHILE DRIVING CLARKS CAR. HE FLED INTO A NEARBY WOODED AREA AND WAS ARRESTED MONDAY MORNING FOR THE HIT-AND-RUN. METRO DETECTIVES TRAVELED TO MCMINNVILLE MONDAY AFTERNOON TO CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATION INTO CLARKS MURDER. EARLIER THIS MONTH, POLICE SAID CLARK SWORE OUT A MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC ASSAULT WARRANT AGAINST COPELAND, SAYING HE PUNCHED HER IN THE BACK OF HER HEAD AND FACE AFTER SHE DECLINED TO GIVE HIM A RIDE HOME FROM HER APARTMENT. COPELAND FLED BEFORE POLICE ARRIVED. AT THE TIME, POLICE SAID CLARK DECLINED OFFICERS OFFERS TO ARRANGE FOR COUNSELING, SHELTER AND AN ORDER OF PROTECTION. THE DOMESTIC ASSAULT ARREST WARRANT ON COPELAND WAS STILL OUTSTANDING AT THE TIME OF CLARKS MURDER, DESPITE OFFICERS ATTEMPTS TO SERVE IT ON SEPT. 7. POLICE SAID CLARKS RELATIONSHIP WITH COPELAND APPARENTLY CONTINUED, WITH COPELAND REPORTEDLY PICKING UP ONE OF CLARKS CHILDREN FROM A CAREGIVER ON FRIDAY. CLARK AND COPELAND WERE ALSO REPORTEDLY SEEN ARGUING AT A NASHVILLE NIGHTCLUB OVER THE WEEKEND. COPELAND WAS CONVICTED OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN 1993 AND RECEIVED A 25-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. HE WAS ALSO CONVICTED OF ROBBERY THAT SAME YEAR AND RECEIVED A 6-YEAR SENTENCE.  MORE THAN HUNDRED TRUCKS LOADED WITH ESSENTIAL GOODS, COOKING GAS CYLINDERS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS WERE STALLED AT THE NEPAL-INDIA BORDER DUE TO THE AGITATION. METRO POLICE ARRESTED HIM IN 2007 FOR PAROLE VIOLATION. COPELAND REGISTERED WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS AN EX-CONVICT IN 2012. HE WAS ARRESTED THE FOLLOWING YEAR FOR MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC ASSAULT AGAINST HIS GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME. THAT CASE WAS RETIRED IN GENERAL SESSIONS COURT IN NOVEMBER 2013. INVESTIGATORS SAID THEY WILL BE SEEKING A CRIMINAL HOMICIDE WARRANT AGAINST COPELAND IN CONNECTION WITH CLARKS MURDER. OUTSIDE CLARK'S APARTMENT TUESDAY WERE FADED CHALK DRAWINGS OF A TURTLE, A SUN, A SPIDER IN A WEB AND A GAME OF HOPSCOTCH. NEIGHBORS SAID THEY WOULD OFTEN STEP OUT, LOOK DOWN THE HALL AND FIND CLARK DRAWING WITH HER THREE CHILDREN. THEY SAID A LITTLE NOTE WRITTEN ON A WALL COULDN'T BE MORE TRUE, "LOVE WAS HERE." "THE DANGER IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIPS IS REAL," SAID TRACY DETOMASI OF YWCA NASHVILLE. "A LOT OF TIMES, BECAUSE YOU LOVE THE PERSON AND YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH THEM, YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THEY CAN CHANGE. THEY WON'T DO THAT AGAIN. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE." "WE HAVE A CRISIS HOTLINE THAT'S 24 HOURS A DAY THAT THEY CAN CALL," DETOMASI CONTINUED. "THEY CAN CALL TO TALK. THEY CAN CALL TO GET A SAFETY PLAN. THEY CAN CALL TO GET INTO OUR SHELTER THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL. THE LOCATION IS CONFIDENTIAL. WE HAVE 51 BEDS, AND IT IS THE LARGEST IN TENNESSEE." YWCA OFFICIALS SAID WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS OUTREACH, LETTING OTHERS KNOW HELP IS AVAILABLE.  "WE DON'T JUDGE THEM WHEN THEY WANT TO TELL THEIR STORIES." FOR MORE ON THE YWCA, CLICK HERE.

469	PADDLERS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF THE WORLD-RENOWNED NA WAHINE O KE KAI WOMENS OUTRIGGER CANOE RACE FROM MOLOKAI TO OAHU SUNDAY MORNING WERE SIMPLY DISAPPOINTEDAFTER TROPICAL STORM NIALA CANCELED THE EVENT. THE RACES TITLE SPONSOR, HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, ADDED EXTRA FLIGHTS FROM MOLOKAI TO HONOLULU FOLLOWING THE CANCELLATION, TO ACCOMMODATE THE HUNDREDS OF PADDLERS AFFECTED. KHON2 SPOKE TO SOME OF THOSE PADDLERS AND RACE OFFICIALS THAT ARRIVED ON OAHU SUNDAY MORNING, ONE DAY AFTER THEY LEARNED ABOUT THE HEARTBREAKING NEWS. THE LOOK ON THE PADDLERS FACES AT HONOLULU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS BAGGAGE CLAIM WAS LESS THAN THRILLED. (ITS) DISAPPOINTING, BUT (IM) GRATEFUL THEY MADE A WISE CHOICE, SAID STACEY SVADLENKA OF THE NEW HOPE CANOE CLUB. OUR LIVES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN CROSSING THE CHANNEL. RACE ORGANIZERS WERE ON THE SAME FLIGHT. IT WASNT AN EASY DECISION, SAID RACE DIRECTOR HANNIE ANDERSON. THE GIRLS PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THIS RACE A LOT OF MONEY, A LOT OF TRAINING. THE LAST TIME ORGANIZERS CANCELLED THE RACE WAS IN 1980. THIS YEARS CANCELLATION AFFECTED 72 CREWS AND 800 PADDLERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. KHON2 ASKED NEW HOPE CANOE CLUB PADDLER KEHAUNANI LLANOS HOW DANGEROUS WOULD IT HAVE BEEN HAD THE ORGANIZERS NOT CHOSEN TO CANCEL THE RACE. AS WE WERE FLYING OVER, ALL WE COULD SEE WERE WHITE CAPS, LLANOS RESPONDED. WE COULD SEE THE OCEAN LOOKS ANGRY, THE CURRENTS PUSHING EVERY WHICH WAY. ONE MEMBER OF THE RACE COMMITTEE SAID ITS ABOUT PROTECTING THE PARTICIPANTS. MANY ARE INEXPERIENCED, SAID RACE COMMITTEE MEMBER CARLEEN ORNELLES. THAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR. KHON2 ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE WERE CREWS WHO CHOSE NOT TO GET ON A PLANE BACK TO OAHU, AND DECIDED TO MAKE THEIR WAY BY BOAT INSTEAD TO MAUNALUA BAY IN HAWAII KAI. SOME PADDLERS HAD TO SEE THE ROUGH CONDITIONS IN THE WATERS FOR THEMSELVES. AFTER JUST NOW CROSSING, COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE, SAID JENNIFER POLCER OF THE WAIKIKI BEACH BOYS. SAFETY FIRST AND FOREMOST. THE CONDITIONS OUT THERE WERE REALLY, REALLY BIG. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHILE MANY ARE BACK ON OAHU, THE HEADACHE ISNT OVER YET. WE HAVE TO TAKE OUR CANOES APART, SVADLENKA SAID. UNRIG THE CANOES, FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THEM BACK. BUT THE COMPETITIVE SPIRIT IS STILL THERE. MOST OF US TRAIN NINE MONTHS FOR THIS, POLCER SAID. THIS IS WHAT WE TRAIN FOR, THIS ONE DAY. SO, ITS WHAT, 365 MORE DAYS TO GO NEXT YEAR?
470	ARCHIVE - TEST, AFTER TEST AND A NUMBER OF BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS LATER, THINGS WERE STARTING TO LOOK DIM, FOR OLIVIA - HER BRAIN WAS FILLING WITH FLUID. BETSY SAID THE DOCTOR TRIED HER BEST TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS HAPPENING. "SHE USED ALL THESE MEDICAL TERMS, AND THEN EVENTUALLY SAID, 'WHAT SHE'S TELLING YOU, IS THAT SHE'S DYING, AND THERE'S NOT ANYTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.'" KURT CHIMED IN, SAYING, "IT WAS PRETTY MUCH GUT-WRENCHING.  SHELLER AND THE WHISTLEBLOWER PROVIDED THE BASIS FOR AN INVESTIGATION BY THE U.S. IT WAS UH...YEAH." WHILE TALKING ABOUT IT CAN LEAVE THEM SPEECHLESS, AT TIMES, THAT'S THE LAST THING KURT AND BETSY WANT OTHERS AROUND THEM TO BE. THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR SYMPATHY. "BUT ACTING LIKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN DOESN'T HELP," BETSY SAID. "AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO." THE MILLERS ARE NOT ALONE IN THEIR JOURNEY. METHODIST WOMEN'S HOSPITAL HOLDS A "REMEMBRANCE OF LIFE" CEREMONY, EVERY YEAR, FOR OTHER GRIEVING FAMILIES. IT'S A KICK-OFF TO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS MONTH, WHICH IS OCTOBER - A TIME TO REMEMBER. "I REMEMBER JUST LAYING ON THE SCOUCH AFTER COMING HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL, AND THINKING, 'I'M NEVER GOING TO FEEL BETTER,'" BETSY SAID. AND A TIME TO HEAL. "I LIKE TO SAY THAT YOU DON'T MOVE ON, BUT YOU MOVE FORWARD." SUNDAY'S "REMEMBRANCE OF LIFE" CEREMONY MARKS THE FIRST OF MANY EVENTS, SALTED FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER. A 5K RUN/WALK IS SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 9TH ALONG THE KEYSTONE TRAIL. IT'LL BE PUT ON BY HEALING EMBRACE. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE, HEAD TO: HTTPS://RUNSIGNUP.COM/RACE/NE/OMAHA/HEALSTOTHEPAVEMENTFORPREGNANCYINFANTLOSSAWARENESS AS WITH ANY LOVE STORY, THIS ONE, TOO, COMES WITH HIGHS AND LOWS. HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS, KURT AND BETSY MILLER, MET WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG AND REUNITED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. FIRST CAME LOVE, THEN CAME MARRIAGE AND YOU GUESSED IT - A BABY WAS ON THE WAY.  "EVERY DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT, ALMOST THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THING, WAS SUPER HEALTHY," BETSY SAID. "EVERYTHING WAS FINE. I NEVER FELT SICK." AT R34 WEEKS, STILL, NOTHING SEEMED TOO ALARMING. "BUT WHEN SHE MEASURED MY STOMACH WITH A TAPE MEASURE," BETSY SAID, "I WAS THE SAME SIZE THAT MY STOMACH HAD BEEN THE APPOINTMENT PRIOR." AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION WAS IN ORDER. BABY OLIVIA WASG WELCOMED TO THE WORLD WEIGHING JUST TWO POUNDS.
471	THE BELOW REPORT FROM THE WASHINGTON TIMES SHOWS SOME OF THE UNREST THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING EXPERIENCED IN NEPAL. ALTHOUGH THIS IS 200KM SOUTH OF KATHMANDU THE POTENTIAL REPERCUSSIONS ARE PREVENTING THE IES TEAM FROM GOING BACK AT THIS STAGE. HOPEFULLY THOUGH WE WILL BE HEADING BACK AS SOON ONCE WORD GETS BACK TO IHQ THAT IT IS NOT AS BAD AS THE REPORTS MAKE IT OUT TO BE. ESPECIALLY IN AND AROUND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH... VITAL SUPPLIES TO NEPAL WERE CUT OFF TODAY AS HUNDREDS OF PROTESTERS WHO WERE OPPOSING THE NEW CONSTITUTION HAD BLOCKED KEY TRADE CHECKPOINTS BETWEEN INDIA AND NEPAL. MORE THAN HUNDRED TRUCKS LOADED WITH ESSENTIAL GOODS, COOKING GAS CYLINDERS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS WERE STALLED AT THE NEPAL-INDIA BORDER DUE TO THE AGITATION. THE PROTESTERS BELONGED TO THE JOINT MADHESI FRONT, CLAIMED THE NEW CONSTITUTION DOES NOT GUARANTEE THEM ENOUGH RIGHTS AND REPRESENTATION TO THE MADHESI AND THARU COMMUNITIES WHO LIVE IN SOUTHERN NEPAL. MADHESIS ARE INDIAN-ORIGIN INHABITANTS OF THE TERAI PLAINS BORDERING INDIA. AT LEAST 40 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN OVER A MONTH OF CLASHES BETWEEN POLICE AND PROTESTERS FROM THE MADHESI AND THARU COMMUNITIES AND ETHNIC MINORITIES WHO SAY THE NEW INTERNAL BORDERS LEAVE THEM UNDER-REPRESENTED IN THE COUNTRY'S PARLIAMENT. THE BLOCKED CHECKPOINT IN BIRGUNJ, 200 KM SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL, IS AS A MAJOR TRANSIT POINT BETWEEN NEPAL AND INDIA. THOUGH THE SHUTDOWN IN THE REGION WAS LIFTED TEMPORARILY TODAY DUE TO THE MUSLIM FESTIVAL OF EID-UL-AZHA, THE BLOCKADE CONTINUED AT THE NEPAL-INDIA BORDER CHECK POINT AFFECTING NORMAL LIFE. INDIAN AMBASSADOR TO NEPAL RANJIT RAE TODAY HELD SEPARATE MEETINGS WITH PRIME MINISTER SUSHIL KOIRALA, CPN-UML CHAIRMAN KP OLI AND SENIOR LEADER MADHAV KUMAR NEPAL. ACCORDING TO REPORTS, THE LEADERS TOLD MR RAE THAT THE TWO NATIONS SHOULD IMPROVE THEIR RELATIONS AND THE PROBLEMS OF NEPAL SHOULD BE DEALT BY NEPALI LEADERS THEMSELVES. THE LEADERS CLAIM THAT THE NEPAL-BOUND CARGO AND FREIGHT HAVE BEEN LEFT STRANDED AT THE INDIAN SIDE OF THE BORDER AND HAS ALLEGEDLY NOT BEEN GIVEN CLEARANCE. MR RAE STATED THAT THE PROBLEMS WERE NOT CREATED DUE TO INDIA, AND THE OBSTRUCTION WAS CAUSED BY THE PROTESTS IN NEPAL'S TERAI AND MADHES REGION.

472	NEVER MISS AN UPDATE FOLLOW APPLEINSIDER TEARDOWN OF APPLE TV SIRI REMOTE FINDS SAME TOUCH CONTROLLER AS IPHONE 5S & IPAD AIR BY NATE HANSON TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2015, 08:17 AM PT (11:17 AM ET) A TEARDOWN OF THE FIRST APPLE TV AND ITS NEW VOICE-ENABLED SIRI REMOTE HAS DISCOVERED THE CONTROLLER SPORTS THE SAME BROADCOM-MADE TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLLER THE COMPANY ALREADY USES IN THE IPHONE 5S, IPHONE 5C AND IPAD AIR. SOURCE: IFIXIT NEARLY TWO WEEKS AFTER FIRST GETTING OUR HANDS ON WITH THE NEW APPLE TV, IFIXIT HAS COMPLETED THEIR FULL TEARDOWN OF THE DEVICE AND IT'S COMPANION REMOTE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM THE THIRD-GENERATION APPLE TV ARE FOUND IN THE NEW SIRI REMOTE WITH ITS GLASS TOUCH SURFACE. THE GLASS SURFACE OF THE NEW REMOTE UTILIZES THE SAME BROADCOM TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLLER (BCM5976C1KUB6G) FOUND IN EARLIER IPHONES AND IPADS. THE REMOTE WAS ALSO FOUND TO INCLUDE AN ACCELEROMETER AND GYROSCOPE FOR NAVIGATION AND GAMEPLAY. SOURCE: IFIXIT WITH THE ADDITION OF A QUALCOMM BLUETOOTH RADIO IN THE SIRI REMOTE, USERS NO LONGER NEED TO AIM THE REMOTE AT THEIR APPLE TV. HOWEVER, APPLE DID CONTINUE TO INCLUDE IR TECHNOLOGY WHICH CAN BE USED TO CONTROL THE POWER AND VOLUME ON YOUR TELEVISION. THE APPLE TV BOX ITSELF IS A HALF-INCH TALLER AND 50 PERCENT HEAVIER THAN IT'S PREDECESSOR, MOSTLY DUE TO A LARGER POWER SUPPLY AND HEATSINK. IFIXIT SUGGESTS THAT THIS BEEFIER POWER SUPPLY IS NEEDED TO POWER THE DUAL-CORE A8 PROCESSOR. SOURCE: IFIXIT APPLE HAS ALSO DITCHED THE OPTICAL AUDIO-OUT PORT AND ADDED A USB-C PORT, WITH THE LATTER CURRENTLY BEING FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES ONLY. THE WI-FI CHIP INSIDE THE NEW APPLE TV ALSO RECEIVED A BUMP TO INCLUDE SPEEDIER 802.11AC, AND THE AUDIO OUTPUT HAS BEEN UPGRADED FROM DOLBY DIGITAL 5.1 TO 7.1. THE NEW APPLE TV WITH SIRI REMOTE COMES IN 32- AND 64-GIGABYTE MODELS, PRICED AT $149 AND $199, RESPECTIVELY. THEY ARE EXPECTED SOMETIME IN OCTOBER.

473	ELIZABETH CLAIRE WRIGHT HAD BEEN VISITING HER HUSBAND AT HIS HOME NEAR MALINDI WHEN THE ATTACK HAPPENED POLICE BELIEVE ELIZABETH CLAIRE WRIGHT HEARD THE DOGS BARKING AND LET THEM OUT OF THEIR CAGE TO FEED THEM BUT WAS SET ON INSTEAD PHOTO: ALAMY A BRITISH WOMAN HAS DIED AFTER SHE WAS ATTACKED BY THREE ROTTWEILERS AT THE BEACHSIDE HOME OF HER KENYAN HUSBAND, IT HAS EMERGED. ELIZABETH CLAIRE WRIGHT, 55, A TEACHING ADMINISTRATOR FROM HORSHAM IN SURREY, WAS VISITING HER HUSBAND FRED KARISA, 31, AT HIS HOME IN THE FISHING VILLAGE OF WATAMU, ON THE INDIAN OCEAN COAST, WHEN THE ATTACK HAPPENED ON AUGUST 18. POLICE BELIEVE SHE HEARD THE DOGS BARKING AND LET THEM OUT OF THEIR CAGE TO FEED THEM BUT WAS SET ON INSTEAD. MR KARISA TOLD POLICE HE HAD WARNED HIS WIFE NOT TO APPROACH THE DOGS BEFORE LEAVING FOR A DAY TRIP TO THE NEARBY CITY OF MOMBASA. HE SAID HE RETURNED TO FIND HER BODY PART-EATEN BY THE DOGS. MRS WRIGHTS MOTHER JANET TOLD THE TELEGRAPH ON MONDAY THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD PREVIOUSLY LIVED WITH MR KARISA IN KENYA BUT HAD OPTED TO RETURN HOME TO LIVE WITH HER PARENTS IN THE FAMILYS COTTAGE IN A RURAL HAMLET OUTSIDE HORSHAM. WE JUST DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND I DONT THINK WE EVER WILL KNOW, MRS WRIGHT, 77, SAID. WE HAVE HEARD NOTHING FROM THE KENYAN POLICE , JUST THE SURREY CORONER. IF WE DID PURSUE IT, I THINK IT WOULD JUST CAUSE US MORE GRIEF. AT THE MOMENT, ITS CLOSURE. MRS WRIGHT, KNOWN BY FRIENDS AS LIZ, HAD WORKED AS THE PERSONAL ASSISTANT TO THE PRINCIPAL OF ST JOSEPHS SPECIAL NEEDS SCHOOL IN CRANLEIGH, SURREY FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. A TRIBUTE POSTED ON THE SCHOOLS WEBSITE SAID SHE WOULD BE REMEMBERED FOR HER HAPPY, KIND AND GENEROUS NATURE. SHE TOUCHED THE HEARTS OF COLLEAGUES, LEARNERS AND FAMILIES IN EQUAL MEASURE AND WILL BE HUGELY MISSED BY THE WHOLE ST JOSEPHS COMMUNITY, IT SAID. EARLY REPORTS IN KENYA SUGGESTED NEIGHBOURS HAD FOUND MRS WRIGHTS BODY AFTER HEARING WILD SCREAMS AND THAT MR KARISA WAS BEING TREATED AS A SUSPECT IN HER DEATH. DOUGLAS KANJA, THE POLICE COMMANDER FOR KILIFI COUNTY, SAID HOWEVER THERE WAS NO FOUL PLAY AND NO ARRESTS AND THE CASE HAD BEEN REFERRED TO A CORONER. THE DEATH IS SUBJECT TO AN INQUEST. THE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND FILE SENT TO THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS FOR THE INQUEST TO BE OPENED," HE SAID. "THE OUTCOME OF OUR INVESTIGATION ON THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH IS THAT SHE DIED FROM A SERIOUS DOG BITE. HE SAID MR KARISA TOLD POLICE HE HAD BEEN WARNED HIS WIFE NOT TO APPROACH THE DOGS BEFORE HE LEFT FOR MOMBASA. SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE WHEN SHE HEARD THEM BARKING AND THOUGHT THEY WERE HUNGRY AND NEEDED SOME FOOD, MR KANJA SAID. "THE DOGS MAULED HER TO DEATH WHEN OPENED THE CAGE TO FEED THEM. WHEN KARISA ARRIVED AT HIS HOUSE, HE FOUND THE DOGS FEEDING ON THE BODY BEFORE HE CAGED THEM. MRS WRIGHT HAD ARRIVED IN KENYA ON AUGUST 6 AND WAS DUE TO RETURN TO THE UK ON AUGUST 21, ACCORDING TO POLICE. TELEGRAPH.CO.UK
474	BABY MAMA MOVIEREVIEW SEP 24 POSTED BY JAMIE INSALACO Q: HOW MANY TALENTED ACTORS DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A CRAPPY MOVIE? A: FIVE. AT LEAST FIVE. WITNESS THAT TRAGEDY THAT ISBABY MAMA. IF YOU PLAN TO SEE THIS MOVIE; ITLL SPOIL WHAT LITTLEJOKES AND DRAMA THIS MOVIE HAS TO OFFER. HERES A BUNCH OF STUFF THAT BABY MAMA SHOULD HAVE LET GESTATE FOR A FEW MORE WEEKS. (OR MONTHS.) GO ALL THE WAY! THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH BABY MAMAIS THAT ITS A BROAD COMEDY THATS AFRAID OF ITS OWN SHADOW. THAT OPENING SCENE FEATURING THE MAN RUNNING FROM HIS DATE WITH BABY CRAZY TINA FEY JUST DOESNT WORK. THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD THE TABLECLOTH TUCKED INTO HIS PANTS OR SOMETHING; THAT KIND OF JOKE NEEDED SOME PHYSICAL COMEDY BARRIERS THAT SHOWED NO MATTER HOW BIG THE OBSTACLE, THAT GUY WAS GETTING OUT OF THAT RESTAURANT, BUT INSTEAD, WE GET THIS LAME PACKAGING THAT SETS THE TONE FOR THE REST OF THE FLICK. IN CASE YOURE WONDERING WHAT TONE THAT IS, ITS THIS: NEVERMIND, REIN IT IN! THAT AWFUL MONTAGE OF AMY POEHLER STUFFING HER FACE WITH SNACKS IS THE OPPOSITE OF FUNNY. I GET IT, SHES TRYING TO EAT FATTY FOODS TO GAIN WEIGHT, BUT MAN, POEHLER IS FUNNY; JUST GET OUT OF HER WAY AND LET HER BE FUNNY! EXPECTING WHAT, A SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK? THIS IS ONE OF MAYBE 4 LAUGHS IN THIS MOVIE. THE REST IS IN THE TRAILER. ITS COMEDY THATS SO LAME IT JUST CANT BE FUNNY. PRODUCT PLACEMENTS GALORE THEYRE EVEN ON THE FUCKING POSTER! THIS MOVIE IS JUST FROM JEEZ, THIS ISNT FUNNY TO FUCK YOU! YEAH, THERE ARE SOME VEGAN RESTAURANTSTHAT SERVERAW FOOD, BUT IM PRETTY SURE THEY DONT SERVE YOU UNCOOKED BREAD, YOU ASSHOLES. WHAT, DID YOU JUST GET FINISHED WATCHING THAT RACIST DINNER SCENE FROMINDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM? FUCK YOU, MOVIE. FUCK. YOU. IN CASE ITS NOT CLEAR, I DIDNT LIKE THIS MOVIE. IT DIDNT LET BRILLIANT ACTORS DO WHAT THEY DO BEST (POEHLER, FEY AND ROMANY MALCO ARESEVERELYHANDCUFFED) AND IT JUST KINDA WAFFLES AROUND AS YOU WAIT FOR ITS INEVITABLE (AND STUPID) CONCLUSION. I CANT RECOMMEND THIS FLICK A COMEDY, A CHICK FLICK OR FOR EVEN COMPLETISTS WHO LOVES THESE PERFORMERS. IT JUST SUCKS.

475	SOME OF THE MISTAKES WE MAKE DURING OUR LIFETIME HELP US TO BECOME BETTER PEOPLE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, OTHERS MAY HAVE A DEVASTATING EFFECT ON OUR LIFE AND CAREER. ONE OF SUCH MISTAKES IS CHOOSING TO DRINK AND DRIVE. IF YOU GET CAUGHT BY THE POLICE OR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS, YOU COULD BE CHARGED FOR VIOLATING DUI LAW AND THIS WILL HAVE A TERRIBLE EFFECT ON YOUR JOB. HERE ARE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAT DRUNK DRIVING WILL HAVE ON YOUR CAREER. LIMITED TRANSPORT OPTIONS YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE WILL MOST LIKELY BE SUSPENDED IF YOU ARE CAUGHT DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL. THIS MEANS YOUR MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION WILL BE LIMITED TO TAKING A BUS, A TAXI OR HIRING SOMEONE TO DRIVE YOU. DUE TO THE UNRELIABLE NATURE OF SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVES TO DRIVING YOURSELF, YOUR PUNCTUALITY AND EFFICIENCY ON THE JOB WILL BE AFFECTED. IF YOU ARE REQUIRED TO DRIVE, BY YOUR EMPLOYER, YOU COULD END UP LOSING YOUR JOB. TERMINATION OF APPOINTMENT SOME EMPLOYERS HAVE STRICT EMPLOYMENT GUIDELINES THAT STATE THAT IF YOU ARE CONVICTED FOR DUI, YOU WILL BE FIRED AUTOMATICALLY. COVERING UP THE OFFENCE WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE YOUR EMPLOYER WILL EVENTUALLY FIND OUT.

476	THAT GAME YOU USED TO PLAY IS GETTING A FULL-LENGTH FEATURE AND THE TRAILER GIVES US A FIRST LOOK AT FAVOURITE CHARACTERS LIKE NAMELESS RED BIRD AND BLACK BLOWY-UP BIRD ANGRY BIRDS IS THE RED-HOT IPHONE APP OF THE MOMENT. ITS LITERALLY A ONE-IN-A-MILLION SENSATION. YOUR FRIENDS CANT STOP PLAYING IT.  IS ANOTHER BULL AS THE ACTIVE INVESTMENT MANAGER WHO IS HAVING 44,043 SHARES OF DOMINION RESOURCES INC OR 7.94% OF THEIR PORTFOLIO. THE WORLDS EDGIEST COMEDIANS CANT STOP REFERENCING IT AND NOW ITS HEADING TO THE BIG SCREEN! WHAT SORT OF BLOCKBUS OH, HANG ON, MY FAULT, SORRY. I THOUGHT IT WAS 2012. LET ME START AGAIN. ANGRY BIRDS IS THAT IPHONE GAME THAT PEOPLE USED TO PLAY A LOT THREE YEARS AGO BUT DONT ANY MORE. AND NOW ITS GOING TO BE A FILM. AND THERES A TRAILER FOR IT. THERE, THATS BETTER. STILL, WHILE WERE HERE, LETS GIVE THE ANGRY BIRDS TRAILER A CLOSER LOOK. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST WE OPEN WITH A SHOT OF THE CHARACTER WERE MOST LIKELY TO REMEMBER FROM THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED ANGRY BIRDS SEVERAL YEARS AGO NAMELESS RED BIRD. HERES NAMELESS RED BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. SO FAR, THIS IS A FILM ABOUT A CARTOON BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST ALSO PRESENT, THREE SEXY BIRDS. AT LEAST I ASSUME THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY. GOD, I HOPE THEY ARE, OTHERWISE IVE JUST PROJECTING A HORRIFIC AMOUNT OF SEXUAL AVAILABILITY ONTO THREE RELATIVELY GENDER-FREE ARTOON BIRDS. NOT THIS WEEK, HERITAGE. DONT DO THIS WHILE NEBULOUS ALMOST-BESTIALITY IS SUCH A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE. GET IT TOGETHER.  AND THEY WERE AIMING ALL THEIR RED-HOT SEXUALITY AT THAT HUNKY SORT-OF BLUEISH BIRD. I HOPE THE RED BIRDS OK, AND DIDNT MISTAKENLY THINK THE OTHER BIRDS WERE ACTUALLY COMING ON TO HIM. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST AH. HE DID. AND BY THE LOOK OF IT HE HASNT TAKEN THE REJECTION WELL. IN FACT, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT HES NOW A FAIRLY ANGRY BIRD. SEE WHAT I DID THERE? THAT WAS CLEVER OF ME WASNT IT? SO ANGRY IS NAMELESS RED BIRD, IN FACT, THAT HE APPEARS TO HAVE ENROLLED IN SOME SORT OF ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME, ALONG WITH AN ANNOYING YELLOW BIRD PLAYED BY THE ANNOYING MAN WHO PLAYED THE ANNOYING SNOWMAN IN FROZEN.  IVE KILLED ENOUGH PEOPLE FOR ONE LIFETIME. TYPECASTING ISSUES ASIDE, THOUGH, THIS LITERALLY SEEMS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE A FILM ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. THATS LITERALLY WHAT THIS FILM IS. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR THE BLACK BLOWY-UP UP BIRD IS ALSO ANGRY, BECAUSE HES JUST BLOWN UP. WOW, THESE PEOPLE HAVE REALLY GRABBED THE WHOLE ANGRY BIRDS IDEA BY ITS MOST LITERAL END AND RUN WITH IT, HAVENT THEY?

BUT THE REALLY GOOD NEWS IS THAT DXO ONE ALSO AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERS A JPG OF THE IMAGE TO YOUR IPHONES CAMERA ROLL SO YOU CAN SHARE HIGHER-QUALITY 20 MP IMAGES ON YOUR SOCIAL NETWRKS ALMOST INSTANTLY. PRETTY SOON THESE PIGS WILL BE CONSTRUCTING DANGEROUSLY RAMSHACKLE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES, AND THE BIRDS WILL KAMIKAZE INTO THEM AS REVENGE. IF MY MEMORY IS CORRECT, THE BIRDS ALL DIE AS SOON AS THEYVE BEEN CATAPULTED AT THE PIGS, WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE WILL ACTUALLY TURN UP TO BE A SORROWFUL MEDITATION ON THE FUTILITY OF WAR. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, WRONG AGAIN. ITS JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE IS LITERALLY JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME BIRDS WHO GET ANGRY SOMETIMES. HOPEFULLY CLEAR FLAWS WILL ALL BE ADDRESSED ADDRESSED AND IRONED OUT BY THE TIME THEY MAKE A FILM ABOUT YOUR SECOND-FAVOURITE IPHONE APP, GOOGLE MAPS.
477	UPDATE. MIKE BAIRD: BACHELOR FAN. PHOTO: JESSICA HROMAS WE ALL EXPECTED SOMEAMUSING TWEETS DURING LAST NIGHT'SFINAL EPISODE OF THE BACHELOR AU , BUT I DOUBT ANY OF US EXPECTED MOST OF THOSE AMUSING TWEETS TO COME FROM NSW PREMIER MIKE BAIRD.

JUST AS THE SEASON FINALE WAS GETTING UNDERWAY, BAIRD TWEETEDTHAT HE WA STUCK AT HOME "WITH THE MAN-FLU", AND THAT HIS DAUGHTERS HAD COMANDEERED THE TV TO FIND OUT WHETHER BACHIE SAM WOULD GIVE HIS FINAL ROSE TOSNEZANA OR LANA. BACHELOR SAM WOOD AND NEW LOVE, SNEZANA MARKOSKI.  WHEN ONE NOTES THAT THE PRICE OF A HOTEL ROOM IN NAIROBI IS ALMOST DOUBLE THAT IN JOBERG AND THE ROOM RATE IN ADDIS IS 60% MORE EXPENSIVE THAN NAIROBI, ONE IS TEMPTED TO ASK HOW PRICES CAN BE SO DIFFERENT. PHOTO: CHANNEL TEN "IT'S GOING TO BE A LOOOONG NIGHT," HE WROTE. STUCK AT HOME ON THE COUCH WITH MAN-FLU. DAUGHTERS HAVE HIJACED THE TV AND ARE WATCHING THEBACHELOR. GOING TO BE A LOOOONG NIGHT.

AND SO HE DID, IN AN EPIC ONE-AND-A-HALF HOUR TWEETING SERSSION, FILLED WITH BEMUSED HILARITY, FATHERLY ADVICE, THE REVELATION THAT HIS DEPUTY GLADYS BEREJIKLIAN WAS A LONGTIME FAN, AND A FEW CRUEL DIGS AT HOST OSHER GUNSBERG'S HAIR. AS THE INTERNET SAID, SNEZ MAY HAVE WON THE BACHELOR'S HEART, BUT MIKE BAIRD WON THE BACHELOR FINALE. HE SEEMS VERY SINCERE FOR A GUY WHO IS TWO-TIMING, LIVE ON TV.

479	PROVERBS TEACH WISDOM FOR THE MOST PART, THESE PROVERBS, KNOWN AS WISDOM LITERATURE, ARE A COLLECTION WRITTEN BY KING SOLOMON, DAVIDS SON, TO WHOM GOD GAVE GREAT WISDOM. 1 KINGS 4:32 ATTRIBUTES OVER 3000 PROVERBS TO KING SOLOMON. THE PROVERBS FOCUS ON WISDOM AS APPLIED TO ALMOST EVERY FACET OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIP. THERE ARE FREQUENT USES OF METAPHORS, SIMILES, AND FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE AMONG THE VARIOUS PROVERBS. CONTRASTS AND COMPARISONS ARE ALSO COMMON. 1:2-4 THEIR PURPOSE IS TO TEACH PEOPLE WISDOM AND DISCIPLINE,TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE INSIGHTS OF THE WISETO TEACH PEOPLE TO LIVE DISCIPLINED AND SUCCESSFUL LIVES,TO HELP THEM DO WHAT IS RIGHT, JUST, AND FAIR. THESE PROVERBS WILL GIVE INSIGHT TO THE SIMPLE, KNOWLEDGE AND DISCERNMENT TO THE YOUNG. THE WISE BECOME WISER AND THOSE WITH UNDERSTANDING ARE GIVEN GUIDANCE. 1:7 FEAR OF THE LORD IS THE FOUNDATION OF TRUE KNOWLEDGE, BUT FOOLS DESPISE WISDOM AND DISCIPLINE. TRUE KNOWLEDGE BEGINS WITH A REVERENT RESPECT FOR THE LORD. THE WORD FOOL REFERS TO A PERSON WHO IS ARROGANT AND SELF-SUFFICIENT, THINKING AND BEHAVING AS IF THERE IS NO GOD. 1:20WISDOM SHOUTS IN THE STREETS. 1:23COME AND LISTEN TO MY COUNSEL.ILL SHARE MY HEART WITH YOU AND MAKE YOU WISE. 1:32-33FOR SIMPLETONS TURN AWAY FROM METO DEATH.FOOLS ARE DESTROYED BY THEIR OWN COMPLACENCY. BUT ALL WHO LISTEN TO ME WILL LIVE IN PEACE,UNTROUBLED BY FEAR OF HARM. THE BENEFIT OF WISDOM IS WE LEARN WHAT IT MEANS TO FEAR THE LORD. 2:2-4 TUNE YOUR EARS TO WISDOM, AND CONCENTRATE ON UNDERSTANDING. CRY OUT FOR INSIGHT,AND ASK FOR UNDERSTANDING.SEARCH FOR THEM AS YOU WOULD FOR SILVER;SEEK THEM LIKE HIDDEN TREASURES. 2:6-8FOR THE LORD GRANTS WISDOM! FROM HIS MOUTH COME KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING.HE GRANTS A TREASURE OF COMMON SENSE TO THE HONEST.HE IS A SHIELD TO THOSE WHO WALK WITH INTEGRITY. HE GUARDS THE PATHS OF THE JUSTAND PROTECTS THOSE WHO ARE FAITHFUL TO HIM. 2:9-11 YOU WILL FIND THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. WISE CHOICES WILL WATCH OVER YOU. UNDERSTANDING WILL KEEP YOU SAFE. 2:12 WISDOM WILL SAVE YOU FROM EVIL PEOPLE 2:16 WISDOM WILL SAVE YOU FROM THE IMMORAL WOMAN. 2:20-22 FOLLOW THE STEPS OF GOOD MEN. FOR ONLY THE GODLY WILL LIVE IN THE LAND, AND THOSE WITH INTEGRITY WILL REMAIN IN IT. BUT THE WICKED WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE LAND,AND THE TREACHEROUS WILL BE UPROOTED. THE PURPOSE OF THE PROVERBS IS TO PROVIDE WISDOM, WHICH LEADS TO GOOD CHOICES AND A LIFE OF INTEGRITY. PAUL ENCOURAGES GIVING PAUL BRIEFLY ADDRESSES THE TOPIC OF GIVING AS FUNDS WERE BEING COLLECTED FOR THOSE IN NEED IN JERUSALEM. THE TIME AND FREQUENCY FOR GIVING: 16:2 ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH WEEK YOU SHOULD EACH PUT ASIDE A PORTION OF THE MONEY YOU HAVE EARNED. GIVING IS TO BE DONE IN A PURPOSEFUL AND THOUGHTFUL MANNER, ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT GOD HAS PROSPERED EACH INDIVIDUAL. AS PAUL CLOSES THIS LETTER TO THE CORINTHIAN CHURCH HE MENTIONS HIS CURRENT AND FUTURE PLANS, WHILE MAKING NOTE OF FELLOW BELIEVERS WHO SERVE WITH DEVOTION. HE THEN GIVES HIS FINAL ADMONITION: 16:13-14BE ON GUARD. STAND FIRM IN THE FAITH. BE COURAGEOUS. BE STRONG. AND DO EVERYTHING WITH LOVE. THEN PAUL PRONOUNCES A WARNING WITH HIS FINAL BENEDICTION: 16:22-24IF ANYONE DOES NOT LOVE THE LORD, THAT PERSON IS CURSED. OUR LORD, COME!MAY THE GRACE OF THE LORD JESUS BE WITH YOU.MY LOVE TO ALL OF YOU IN CHRIST JESUS. O LORD, WE COME TO YOU IN REVERENT AWE AND RESPECT, DESIRING TO LISTEN TO YOUR COUNSEL. AS WE LIVE WITH AN ATTITUDE OF REVERENT AWE FOR YOU MAY WE BECOME WISE IN EVERY FACET OF OUR LIVES. SHARE YOUR HEART WITH US SO WE MAY MAKE GOOD CHOICES AND LIVE LIVES OF INTEGRITY. INCREASE OUR WISDOM SO WE MAY DO THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE RIGHT, JUST AND FAIR. WE WANT YOUR INSIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING, AND THANK YOU FOR GUARDING OUR PATH AND PROTECTING US.YOU ARE OUR SHIELD AND PROTECTOR. WE PLACE OUR TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN YOU ALONE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PROVISION TO US EACH WEEK. MAY WE BE FAITHFUL AND EAGER TO SHARE WITH THOSE IN NEED AS YOU HAVE PROVIDED FOR EACH OF US.

482	IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT I GO INTO A FILM WITH NO EXPECTATIONS. I ALWAYS END UP SEEING A TRAILER AND READING REVIEWS THAT CAN CLOUD MY JUDGEMENT ON A FILM. SOMETIMES MY EXPECTATIONS ARE TOO HIGH AND I END UP REALLY DISAPPOINTED, OTHER TIMES I'M SURPRISED WHEN A FILM I HAD LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR TURNS OUT TO BE AMAZING. ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL IS ONE WHERE I HAD NO PRECONCEPTIONS. I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THE TRAILERS AND I READ AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REVIEWS, GIVING ME A NEUTRAL IMAGE OF THE FILM AND NO EXPECTATIONS FOR THE QUALITY, AND I THINK IT'S BEST THAT I WENT IN LIKE THAT. HAVING NO EXPECTATIONS OPENED ME UP TO BE INCREDIBLY SURPRISED BY THE FILM MOVED BY IT'S STORY. THE PLOT REVOLVES AROUND GREG, A SOCIALLY AWKWARD TEENAGER IN HIS  FINAL YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO HAS NO REAL PLANS FOR THE FUTURE AND BELIEVES THE BEST WAY TO REMAIN INVISIBLE IS TO HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT, RETAIN JUST ENOUGH OF A CONNECTION TO ALL THE HIGH SCHOOL SOCIAL CIRCLES SO THAT HE'S BOTH IN AND OUT OF ALL OF THEM. PERSON HE HAS A CONNECTION TO IS EARL, WHO GREG CONSIDERS TO BE A CO-WORKER DUE TO THEM MAKING, BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION, TERRIBLE FILM PARODIES. THIS CHANGES WHEN GREG'S MUM FORCES HIM TO SPEND TIME WITH RACHEL, A GIRL LIVING NEAR HIM WHO HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKIMIA AND OVER TIME, A FRIENDSHIP DEVELOPS BETWEEN THE TWO. NORMALLY, THIS TYPE OF FILM WOULD INFURIATE ME, IT HAS ALL THE MAKINGS OF AN OVERLY SENTIMENTAL LOVE STORY IN THE VEIN OF THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, BUT HERE IT WORKS AND FOR ONE KEY REASON: IT'S NOT A LOVE STORY. THROUGHOUT THE FILM, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF ANY ROMANTIC ATTRACTION BETWEEN GREG AND RACHEL, IT'S ALL FRIENDSHIP. IT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF JUST HAVINGX SOMEONE TO TALK TO DURING THESE EVENTS AND THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN GREG AND RACHEL IS REALLY NATURAL, AS AS THE TWO WERE FORCED INTO IT, THE ACTUAL FEEL FORCED IN THE SLIGHTEST. IT ALSO DOES A GOOD JOB AT EXPOSING THE SELFISH ATTITUDES OF SOMEONE LIKE GREG. IT'S CLEAR THAT HE AMBITIONS AND IN TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYONE TO REMAIN INVISIBLE, HE HAS NO REAL CONNECTION TO ANYONE, HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE TRUE DETAILS OF PEOPLE, A POINT WHICH COMES ACROSS REALLY WELL IN A CONVERSATION HE HAS WITH HIS HISTORY TEACHER AND THE FINAL SCENE OF THE FILM. IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT, WITHOUT THE INFLUENCE OF RACHEL, AND BY PARENTS, HE WOULD HAVE NO FUTURE. GREG MAKES IT CLEAR THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO UNIVERSITY BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE HE WOULDN'T FIT IN, AND VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER CHARACTER  IN THE FILM CALLS GREG OUT ON THIS ATTITUDE, ESPECIALLY RACHEL WHO FORCES HIMO TO APPLY. WE SEE THAT GREG DOES HAVE TALENT AND SOME FORM OF DRIVE BUT HIS OWN SELFISH ATTITUDES ARE HOLDING HIM BACK, HE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND EMPATHY ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW SELFISH HE'S BEING.  WE COULD SEE THE OCEAN LOOKS ANGRY, THE CURRENTS PUSHING EVERY WHICH WAY. THIS IS ALSO A GOOD TIME TO BRING IN EARL. THE FILM MAKES IT CLEAR THAT EARL HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET GREG TO OPEN UP, MAINLY SO GREG CAN ACCEPT HIM AS A FRIEND. ALL OF THE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR GREG TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON HINGE ON EARL GETTING GREG TO ADMIT HIS TALENTS TO PEOPLE, MAINLY WHEN EARL FIRST TELLS RACHEL ABOUT GREG'S FILMMAKING WHEN GREG REJECTS THESE EFFORTS TO MAKE HIM BETTER EARL CUTS OFF TIES WITH HIM, BUT AS THE FILM GOES ON, WE SEE THAT EARL IS A TRUE FRIEND TO GREG, UNAFRAID TO DEFEND HIM FROM ATTACKS BUT WILLINYG TO CALL GREG OUT FOR HIS SELFISH ATTITUDES. THE WHOLE FILM IS ABOUT GETTING GREG TO APPRECIATE HIS TALENTS, LOSE HIS SELFISHNESS AND UNDERSTAND LIFE BETTER AND, FOR SOMEONE AS ISOLATED AND SELFISH AS GREG, IT COULD ONLY BCE THROUGH AN EXPERIENCE WITH DEATH.  "HE KEPT FIGHTING UNTIL THE DAY HE PASSED AWAY. THAT BEING SAID, NOT ALL OF THE PLOT ELEMENTS WORK. THERE ARE A FEW CHARACTERS THAT DON'T REALLY WORK IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS AND PLOT POINTS THAT DON'T FULLY RESOLVED. THESE ARE MOMENTS THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE WORKED BETTER ON THE PAGE THAN ON THE SCREEN. INDIVIDUALLY, THESE CREATE SOME GOOD LAUGHS AND SOME GOOD CHARACTER MOMENTS, BUT A WHOLE, THEY DON'T REALLY ADD TOD THE FILM EXPERIENCE. THE CAST MEANWHILE REALLY SELL THE NATURE OF THE PLOT. I'VE SAID ALL I NEED TO ABOUT GREG PREVIOUSLY SO I WON'T REPEAT MYSELF HERE, SUFFICE IT TO SAY, THOMAS MANN DOES A GREAT JOB SELLING BOTH THE SELFISH NATURE OF THE CHARACTER AND THE EVENTUAL REFORM OF THE CHARACTER AND UNDERSTANDING HOW TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON.  SHE BRILLIANTLY SHOWS THE PAIN THAT A DISEASE LIKE LEUKEMIA CAN CAUSE AND THE NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE JUST TALK TO YOU AND MAKE YOU LAUGH, WITH THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN HER AND MANN NAILING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS. WHEN THINGS START TO GOK DOWNHILL FOR RACHEL IN TERMS OF HER TREATMENT, COOKE BRILLIANTLY SHOWS THE PAIN THAT THE DISEASE IS GIVING HER AND WE SEE HER WILL TO LIVE START TO DECLINE AND IN THESE SCENES, COOKE'S PERFORMANCE IS INCREDIBLE, SHOWING HOW DIFFICULT HER DECISIONS HAVE BEEN TO MAKE AND I INCREDIBLY CLOASE TO CRYING DURING THESE SCENES (WHICH IS RLARE FOR ME, THE ONLY FILMS I'VE SEEN THAT HAVE ACTIVELY LED TO ME CRYING ARE THE ELEPHANT MAN, WALL-E AND UP). RJ CYLER MEANWHILE DOES A GREAT JOB AS EARL, HIS MORE OPTIMISTIC ATTITUDE BEING A GREAT COUNTERPOINT FOR GREG AND IT'S CLEAR THAT, WITIHOUT EARL, GREG WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND HIGH SCHOOL. THERE'S A BIT OF A HERZOG-KINSKI PARALLEL BETWEEN GREG AND EARL THAT THE FILM MAKES CLEAR, WITH EARL WANTING TO GET GREG TO EXPRESS HIMSELF AND GREG BEING A SELFISH, EGOMANIAC WHO DOESN'T WANT TO AND HAS TO BE THERE'S ALSO A GOOD PERFORMANCE FROM KATHERINE HUGHES AS MADISON, A CLASSMATE OF GREG'S AND ANOTHER PERSON WHO TRIES TO GET GREG TO OPEN UP TO RACHEL THROUGH HIS FILMS, MAINLY BE ENCOURAGING GREG MAKE A FILM FOR RACHEL, AND IT'S CLEAR THAT SHE HAS SYMPATHY FOR RACHEL'S SITUATION AND SYORT OF UNDERSTANDS GREG AND DOES WHAT SHE FEEL IS BEST FOR BOTH OF THEM AND, AGAIN, IT'S GREAT THAT THE CHARACTER DOESN'T BECOME A LOVE INTEREST. THERE'S GREAT COMIC RELIEF FROM NICK OFFERMAN AS GREG'S DAD, ADDING HIS REALLY DRY COMEDIC STYLE TO THE FILM AS A PRETENTIOUS SOCIOLOGY WRITER, JON BERNTHAL, WHO'S A LOT OF FUN AS GREG'S HISTORY TEACHER, HAVING SOME OF THE BEST LAUGHS IN THE FILM, ALONG WITH A REALLY GREAT DRAMATIC MOMENT. MOLLY SHANNON AS RACHEL'S MUM IS ALSO WORTHY OF MENTION AS SHE BRILLIANTLY SHOWS HOW SOMEONE WOULD REACT TO THEIR KID GETTING DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKEMIA AND DIFFICULTY SHE HAS IN ACCEPTING WHAT IS HAPPENING TO RACHEL. THERE'S ALSO A FUN LITTLE CAMEO FROM HUGH JACKMAN THAT PROVIDES A GREAT LAUGH. ON A TECHNICAL SIDE, THE FILM IS QUITE CLEARLY EMULATE THE FILMS OF WES ANDERSON, START AT LEAST.  SPECIAL MENTION IN THE TECHNICALS HAS TO GO TO THE FILM PARODIES THEMSELVES. THE OF THEM ALONE WERE ENOUGH TO GET A LAUGH OUT OF ME AND THE PRODUCTION ELEMENTS IN EACH OF THESE FILMS DOES ENOUGH WORK TO RECREATE STYLE OF THE ORIGINAL FILMS WHILST PUTTING THEIR OWN SPIN ON IT, SPECIAL MENTION GOING TO A SOCKWORK ORANGE. AS SAID BEFORE, THERE IS A BIT OF HERZOG AND KINSKI IN THE CHARACTERS OF GREG AND EARL AND THIS ACROSS IN THE STYLE THE FILM AS WELL,  WITH THERE BEING A CLEAR INFLUENCE OF HERZOG THE DIRECTION AND CINEMATOGRAPHY THAT'S SUBTLE ENOUGH WHERE YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE IT UNLESS YOU KNOW FILMS OF HERZOG. THE MUSIC BY BRIAN ENO MEANWHILE IS GREAT AT SETTING THE TONE FOR THE FILM, WORKING ESPECIALLY WELL AT THE END OF THE FILM AND BEING ONE OF THE MAIN ELEMENTS THAT CREATED SUCH A STRONG EMOTIONAL REACTION FROM ME. OVERALL, THIS IS A FILM I HAD NO EXPECTATIONS FOR GOING IN AND ENDED UP LOVING. FILMS LIKE THIS NORMALLY INFURIATE ME BUT WHEN THEY'RE DONE RIGHT, THEY CAN CREATE GREAT CHARACTERS, MEMORABLE MOMENTS AND BRILLIANT STORIES. THIS IS ANOTHER CASE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER FOR ME, AND IN MANY WAYS THIS FILM WORKS AS A BIT OF A COMPANION PIECE TO THAT ONE, SHOWING THE IMPORTANCE OF FRIENDSHIP IN THE HARDEST TIME OF A PERSONS LIFE AND I HAVE NO RESERVATIONS IN RECOMMENDING THIS FILM. MY RATING: 5/5

484	INDIA'S FINANCE MINISTER ARUN JAITLEY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL NO LONGER ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE A RETROSPECTIVE MINIMUM ALTERNATE TAX (MAT) ON OVERSEAS INVESTORS. MAT IS IN EFFECT A BASELINE TAX ON COMPANIES THAT OPERATE IN INDIA BUT PAY LITTLE OR NO CORPORATION TAX. IT IS IMPOSED AT 18.5 PER CENT OF PROFITS, ORIGINALLY ONLY ON FIRMS WITH A PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT IN INDIA. BUT IN 2012, THE INDIAN REVENUE AGENCY DECIDED IT WAS ALSO APPLICABLE TO FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT EARN INCOME OR CAPITAL GAINS IN INDIA. ITS DECISION WAS LATER UPHELD IN COURT, AND IN LATE 2014 THE AGENCY BEGAN SENDING OUT LARGE RETROSPECTIVE MAT ASSESSMENTS TO FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. THIS ACTION, DENOUNCED BY INVESTORS AS 'TAX TERRORISM', CAUSED SIGNIFICANT STOCK MARKET INSTABILITY. IT ALSO DREW LITIGATION FROM THE TARGET COMPANIES NOTABLY MAURITIUS-BASED CASTLETON INVESTMENT WHO CHALLENGED THE RETROSPECTIVE NATURE OF THE TAX CHARGES ON THEIR CAPITAL GAINS. INDIA'S SUPREME COURT WAS DUE TO RULE ON THESE CHALLENGES LATER THIS MONTH. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, THE GOVERNMENT HAD SET UP A SPECIAL PANEL, HEADED BY A P SHAH, CHAIRMAN OF INDIA'S LAW COMMISSION, TO DECIDE WHETHER MAT OUGHT TO BE CHARGED RETROSPECTIVELY ON FOREIGN INVESTORS' CAPITAL GAINS. JAITLEY HAS NOW ANNOUNCED THAT THE SHAH COMMISSION ADVISED THAT IT SHOULD NOT, AND THAT HE HAS ACCEPTED THAT RECOMMENDATION. THE INCOME TAX ACT WILL BE AMENDED ACCORDINGLY IN THE WINTER PARLIAMENTARY SESSION. MEANWHILE A NOTICE IS TO BE CIRCULATED ORDERING TAX OFFICERS NOT TO ISSUE ANY MORE MAT CLAIMS. JAITLEY HAD ALREADY CONCEDED IN THIS YEAR'S FINANCE BILL THAT MAT WILL NOT BE CHARGED ON FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTORS' GAINS IN 2015-16 AND FUTURE TAX YEARS. THE ANNOUNCEMENT RENDERS THE SUPREME COURT LITIGATION ACADEMIC, AND FOREIGN INVESTORS ARE NOW EXPECTED TO WITHDRAW THEIR WRITS. 'THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE SHAH COMMITTEE REPORT BY THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE VIEWED VERY POSITIVELY BY THE FOREIGN INVESTOR COMMUNITY' COMMENTED RAJESH GANDHI OF TAX CONSULTANTS DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS.

485	KR: RIGHT, THE FETUS CONSTANTLY ADAPTS TO THE WOMB ENVIRONMENT AND PAYS THE PRICE FOR IT. THE FIRST ORDER IS SURVIVE AT ALL COSTS. THEN IF WERE FORTUNATE LATER, POSSIBLY THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO GO BACK AND TAKE CARE OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS, AND ALSO ITS THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO. NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL THEIR PAIN, NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL TERROR OR ANYTHING UNPLEASANT REALLY. THATS WHAT OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE ABOUT, DISTRACTING OURSELVES IN A THOUSAND WAYS FROM ALL THIS PAIN WERE CARRYING AROUND, WHICH KEEPS RELENTLESSLY SURGING TO BE MADE CONSCIOUS. DR. JANOV WRITES, THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA WHILE BEING CARRIED AND IN CHILDHOOD DIE IN AVERAGE TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THOSE RISK FACTORS. SO HERE THIS IS A GOOD ARGUMENT, FOR UNDERSTANDING AND RELIVING AND FEELING OUR PAIN, AND POSSIBLY EVEN HEALING BIG SECTIONS OF OUR HEARTS AND SOULS THAT ARE THERE WAS AN OLD BOOK THAT HE WROTE CALLED PRISONERS OF PAIN. THAT WERE ALL KIND OF HUGGED TIED BY OUR PAIN AND THE REPRESSION THAT WE USE TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT. JL: RIGHT, AND I THINK THIS CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF AFFECTS TOO IN TERMS OF HOW WE REPRESS OR HOW WE TRY TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE JUST AS BAD IF WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DIG PAST THE PAIN OR REPRESS IT THAT CREATES ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM, WHICH CAN THEN SHOW UP IN OTHER WAYS. THERE HASNT BEEN A LOT OF DEFINITIVE RESEARCH ON THIS, BUT DR. JANOV REALLY BELIEVES THAT THIS ALSO MAY WHAT EVENTUALLY CAUSES CANCER, THIS SORT OF MASSIVE REPRESSION ON THE CELLULAR LEVEL THAT PREVENTS NATURAL GROWTH AND THEN OVERTIME CREATES CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES. KR: ID LIKE TO READ ANOTHER SHORT SECTION HERE, DR. JANOV WRITES, WHAT MOST OF MEDICINE AND PSYCHOTHERAPY INVOLVES TODAY IS THE TREATMENT OF FRAGMENTS OF THE HUMAN BEING. WE THEN GO ABOUT TREATING THE VARIED OFFSHOOTS FROM A CENTRAL IMPRINT, RATHER THAN THE IMPRINT ITSELF. TREATMENT BECOMES INTERMINABLE, WHAT WE GET IS A FRAGMENT OF PROGRESS, A CHANGE IN ASPECTS OF AN EARLY EXPERIENCE, RATHER THAN A HOLISTIC RECALIBRATION OR NEURO AND PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS CONNECTED WITH THE EXPERIENCE. JL: RIGHT. I THINK THATS REALLY TO KIND OF TAKE THAT AND KIND OF GO TIED IN WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYING COMPARISONS HE DRAWS IN THE BOOK TO SOMEBODY LIKE FREUD, THE RELATIONSHIP HE HAS WITH SOME OF THE EARLIER SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT PRECEDED HIM IS COMPLICATED. FREUD HE HAD THIS NOTION THAT HYSTERIA WAS ROOTED IN REPRESSED SEXUAL DESIRE AND HE OFTEN CHARTED IT IN DREAMS AND SORT OF THIS SYMBOLIC NOTION OF DREAMS. I THINK WHAT JANOV REALLY DOES IS HE TAKES, MUCH LIKE THOSE I THINK, THINKERS WHO DWELLED IN BIG IDEAS AND SORT OF PROFOUND CONCLUSIONS, HE SORT OF NOTES THAT WHILE FREUD WAS WORKING ON THE SYMBOLIC LABELS AND MISSED A LOT, HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS. INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOW THIS HYSTERIA WOULD CONSTANTLY BE UNREFLECTIVE AND PRONE TO OVERREACTION, AND JANOV WOULD SAY THAT YES THESE TRAITS EXIST, BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR SYMBOLS IN DREAMS, HELL LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF WHATS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN WERE HAVING NIGHTMARES. WHATS HAPPENING TO US BIOLOGICALLY WHEN WE HAVE A NIGHTMARE, OR WHAT DO WE FEEL DURING THAT TIME, AND WHY IS THAT TERROR COMING UP. HELL LOOK TO THE LIMBIC SYSTEM TO FIND WHERE THE TERROR IS ACTUALLY ROOTED. HES NOT TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THATS GOING TO CALM DOWN A PATIENT WHO HAS ADD OR DEPRESSION FOR THE DAY OR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. EVEN SOMETHING THAT MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO, HES REALLY LOOKING TO SOMETHING THAT CAN EVENTUALLY PROMOTE A CURE. KR: IM GOING TO READ ONE MORE PARAGRAPH OK? ON MY END DR. JANOV WRITES, THE BRAIN WE NEED TO ADDRESS DOESNT TALK, DOESNT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT DOESNT UNDERSTAND WORDS. IN FACT, THE TERM UNDERSTAND IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER, WE ARE NOT AFTER UNDERSTANDING IN THE INTELLECTUAL SENSE OF THE TERM, WE ARE AFTER INTEGRATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT CEREBRAL UNDERSTANDING.  WHEN A THERAPIST TRIES TO GET A PATIENT TO REPORT ON HIS FEELINGS ALL MAY BE LOST, FOR THOSE FEELINGS MAY BE WORDLESS. TRYING TO EXPRESS THEM VERBALLY DISTANCES US FROM THE ORIGINS OF OUR PAIN IN THE LOWER BRAIN, AND SINCE ONE LAYER OF BRAIN TISSUE CANNOT DO THE WORK OF ANOTHER WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY TRUMPED OR EFFORTS, ONCE WE GET AWAY FROM WORDS WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT IS CURATIVE. UNDERSTANDING CAME LAST IN HUMAN EVOLUTION, LONG AFTER FEELING, AND IT WILL NOT LEAD US TO THE LONG TERM HEALING WE ARE AFTER. NONE OF THIS REQUIRES ABSTRACT OR ESOTERIC METHODS, WE CAN MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN SOCIETY JUST BY PAYING ATTENTION TO GESTATION AND CHANGING OUR BIRTH PRACTICES. JL: RIGHT, AND I MEAN I THINK THATS ONE OF THE BOOKS KEY CONCLUSIONS, IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT BIRTH PRACTICES AND LOOK AT A MOTHERS EMOTIONAL STATE AS NOT JUST NOT AT ALL INCIDENTAL.  FOR THEM TO LISTEN TO US, WE HAVE TO FIRST LISTEN TO THEM. I THINK THE IDEA THAT FEELING IS CONNECTED TO OUR BIOLOGY AND HAS THESE SORT OF BIOLOGIC IMPLICATIONS, WE CAN SEE IT IN OUR BIOLOGY IS A PRETTY DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE FIELD. A FIELD THAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY TALK THERAPY AND BY APPROACHES REALLY FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS, NOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN. THATS WHERE I THINK DR. JANOV IS REALLY LOOKING TO GO. KR: WELL, IT EXCITES ME BECAUSE I THINK IT OPENS A HUGE DOOR. I THINK IT OPENS AN ENORMOUS DOOR OF UNDERSTANDING AND OF SUGGESTING VERY FUNDAMENTAL, NONE ESOTERIC, AS HE SAYS, SIMPLE BIRTH PRACTICES, PRACTICES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILD BIRTHING THAT CAN HAVE THE MOST DRAMATIC AND FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR HUMAN FUTURE. IT CAN PROBABLY DO MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE BILLABLE HOURS IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROFESSION. JL: YES, I THINK THERE WAS A CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK THAT CAME ABOUT LATER SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH PREGNANCY, AND I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME WORKING WITH DR. JANOV IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND JUST KIND OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE CONSTANT INFLUX OF NEW IDEAS AND RESEARCH HE WAS EXPOSING ME TO AND ALL THE WORK THAT WAS BEING DONE, IN THE FIELD OF EPIGENETICS AND IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL HEALTH AND NEW STUDIES HE WAS SHOWING ME ABOUT MEMORY AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE OTHER TOPICS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK REALLY STUCK WAS THIS IDEA ABOUT WHAT TO DO DURING PREGNANCY. AND HE ENDED UP SORT OF WRITING A CHAPTER ON PREGNANCY AND JUST OFFERING SOME ALMOST CONCRETE PIECES OF ADVICE FOR WOMEN THAT CAN HAVE SOME REALLY LASTING IMPLICATIONS. AS HE WRITES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OXYMORON FOR ME TO GIVE ADVICE SINCE I AM NOT BY PROFESSION NOR INTENTION AN AFICIONADO OF ADVICE. BUT LET US NOT MINIMIZE WHAT A CARRYING MOTHER CAN DO FOR THE GOOD OR BAD OF HER CHILD. IT IS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THAT HE APPROACHES THE SUBJECT, BECAUSE HE IS MALE AND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT IF YOURE SORT OF PROVIDING SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOW IT BEHAVED. BUT THINGS LIKE WATCHING YOUR STRESS; IF I CAN READ JUST A COUPLE PARTS OF THIS CHAPTER I THINK ITS REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE IS NO WAY TO ELIMINATE STRESS ENTIRELY, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS TO MANAGE IT. DONT PLAN A NEW BUSINESS OR START A SERIES OF COMPLICATED PROJECTS THAT PUT YOU UNDER STRESS WHILE PREGNANT. THE BABY WILL FEEL THIS ANXIETY AND SUFFER. TRY TO WORK OUT PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SPOUSE BEFORE YOU GET PREGNANT.  IT IS CALCULATED THAT ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE FOOD WE CONSUME REQUIRES BEE POLLINATION. ONCE YOU ARE PREGNANT, IT IS LARGELY TOO LATE. THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD NEVER ARGUE OR FIGHT AGAIN; BUT TRY TO RESOLVE THE MORE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES BEFORE YOU INTRODUCE A NEW LIFE ON THIS PLANET. THE BABY DESERVES HIS OR HER BEST CHANCE AT LIFE, AND WHAT YOU DO DURING PREGNANCY TO MANAGE YOUR STRESS IS IMPORTANT, IN THAT REGARD. HE TALKS ABOUT EATING RIGHT AND GETTING PROTEIN, CALCIUM, FOLIC ACID, FIBER. HE TALKS ABOUT BEING VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GOING ABOUT TRANQUILIZERS AND PAINKILLERS TO RELIVE ANXIETY. NEW STUDIES ARE COMING OUT ALL THE TIME ON THIS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NEW STUDIES ON THE USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS, THE USE OF TRANQUILIZERS DURING PREGNANCY, AND WERE STILL KIND OF FIGURING OUT WHAT ALL THIS DOES, ULTIMATELY IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE MOTHER TO KEEP HER EMOTIONS BALANCED BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO SEE WHAT OTHER EFFECTS THIS COULD HAVE DURING GESTATION. I THINK THE MAIN THING HE FOCUSES ON ALL OF THIS IS LOVE. TO TOUCH YOUR BABY EARLY ON, TO BREASTFEED IF YOU CAN, HE SAYS, "READ FRENCH OBSTETRICIAN FREDERIC LEBOYER, WHO POPULARIZED THE PRACTICE OF IMMERSING THE NEWBORN IN A WARM WATER BATH, WITHOUT DRUGS AND WITHOUT BRIGHT LIGHTS. LEBOYER RECOMMENDS THAT THE BABY BE HELD RIGHT AWAY AND FOR A LONG TIME. HE ADVISES AGAINST CUTTING THE UMBILICAL CORD TOO SOON AS THE CHILD'S ATTACHMENT WITH HIS MOTHER IS VITAL AT THE START OF LIFE." "THERE IS NO GREATER ADVICE I CAN GIVE THAN THIS: BE OPEN, EXPRESSIVE, AND FEELING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. A CARING MOTHER GIVES HER BABY THE BEST CHANCE FOR LONG-TERM WELL-BEING. YES, EVEN IF YOU DON'T EAT THOSE CARROTS AND TOMATOES WHEN YOU SHOULD, LOVE WILL HELP. YOUR CHILD IS PART OF YOU AND FEELS WHAT YOU FEEL, EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS IT. ALL I ASK IS AWARENESS. THE RESEARCH IS THERE; WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS ANYMORE." HE'S PUTTING IT OUT THERE, WE HAVE RESEARCH INTO THIS FIELD, WE CAN'T TURN A BLIND EYE TO IT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN.

487	TWENTY-NINE AND A HALF REASONS AUTHOR: DENISE GROVER SWANK SERIES:A ROSE GARDNER MYSTERY (BOOK 2) PUBLICATION:CROOKED LANE BOOKS (SEPTEMBER 15, 2015) DESCRIPTION:WHEN ROSE GARDNER REPORTS FOR JURY DUTY IN DENISE GROVER SWANK'SNEW YORK TIMES AND USA TODAY BESTSELLING SERIES, SHE FIGURES SHE'S LUCKY TO GET OUT OF A MORNING WORKING AT THE DMV. THEN, IN SPITE OF A DISASTROUS ENCOUNTER WITH THE NEW ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, MASON DEVERAUX, SHE'S PICKED AS A JUROR ON A MURDER CASE. AS THE TRIAL PROGRESSES AND WITH THE HELP OF ONE OF HER VISIONS, SHE REALIZES THAT THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY, BUT THERE'S NOT A COTTON PICKING THING SHE CAN DO ABOUT IT. OR IS THERE? AS IF THINGS WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH, ROSE'S OLDER SISTER VIOLET IS GOING THROUGH A MID-LIFE CRISIS. VIOLET INSISTS THAT ROSE STOP SEEING HER SEXY NEW BOYFRIEND, ARKANSAS STATE DETECTIVE JOE SIMMONS, AND DATE OTHER MEN. ROSE IS DONE LETTING PEOPLE BOSS HER AROUND, BUT SHE CAN'T COMMIT TO JOE EITHER. STILL, ROSE ISN'T ABOUT TO LET THE BEST THING IN HER LIFE SLIP AWAY IN THE SECOND IN THIS CHARMING SERIES FROM BESTSELLER DENISE GROVER SWANK. MY THOUGHTS: ROSE GARDNER'S SECOND ADVENTURE IS FILLED WITH AS MUCH MADCAP ACTION AS HER FIRST. THE STORY CENTERS AROUND ROSE BEING CALLED FOR JURY DUTY BUT, THROUGH A SERIES OF ACCIDENTS, FINDS HERSELF IN THE MENS' ROOM WHERE SHE HAS A VISION OF SOMEONE SAYING THAT HE IS GOING TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER. THE NEXT THING ROSE KNOWS SHE IS CHOSEN TO BE ON THE JURY WHERE BRUCE WAYNE DECKER IS ON TRIAL FOR THE MURDER OF FRANK MITCHELL. THIS IS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING BECAUSE ROSE HAD A COUPLE OF RUN-INS WITH THE NEW DISTRICT ATTORNEY MASON DEVEREAUX. THE TRIAL ALSO GOES ALONG JUST THE WAY YOU'D EXPECT FROM ANYTHING ROSE IS INVOLVED IN: FIRST, THE AIR CONDITIONER IN THE COURT HOUSE BREAKS, AND, SECOND, ONE OF THE JURORS BRINGS AN EGG DISH THAT GIVES ALL THE OTHER JURORS WHO EAT IT FOOD POISONING. THESE DELAYS JUST GIVE ROSE A CHANCE TO INVESTIGATE TO FIND THE REAL MURDERER GETTING HERSELF INTO ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE. ROSE IS ALSO FACING SOME BOYFRIEND ISSUES. SHE HAS BEEN DATING JOE SIMMONS FOR A MONTH BUT HE HAS BEEN COMMUTING FROM LITTLE ROCK AND WANTS HER TO QUIT HER JOB AT THE DMV AND MOVE TO LITTLE ROCK TO BE WITH HIM. ROSE IS JUST FINDING HER FEET AFTER YEARS OF ABUSE BY HER MOTHER. SHE WANTS TO TAKE THINGS SLOW AND LEARN WHO SHE IS BEFORE MAKING BIG CHANGES IN HER LIFE. TO ADD TO THE CONFUSION, ROSE'S OLDER SISTER VIOLET IS HAVING TROUBLE WITH HER HUSBAND MIKE. THEY MARRIED YOUNG AND NOW THEY MIGHT BE GROWING APART. VIOLET IS DEALING WITH THE UNCERTAINTY IN HER LIFE BY TRYING TO MICROMANAGE ROSE'S LIFE INCLUDING FINDING HER A MORE ACCEPTABLE BOYFRIEND THAN JOE. THIS LEADS TO A COUPLE OF AWKWARD DINNERS AT VIOLET AND MIKE'S. ONE WHEN VIOLET TRIES TO SET ROSE UP WITH A BLIND DATE AND ONE WHERE ROSE AND JOE ARE TREATED REALLY RUDELY BY VIOLET. AN INTERESTING NEW CHARACTER MAKES AN APPEARANCE IN THIS ONE TOO. WHILE HANGING AROUND THE COURT HOUSE, ROSE MEETS NEELY KATE WHO IS A SMART-TALKING, CONNECTED YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAS ALL SORTS OF INFORMATION AND A PSYCHIC GRANDMOTHER. THE TWO BECOME FAST FRIENDS. THIS WAS A GREAT SECOND EPISODE IN THIS SERIES. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT ADVENTURES ROSE HAS NEXT. FAVORITE QUOTE: THANKFULLY, NEELY KATE DIDN'T NOTICE AND SHE FILLED ME IN ON THE LATEST WEDDING NEWS. HER BRIDESMAIDS' DRESSES HAD ARRIVED THE DAY BEFORE, AND INSTEAD OF TEH SOFT PEACH COLOR SHE HAD ORDERED, THEY WERE TANGERINE. "THAT WON'T BE SO BAD," I SUGGESTED. "TANGERINE'S A PRETTY COLOR." "BRENDA, MY SECOND COUSIN TWICE REMOVED, IS A PLUS-SIZED GIRL AND LOVES TO GO TO THE TANNING SALON AND IS ORANGE." SHE'S GONNA LOOK LIKE A SKITTLE." I GOT THIS BOOK FOR REVIEW FROM THE PUBLISHER.

488	ENGLEWOOD, COLO. (AP) STILL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS AND A RHYTHM ON OFFENSE, PEYTON MANNING AT LEAST FOUND HIS FUNNY BONE. THE BRONCOS PUZZLED PASSER MET THE MEDIA AT HIS LOCKER TUESDAY WITH A CAREFREE SMILE AND BOUNCED BACK FROM AN ICY POST-GAME PERFORMANCE THAT FOLLOWED THE BRONCOS 19-13 VICTORY OVER BALTIMORE, ONE THAT INCLUDED NONE OF THE USUAL OFFENSIVE FIREWORKS. HOUNDED FIRST BY THE BOO-BIRDS WHEN THE BRONCOS RAN JUST ONE RED ZONE PLAY AND THEN BY REPORTERS, MANNING WAS ACERBIC AFTER STRETCHING HIS STREAK TO 21 DRIVES, INCLUDING THE PRESEASON, WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN CELEBRATION. THIS TIME, HE DELIVERED A FEW FUNNY LINES AND DEFLECTED TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS STILL-EVOLVING OFFENSE OF BLENDED CONCEPTS WITH A TOUCH OF HUMOR. ASKED ABOUT LANDING ON THE INJURY REPORT WITH A SORE BACK COURTESY OF ALL THOSE HARD HITS FROM THE RAVENS, MANNING DECIDED TO DELIVER HIS OWN EVALUATION OF THOSE ASKING ALL THE QUESTIONS. THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY GROUP, BY ANY MEANS, MANNING CRACKED. THIS ONE SURELY HAS GOUT. BUNIONS, THAT ONE. CARPEL TUNNEL OVER HERE FROM ALL THE TEXTING OF HIS SOURCES. AND THE DRIVE-TIME RADIO HOST, HES GOT LARYNGITIS FROM RIPPING ME ALL WEEK PLUS THE RASH THAT HE HAS THATS UNIDENTIFIED. BUT I NEVER HEAR YOU GUYS COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, SO IM NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. IN MANY WAYS, YOU GUYS INSPIRE ME, MANNING DEAD-PANNED. BUT, NO, I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED THAT I WAS ON IT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. BUT I THINK LIKE A LOT OF GUYS, IT WAS A PRETTY PHYSICAL GAME ON SUNDAY. AND JUST LIKE THAT, MANNING WENT FROM BEING THE THERMOMETER TO BEING THE THERMOSTAT, SETTING THE TONE FOR THE TEAM INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THE MOOD SURROUNDING IT. I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING OURSELVES AROUND HERE THAT WE DID ACTUALLY WIN THE GAME AND THAT WE ARE 1-0. THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE I CANT IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE HAD WE LOST THE GAME, MANNING SAID. THE OFFENSE, WHICH INCLUDES FOUR NEW LINEMEN, DID DO SOME GOOD THINGS SUNDAY, LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER AN 11-MINUTE FOURTH-QUARTER DRIVE THAT LED TO BRANDON MCMANUSS FOURTH FIELD GOAL. IM SURE OFFENSIVELY I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF GUYS THAT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO PLAY BETTER. I FEEL LIKE THAT THURSDAY PROBABLY COULDNT COME SOON ENOUGH, MANNING SAID. THE BRONCOS PLAY AT KANSAS CITY (1-0), WHERE A VICTORY WOULD GIVE MANNING AND THE BRONCOS A RECORD 13TH CONSECUTIVE DIVISIONAL ROAD WIN. FIRST THINGS FIRST. FINDING THE END ZONE IS PRIORITY NO. 1 FOR A TEAM THAT JUST TWO YEARS AGO BECAME THE FIRST IN NFL HISTORY TO CRACK THE 600-POINT BARRIER WHEN MANNING THREW FOR A RECORD 55 TOUCHDOWNS. SOMETIMES THE BEST MEDICINE IS TO GET BACK OUT THERE AND PLAY AS SOON AS YOU CAN, MANNING SAID. AND, AS HE SHOWED TUESDAY, SOMETIMES LAUGHTERS THE BEST TONIC, TOO. NOTES: ILB BRANDON MARSHALL SAID ONE OF THE SCREWS IN HIS SURGICALLY REPAIRED RIGHT FOOT HAS BROKEN, BUT HELL TRY TO DEAL WITH THE DISCOMFORT UNTIL AFTER THE SEASON BECAUSE SURGERY TO REMOVE IT WOULD REQUIRE A TWO-MONTH RECOVERY. S DARIAN STEWART (GROIN) GOT HURT ON THE PLAY BEFORE HIS GAME-WINNING INTERCEPTION SUNDAY, SOMETHING COACH GARY KUBIAK DIDNT LEARN UNTIL WATCHING CB AQIB TALIB, WHO WAS MICD UP FOR THE GAME, ON THE TEAMS WEBSITE.

489	AHMEDS CLOCK IN THE AGE OF GRIEVANCE-MONGERING A PHONY CASE OF ISLAMOPHOBIA BY KEVIN D. WILLIAMSON POSTED BY RUTH KING ON SEPTEMBER 18TH, 2015 HTTP://WWW.NATIONALREVIEW.COM/ARTICLE/424202/AHMED-MOHAMED-CLOCK AHMED MOHAMED IS A HUMAN RORSCHACH TEST. LOOK AT THAT FACE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE: MUSLIM-AMERICAN? AFRICAN-AMERICAN? I MYSELF SEE SOMETHING VERY FAMILIAR: NERD-AMERICAN. MOHAMED, A 14-YEAR-OLD HIGH-SCHOOL FRESHMAN IN TEXAS AND THE SON OF AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY FROM SUDAN, IS A CAUSE CLBRE JUST AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE HE WAS HANDCUFFED, FROG-MARCHED OUT OF A CLASSROOM, AND ARRESTED FOR THE CRIME OF SHOWING OFF HIS TECHNOLOGICAL CHOPS BY BUILDING AN ELECTRONIC CLOCK AND BRINGING IT TO SCHOOL TO SHOW HIS ENGINEERING TEACHER. (LET US NOW PRAISE MACARTHUR HIGH SCHOOL IN IRVING, TEXAS, FOR THE FACT THAT 14-YEAR-OLDS THERE HAVE ENGINEERING TEACHERS.) APPARENTLY, AN ENGLISH TEACHER IT HAD TO BE AN ENGLISH TEACHER THOUGHT THE DEVICE LOOKED LIKE A BOMB. IT DIDNT. BUT IT LOOKED A HELL OF A LOT MORE LIKE A BOMB THAN THAT HALF-EATEN POP-TART IN THE POSSESSION OF THAT SEVEN-YEAR-OLD IN MARYLAND LOOKED LIKE A GUN, YET THE CHILD WAS SUSPENDED; IT WAS SURELY MORE REASONABLE TO THINK THAT THOSE CIRCUIT BOARDS CONSTITUTED A BOMB THAN TO THINK THAT THE BANG-BANG! HAND GESTURE OF A TEN-YEAR-OLD IN MILFORD, MASS., CONSTITUTED A SERIOUS THREAT TO SHOOT SOMEBODY; TAKING A HIGH-SCHOOL KID INTO CUSTODY AFTER A TEACHER REPORTS A POSSIBLE BOMB THREAT IS SURELY NO MORE IRRATIONAL THAN ARRESTING AN EIGHTH-GRADER OVER AN NRA T-SHIRT. MOHAMEDS FATHER SAYS THAT HIS SON WAS MISTREATED BECAUSE THE INCIDENT HAPPENED A FEW DAYS AFTER THE ANNUAL COMMEMORATION OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TERROR ATTACKS, AND BECAUSE HIS NAME IS MOHAMED. THE STORY IMMEDIATELY BECAME UBIQUITOUS NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED BONEHEADED AS THAT WAS BUT BECAUSE IT CAN BE USED TO FURTHER A STORY THAT THE MEDIA ALREADY WANT TO TELL: THAT THE UNITED STATES IS MORALLY CORRUPT AND IRREDEEMABLY RACIST; THAT MUSLIMS ARE UNDER SIEGE; THAT WHITE PRIVILEGE BLINDS THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS TO THE CORRUPTION AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING RED, WHITE, AND BLUE. MUSLIM KID MEETS PARANOIA IN TEXAS IS A-1 COPY; NRA-WEARING KID MEETS PARANOIA IN WEST VIRGINIA, NOT SO MUCH. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, NEVER ONE TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CHEAP MORAL PREENING, INVITED MOHAMED TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THATS AN INTERESTING GESTURE: ANYBODY WANT TO HAZARD A GUESS AS TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A YOUNG MAN SHOWED UP AT THE WHITE HOUSE VISITORS CENTER WITH A BACKPACK IN WHICH WAS A HOMEMADE DEVICE FULL OF CIRCUIT BOARDS JOINED TO A TIMING DEVICE? I DO NOT FREQUENT THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT I OFTEN AM IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE OFFICE BUILDINGS IN WASHINGTON, AND MY BEST GUESS IS THAT IF ID TRIED TO BRING MOHAMEDS CLOCK INTO ONE OF THOSE PLACES, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN GUNS DRAWN. OH, BUT THOSE ARE HIGH-SECURITY ENVIRONMENTS! YOU MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO PROTEST. MOHAMED WAS ARRESTED BY HIGH-SCHOOL CAMPUS POLICE IN SUBURBIA, TEXAS. WHY ARE THERE POLICE STATIONED AT SUBURBAN HIGH SCHOOLS? BECAUSE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOW A HIGH-SECURITY ENVIRONMENT, OR AT LEAST MANY OF THEM ARE INTENDED TO BE. THAT IS TRUE NOT ONLYOF BIG CITIES, WHERE THE ARCHITECTURE OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS, NOT COINCIDENTALLY, PENAL; PUBLIC SCHOOLS FAR AND WIDE ACROSS THE FRUITED PLAIN GET THE METAL-DETECTORS-AND-MEN-WITH-GUNS TREATMENT. RELATED: #ISTANDWITHAHMED AGAINST AUTHORITARIAN IDIOCY MAYBE YOU THINK THAT IS APPROPRIATE. MAYBE IT IS. MAYBE EVERY NONCONFORMING TUBE OF OUTLAW PEPSODENT SEIZED BY TSA AGENTS IS IN REALITY A BLOW AGAINST AL-QAEDA, AND MAYBE BRIGHT-ORANGE PLASTIC SQUIRT-GUNS REALLY ARE A MENACE TO POLICE OFFICERS ROLLING THROUGH THE MALLS OF AMERICA IN ARMORED VEHICLES. BUT YOU CANNOT VERY WELL GO ACTIVELY CULTIVATING AN ATMOSPHERE OF PARANOIA AND THEN PRONOUNCE YOURSELF SURPRISED BY ALL THE PARANOIA IN THE AIR. #SHARE#THIS IS AN AGE OF OVERREACTION. IT IS, UNHAPPILY, ALSO AN AGE OF RACE-HUSTLING AND GRIEVANCE-MONGERING. THANK GOODNESS THAT FELONIOUS POP-TART IN MARYLAND WAS ONE OF THE STRAWBERRY-FLAVORED ONES WITH RAINBOW SPRINKLES AND NOT BROWN SUGAR/CINNAMON OR MARSHMALLOW HOT CHOCOLATE OR ANOTHER OF THE FLAVORS OF COLOR, OR WED BE HAVING A NATIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHITE-FROSTING PRIVILEGE. OF COURSE IT IS THE VERY SAME SELF-SATISFIED LIFESTYLE LIBERALS WHO WANT TO SEND YOUR TODDLER TO GITMO FOR PLAYING WITH A CAP GUN WHO ARE SO THEATRICALLY APPALLED AT WHAT HAPPENED TO MOHAMED. THE STRUCTURES OF PARANOIA THAT HAVE BEEN SO ASSIDUOUSLY FORTIFIED AROUND OUR SCHOOLS ARE THERE FOR A PURPOSE, AND THAT PURPOSE IS POLITICAL: TO IMMERSE YOUNG PEOPLE IN A CULTURE IN WHICH NRA LITERATURE IS SAMIZDAT BUT HOW-TO-FELLATE-YOUR-FRIENDS LITERATURE IS MANDATORY, WHERE WHITEWASHED ISLAMIC STUDIES ARE PART OF THE STANDARD CURRICULUM AND CHRISTIAN PRAYER GROUPS ARE VERBOTEN. THE PARANOIA IS INTENTIONAL, IT IS CULTIVATED WITH EXQUISITE CARE BUT IT ISNT SUPPOSED TO INFLICT COLLATERAL DAMAGE ON BESPECTACLED YOUNG MEN NAMED AHMED MOHAMED. THUS, THE PRESIDENTIAL INTERVENTION, ETC. AHMED MOHAMED WAS MISTREATED BY IMBECILES, AND HELL BE FAMOUS FOR IT, FOR 15 WARHOLIAN MINUTES, AND THEN AGAIN FOR A 30-SECOND SPOT WHEN HE GRADUATES IN A FEW YEARS AND GOES OFF TO MIT OR WHEREVER. THE FACT IS THAT HE IS NOT WORSE OFF BECAUSE HIS NAME IS MOHAMED, BUT BETTER OFF: NOBODY WOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION OTHERWISE, AND HE MIGHT VERY WELL BE IN JAIL. BEING MISTREATED BY IMBECILES IS THE SINE QUA NON OF AMERICAN PUBLIC EDUCATION TODAY, BUT THAT FACT IS OF POLITICAL USE ONLY PERIODICALLY, AS IN THIS CASE. KEVIN D.

490	I HAVE TO SAY SINCE 2012, I HAVE FELT A LITTLE HARASSED ABOUT LIVING WITH PULMONARY HYPERTENSION. THE DISEASE ITSELF HAS ITS GOOD DAYS AND BAD DAYS AND I KNOW MY PHYSICAL LIMITS. HOWEVER, THE LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR THE TREATMENT I HAVE (AMBRISENTAN 10 MG AND TADALAFIL 40MG) IS A MONTHLY LIVER FUNCTION BLOOD TEST AND A THREE MONTHLY FULL BLOOD COUNT. IT SOUNDS STRAIGHTFORWARD ENOUGH, DOESNT IT? I GET MONTHLY HEALTHCARE AT HOME MEDICATION AND BLOOD KIT DELIVERIES. I TAKE THE KIT TO MY GP, WHERE THE NURSE OR PHLEBOTOMIST TAKES THE BLOOD, LABELS IT AND I POST IT OFF. A MUCH REQUIRED ARRANGEMENT AS I, LIKE MOST PULMONARY HYPERTENSION PATIENTS DO NOT LIVE LOCALLY TO MY PULMONARY VASCULAR DISEASES UNIT, WHERE OUR CONDITION IS MONITORED AND MANAGED. THE PROBLEM IS I HAVE MADE MORE APPOINTMENTS AND POSTED MORE BOXES THAN I HAVE RESULTS OF LIVER FUNCTION TESTS, IN MY FILE, SINCE COMMENCING TREATMENT. ONLY A FEW MONTHS INTO THIS ROUTINE I RECEIVED STRONGLY WORDED LETTERS FROM THE LEAD PHARMACIST, WHOM I NOW DESPISE ON SIGHT, ALERTING ME TO THE FACT NO BLOOD RESULT HAD BEEN NOTED FOR THE MONTH PRIOR AND IT WAS A LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO HAVE MONTHLY BLOOD TESTS ETC, DESPITE THE FACT I WAS ALREADY MAKING THE EFFORT TO HAVE BLOOD DRAWN AND POSTING IT. IN FACT OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS I HAVE HAD MY MEDICATIONS STOPPED ONCE AND HAD AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN OMINOUSLY WORDED LETTERS REMINDING ME OF MY OBLIGATORY BLOOD TESTS. I BECAME IMMUNE TO THE LETTERS AND FED UP OF THE SOMEWHAT EMPTY GESTURE OF EVEN MAKING AN APPOINTMENT TO GET BLOOD DRAWN, WHICH SEEMED A WASTE OF TIME FOR EVERYONE CONCERNED. AFTER ALL, THESE BLOODS SEEMED TO BE MORE ABOUT TICKING BOXES, THAN ABOUT MY HEALTH AND WELLBEING, IF THEY WERE PREPARED TO STOP MY MEDICATIONS. I DONT ENJOY HAVING BLOOD DRAWN, (WHO DOES?) BUT I ACCEPT THIS AS A TERM OF THE MEDICATION MANAGING MY PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, I AM NOT HAPPY AS A PATIENT, THAT DESPITE FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS AS REQUESTED OF ME, THE SYSTEM FAILS AS MANY TIMES AS IT WORKS. I WAS CAUTIOUSLY ENTHUSED WHEN I RECEIVED THE NEW BLOOD BOX USER GUIDE, NOTING THAT THE PATIENT IDENTIFIERS REQUIRED WERE SLIGHTLY ALTERED AND WE ARE NOW REQUIRED TO PHONE THE PULMONARY HYPERTENSION PHARMACY TEAM AFTER POSTING THE BOX BACK. I HAVE METICULOUSLY FOLLOWED PROCEDURE THIS MONTH AND AM HOPING I GET SOME IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENS TO MY BLOOD AFTER I HAVE POSTED IT AND HOW MANY TIMES THE SAMPLES ARE ADEQUATE ENOUGH TO CONCLUDE IN LEGALLY REQUIRED RESULTS BEING RECORDED IN MY FILE. I HAVE EVEN MADE THE NEXT BLOOD TEST APPOINTMENT FOR NEXT MONTH. I WAIT WITH GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF NO LONGER GETTING THE BUG LETTERS FROM THE PH PHARMACY TEAM SCOLDING ME FOR BREAKING A PROMISE, WHEN I ENDURE WAITING ROOMS AND DRAWING BLOOD ON SUCH A REGULAR BASIS.
491	UPDATE. IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT CLOSE TO TEN YEARS AND I CONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP. RAOUL, IVE KNOWN FOR ALMOST AS LONG, BUT WE LIVE IN THE SAME CITY AND HANG OUT OCCASIONALLY. THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES. CHRISTINE AND I HAD A FALLING OUT SOME TIME AGO AND ONLY RECENTLY RECONNECTED. DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST. ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN THOUGH RAOUL IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, I HAVE GOTTEN TO SEE A LOT OF HIS BAD SIDE (PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, SINCE I DONT TRUST MYSELF TO NOT BE BIASED), INCLUDING HIS (SEEMING) UNWILLINGNESS TO BE AFFECTIONATE EVEN IN A RELATIONSHIP HE INITIATES. IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL IN ONE OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER, THIS WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND RAOUL HAS SINCE CHANGED. ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?). I KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME; I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THAT. BUT I JUST CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. PART OF ME WONDERS IF IM BEING TOO CLINGY ABOUT THIS? ITS THEIR LIVES AND I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO GET IT IN PRACTICE. ANOTHER PART WONDERS IF IM BEING UNFAIR TO RAOUL? MAYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR THEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE. IVE THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW IM NOT AS BOTHERED AS I WAS INITIALLY. UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH. I STILL CANT  FULLY COME TO TERMS WITH IT AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS BETTER THAN THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND  WHY I CANT JUST LIVE AND LET LIVE? WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO? SIGNED, OVERLY ANXIOUS FOR NO GOOD REASON DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, LATELY IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS (LETS CALL THEM RAOUL AND CHRISTINE, FOR CONVENIENCES SAKE) THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND RECENTLY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP.
492	UPDATE (PARIS) THE SUDAN REVOLUTIONARY FRONT (SRF), A COALITION OF REBEL GROUPS, ON WEDNESDAY CALLED ON TSHE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THE DECISION OF THE AFRICAN UNION PEACE AND SECURITY COUNCIL (AUPSC) IN FAVOUR OF A PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING. THE ARMED OPPOSITION GROUPS MADE THEIR DECISION IN THEIR SECOND MEETING WITH INTERNATIONAL SPECIAL ENVOYS HELD IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL PARIS TO DISCUSS POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND DRAW A MAP FOR A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE IN SUDAN. THE MEETING TAKES PLACE AFTER A DECISION BY THE AUPSKC ON 25 AUGUST REITERATING ITS SUPPORT FOR A PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING GATHERING ALL THE ARMED GROUPS AND POLITICAL PARTIES BUT THE RULING NATIONAL CONGRESS PARTY (NCP) REJECTS THIS ROADMAP. SRF EXTERNAL RELATIONS SECRETARY, YASIR ARMAN,, WHO IS ALSO THE SPLM-N SECRETARY-GENERAL, TOLD SUDAN TRIBUNE THAT THE SRF URGED THE INTERNATIONAL ENVOYS TO BACK-THE RECENT DECISION OF THE AFRICAN UNION 539 IN SUPPORT OF A COMPRESSIVE AND INCLUSIVE NATIONAL DIALOGUE PROCESS IN SUDAN. ARMAN FURTHER REVEALED THAT THE ENVOYS HAVE AGREED TO BACK UP THE AUPSCS DECISION ON NATIONAL DIALOGUE. HE ASSERTED THAT THE DECISION WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL WHICH WILL SUPPORT IT, PARTICULARLY SINCE THERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT ANY MATTER THAT WINS REGIONAL CONSENSUS SHOULD RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS AS WELL. THE SECOND MEETING WAS ATTENDED BY US ENVOY TO SUDAN AND SOUTH SUDAN DONALD BOOTH, BRITISH COUNTERPART, MATTHEW CANNELL IN ADDITION TO THE HEAD OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS DGEPARTMENT AT THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTRY JEAN-CHRISTOPHE BELLIARD. ALSO, PRESENT WERE A REPRESENTATIVE OF NORWAY AND THE EU ENVOY FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA ALEXANDER RONDOS. DURING THE MEETING, THE SRF GROUPS STRESSED THEIR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THE UNITY OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, WHICH BESIDES THE REBEL ALLIANCE, INCLUTDE THE NATIONAL UMMA PARTY (NUP), NATIONAL CONSENSUS FORCES (NCF) AND CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS.  NO DEVELOPMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED AT TIMES OF WAR, HE SAID. THE MEETING WAS ADDRESSED VIA CONFERENCE CALL BY NUP LEADER AL-SADIG AL-MAHDI, NCF CHAIRMAN, FAROUK ABU ISSA, AMIN MAKKI MADANI, HEAD OF THE ALLIANCE OF THE SUDANESE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS AND GAHZI SALAH AL-DIN ATTABANI THE LEADER OF THE REFORM NOW MOVEMENT (RNM), A SPLINTER FACTION OF THE RULING PARTY. ARMAN SAID THE PARTICIPATION OF ATTABANI IN THE MEETING MARKS A PROGRESS IN THE RELACTION BETWEEN THE RNM AND THE SRF. HE POINTED OUT THAT THE SRF GROUPS WILL HOLD A THREE-DAY MEETSING IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL TO DISCUSS THE POLITICAL QSITUATION, ADDING THE MEETING SHOULD COME OUT WITH A ROAD MAP FOR ALL ISSUES OF PEACE AND NANTIONAL DIALOGUE IN SUDAN. HE SAID PREPARATIONS WERE UNDERWAY FOR A MEETING OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, BUT HE DID NOT GIVE A SPECIFIC DATE FOR THAT MEETING. ALSO, ARMAN REITERATED THAT SRF ARE COMMITTED TO THE UNITY OF THE OPPOSITION AND TO A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE SETTLEMENT, AWAY FROM PARTIAL SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE PROMISED THE SUDANESE PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE ROADMAP TO EKND WAR. THE BALL IS NOW IN KHARTOUMS COURT. IT IS THE PARTY THAT HAD INITIATED THESE WARS AND IT PERSISRTENTLY REFUSED TO BRING THEM TO AN END, HE ADDED. LQAST SUNDAY, THE DIALOGUE MECHANISM SOFTENED THIS POSITION ON THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING AND ANNOUNCED ACCEPTING TO MEET THES REBEL GROUPS BEFORE THE PROCESS TO DISCUSS THE GUARANTEES ENABLING THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DIALOGUE CONFERENCE IN KHARTOUM. IN PREVIOUS STATEMENTS, THE SPLM-N SECRETARY GENERAL HAD DISMISSED GOVERNMENT PRESS REPORTS THAT KHARTOUM WOULD NOT MIND ATTENDING A PRELIMINARY MEETING WITH SRF AND ARMED GROUPS AS AN ATTEMPT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO CAUSE A RIFT IN THE OPPOSITION FORCES, PARTICULARLY BETWEEN THE SRF AND THE NUP OF SADIQ AL-MAHDI. THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING S SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD IMPLEMENT BEFORE THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO CREATE A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT. THESE INCLUDE A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND HUMANITARIAN ACCESS FOR CIVILIANS IN THE REBEL HELD AREAS, POLITICAL FREEDOMS AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. USM PROPOSAL FOR STOPPING HOSTILITIES US ENVOY DONALD BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT TO THE MEDIA, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED THAT THE REBELS SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT OMER AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. FOLLOWING THE JOINT MEETING, BOOTH MET WITH REBEL GROUPS FROM DARFUR REGION AND DISCUSSED THEIR DEMAND FOR RENEGOTIATING THE DOHA DOCUMENT FOR PEACE IN DARFUR. BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED TO THE REBEL GROUPS THAT THEY SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. SUDAN TRIBUNE LEARNT THAT BOOTH ALSO HELD A SEPARATE MEETING WITH THE SPLM-N TO DISCUSS NEGOTIATIONS WITH KHARTOUM ON A DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES DOCUMENT, INCLUDING A CEASEFIRE, AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO CIVILIANS IN THE SPLM-N CONTROLLED AREAS. ON ITS PART, SUDAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT - ABDEL WAHID AL-NUR ISSUED A STATEMENT REITERATING ITS DEMAND FOR PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS, DISARMING THE JANJAWEED AND THE REMOVAL OF NEW-COMERS FROM THE LANDS AND HAWAKEER. THE STATEMENT CLEARLY PROVIDED THAT THE GROUP WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE WITH KHARTOUM UNTIL THOSE "CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES" WERE MET.

495	IT JUST WASNT A MATTER OF NOT BEING PRETTY, IT WAS JUST PLAIN UGLY BY OHIO STATE STANDARDSA WIN OVER NORTHERN ILLINOIS THAT MIGHT WELL SIGNAL THE SHAKEOUT OF THINGS TO COME. COLUMBUS IF YOURE A FAN OF CARDALE JONES, OR IF YOURE ENAMORED WITH THE CARDALE JONES STORY, THE LEGACY SUCH AS IT IS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET A FILM OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF SATURDAYS 20-13 WIN OVER NORTHERN ILLINOIS. WHY? WELL, BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE THE LAST YOU SEE OF CARDALE JONES PLAYING QUARTERBACK FOR AWHILE. NEVER SAY NEVER IN SPORTS, BUT 4 OF 9 PASSING AND A PAIR OF INTERCEPTIONS AGAINST A MAC TEAM (EVEN A GOOD MAC TEAM) IS NO WAY TO BUILD UPON A LEGACY. IN FACT, ITS A PRETTY GOOD WAY TO GET YOURSELF BENCHED, WHICH IS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED TO JONES. ENTER J.T. BARRETT AT THE START OF THE SECOND QUARTER, WHO PLAYED THE REMAINING THREE, AND FRANKLYHAD SOME ISSUES OF HIS OWN. IF JONES WAS BAD (4 OF 9 FOR 36 YARDS AND 2 PICKS), BARRETT WAS MERELY SLUGGISH, UNINSPIRING, COMPLETING 11 OF 19 PASSES FOR 97 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN, ALONG WITH AN INTERCEPTION OF HIS OWN. IT WAS, IN THE VERNACULAR OF FOOTBALL, A BAD WIN. OHIO STATE DIDNT PLAY WELL FOR THE SECOND WEEK IN A ROWDIDNT EXECUTE, AND DIDNT APPEAR TO PLAY TO ITS STRENGTHS. TRANSLATION: URBAN MEYERS GAME PLAN SEEMED TO FIT RIGHT INTO THE PLANS OF AN ATHLETIC NORTHERN ILLINOIS DEFENSE THAT WAS QUICK ENOUGH TO CHASE DOWN RUNNING BACKS TRYING TO RUN SIDELINE TO SIDELINE. AND MORE THAN ONE OF THE 104,095 THAT WATCHED HAD TO HAVE ASKED THE QUESTION. WHY NOT GIVE THE BALL TO EZEKIEL ELLIOTT AND RUN RIGHT AT EM BEHIND THAT MASSIVE OFFENSIVE LINE? BUT TO THE ISSUE OF QUARTERBACK, MEYER WAS ASKED AFTERWARDS BY ABC ABOUT HOW TO FIX IT. HIS REPLY? WELL, WE HAD A GREAT WEEK OF PRACTICE AND PRACTICE IS THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO GO ON (WHEN YOU PICK A QUARTERBACK). BUT WE HAVE TO GET THAT FIXED. IN HIS POST-GAME PRESS CONFERENCE MEYER CONTINUALLY USED THE WORD DISCOMBOBULATED. SO I KNOW THERES GOING TO BE A MILLION QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFENSE. AND THERE SHOULD BE. THERES A LITTLE DISCOMBOBULATION THATS GOT TO GET WORKED OUT, AND WEVE GOT GOOD PLAYERS, GOOD COACHES, GOOD SCHEME. LINEBACKER DARRON LEE EYES THE GOAL LINE AFTER HIS INTERCEPTION IN THE THIRD QUARTER. HIS TOUCHDOWN RUN OF 43 YARDS WAS THE WINNING MARGIN IN THE GAME. IM OKAY WITH WINNING GAMES. IM NOT OKAY WITH THE FIVE TURNOVERS AND LACKING EXECUTION AND NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, BECAUSE THATS A RECIPE FOR FAILURE, AT SOME POINT (IF YOU DO THAT) YOULL FAIL MISERABLY. TURNOVERS, IF YOU CANT CONTROL THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, YOURE NOT GOING TO WIN A BIG GAME. AND THOSE TWO THINGS HAVE TO GET FIXED FAST. THE REALITY OF SATURDAYS LACKLUSTER WIN IS THIS. IF DARRON LEE DOESNT PICK OFF A PASS FROM NIU QUARTERBACK DREW HARE WITH 1:44 LEFT IN THE THIRD QUARTER, AND RUN IT BACK 43 YARDS FOR A TOUCHDOWN, THERE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A WIN AT ALL. LEES PLAY WAS THE MARGIN OF DIFFERENCE. MORE MEYER: SINCE THE END OF LAST SEASON OUR DEFENSE HAS PLAYED EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. THEY HELD THEM (NIU) TO FAR BELOW THEIR OFFENSIVE AVERAGE TODAY, AND WITH THE FIVE TURNOVERSWELL, THATS EXCEPTIONAL PLAY BY OUR DEFENSE. THE DEFENSE WAS BRILLIANT, THE EVIDENT STRENGTH OF A TEAM THAT OFFENSIVELY PLAYED SATURDAY LIKE A DUCK THAT HAD BEEN STRUCK ON THE HEAD WITH A HAMMER. ITS VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I KNOW WERE CAPABLE OF EXECUTING MUCH BETTER, SAID OFFENSIVE TACKLE TAYLOR DECKER. OUR OFFENSE IS BEING HELD BACK BY US (THE OFFENSIVE LINE), BUT AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR WE WERENT PLAYING AT THAT LEVEL. YEAR-TO-YEAR WE KEEP GETTING BETTER AND I HAVE ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD IN OUR LINE. SAFETY VONN BELL ALREADY HAS ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD ABOUT THE DEFENSE. I THINK WERE PLAYING PHENOMENAL. WERE PLAYING AT A HIGH LEVEL SO HATS OFF TO THOSE GUYS. WERE NOT GIVING UP ANYTHING DEEP AND WERE BEING DISCIPLINED WHICH ALLOWS US TO MAKE PLAYS DOWN THE FIELD. WHICH IS GOOD, BECAUSE EXCEPT FOR AN EARLY TOUCHDOWN RUN BY TAILBACK AREGERO TURNER THE HUSKIES NEVER REALLY THREATENED AGAIN. JOEY BOSA AND ADOLPHUS WASHINGTON WERE BRILLIANT FROM THE DEFENSIVE LINE. BELL AND HIS SECONDARY MATES WERE SIMPLY TO ATHLETIC FOR THE HUSKY OFFENSE TO THREATEN. THERE WERE NO OPEN RECEIVERS FOR MOST OF THE DAY. STILL, THE PINK ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS THE QUARTERBACK POSITION AND LACK OF PRODUCTION FROM IT. MEYER REFUSES TO THROW ANYONE UNDER THE BUS AND WAS DIPLOMATIC WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHO STARTS NEXT WEEK AGAINST WESTERN MICHIGAN. I DONT KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW. I HAVENT HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT, HE ANSWERED. BUT IT WOULD BE HARD AT THIS POINT TO MAKE THE CASE FOR CARDALE JONES, WHO DIDNT PLAY WITH INSTINCT SATURDAY AND LOOKED ROBOTIC. AND, IT WOULD HARD TO ANOINT J.T. BARRETT, WHO AFTER COMING IN THREW A BEAUTIFUL FADE ROUTE FOR A TOUCHDOWN TO MICHAEL THOMAS ON HIS SECOND POSSESSION, LOOKED TENTATIVE AND UNSURE THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE SECOND HALF. THE BEAUTY OF ALL THIS IS, OF COURSE, ITS OHIO STATE FOOTBALL. AND AS MEYER ALLUDED TO BEFORE HE LEFT THE PRESS MEETING ROOM SATURDAY, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ARMCHAIR QUARTERBACKS WILL HAVE IT ALL FIGUREDAND A LOT OF IT FIXEDBY MONDAY. NOT THAT IM GOING TO CALL THE ARMCHAIR PEOPLE AND ASK THEM WHAT THEY THINK, HE SAID WITH A SMILE. BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT NEED FIXIN. FAST! THE SPOT IS PROUD TO SPONSOR COVERAGE OF THE OHIO STATE BUCKEYES ON PRESS PROS MAGAZINE.COM.
496	- IPI PICKS UP IN JULY. MALAYSIAS INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION INDEX (IPI) GREW AT A HEALTHIER PACE OF 6.1% YOY IN JULY, FROM +4.3% IN JUNE. IN PARTICULAR, IPI GREW IN JULY ON THE BACK OF THE MANUFACTURING AND MINING OUTPUT, WHICH ADVANCED BY 4.2% AND 14.0%, RESPECTIVELY. MEANWHILE, THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR CONTRACTED BY 1.2% YOY. WITHIN THE MINING SEGMENT, THE EXPANSION WAS CONTRIBUTED BY THE INCREASE OF THE CRUDE OIL INDEX (+7.5%) AND NATURAL GAS INDEX (+22.3%) - MANUFACTURING OUTPUT GATHERS MOMENTUM. THE MANUFACTURING OUTPUT GAINED TRACTION, PARTLY DRIVEN BY SHIPMENTS ABROAD. THE MAJOR SUB-SECTORS OF MANUFACTURING WHICH INCREASED IN JULY 2015 INCLUDE E&E (+7.2%), PETROLEUM, CHEMICAL, RUBBER AND PLASTIC PRODUCTS (3.3%), AND TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND OTHER MANUFACTURES (8.8%). MANUFACTURING OUTPUT ACCOUNTS FOR 66% OF TOTAL IPI. THAT SAID, WEAK DOMESTIC DEMAND HAD SUPPRESSED OVERALL MANUFACTURING SALES IN JULY. SALES VALUE DECLINED BY 1.2% YOY TO RM54.2BIL VS. +1.7% IN JUNE. - MANUFACTURING PMI CONTRACTS FOR THE FIFTH MONTH IN AUGUST. FORWARD-LOOKING INDICATORS SUGGEST THAT MALAYSIAS MANUFACTURING SEGMENT REMAINED WEAK AS MONTHLY PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX (PMI) CONTRACTED IN AUGUST. THE MANUFACTURING PMI STOOD AT 47.2 POINTS IN AUGUST, BROADLY UNCHANGED FROM JULYS READING OF 47.7. IT HAS BEEN TRENDING BELOW THE 50-THRESHOLD FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE MONTHS AND IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE OCTOBER 2012. MAINLY, NEW ORDERS CONTRACTED AT THE FASTEST RATE SINCE SEPTEMBER 2012, LEADING TO FURTHER DECLINES IN BOTH PRODUCTION AND PURCHASING ACTIVITY. - GLOBAL MANUFACTURING SLOWS AMID WEAKNESSES IN ASIA. GROWTH IN THE GLOBAL MANUFACTURING SECTOR REMAINED LACKLUSTRE AT THE START OF 3Q15. JP MORGAN GLOBAL MANUFACTURING PMI STOOD AT 50.7 POINTS IN AUGUST, BROADLY UNCHANGED FROM 51.0 IN JULY. THE HEADLINE INDEX HAS BEEN HOVERING BELOW THE LONG-RUN TREND IN RECENT MONTHS. NEW ORDER WAS LACKLUSTRE, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SOFT GROWTH MAY CONTINUE IN THE COMING MONTHS IN TANDEM WITH EARLY SIGNS THAT GROWTH IN CONSUMER SPENDING MAY HAVE LOST GROWTH TRACTION. PARTICULARLY, MANUFACTURING PMI IN CHINA HAD DECREASED SLIGHTLY TO 49.7 IN AUGUST FROM 50 IN JULY. AS FOR THE US, MANUFACTURING PMI SLOWED TO 53.0 POINTS IN AUGUST ON SOFTER OUTPUT GROWTH, DOWN FROM 53.8 IN JULY. - MIXED ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE DURING THE START OF 3Q15. RECENT INDICATORS SIGNAL MIXED ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. OUTPUT LEVELS REMAINED HEALTHY WITH PERSISTENT GROWTH FOR THE IPI, ESPECIALLY FOR MANUFACTURING OUTPUT WHICH IS A GOOD PROXY FOR QUARTERLY GDP. ELSEWHERE, LOANS GROWTH ADVANCED FURTHER IN JULY TO REGISTER +9.6% YOY VS. +9.1% IN JUNE. OTHER THAN THAT, THE COUNTRYS LEADING INDEX POSTED AN UPTICK IN JUNE, WITH THE 0.8% YOY INCREASE TO 117.6 POINTS (MAY: -0.2% YOY). HOWEVER, THERE WAS MODERATION IN DOMESTIC DEMAND AND EXPORTS DURING THE MONTH OF JULY. ALSO, THE OVERALL WEAK ECONOMIC SENTIMENTS AND WEAKER-THAN-EXPECTED RINGGIT CURRENCY ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN A DRAG ON THE ECONOMY. SOURCE: AMESECURITIES RESEARCH - 11 SEP 2
497	U.S. SPACE AGENCY NASA ANNOUNCED ON MONDAY IT HAS FOUND "STRONG" EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS LIQUID WATER INTERMITTENTLY FLOWING ON PRESENT-DAY MARS. IMAGES TAKEN FROM THE MARS ORBIT SHOWED DARK, FINGER-LIKE MARKINGS THAT, TYPICALLY LESS THAN FIVE METERS IN WIDTH, APPEAR ON SLOPES DURING WARM SEASONS, LENGTHEN AND THEN FADE DURING COOLER SEASONS ON THE RED PLANET. THESE SURFACE FEATURES, KNOWN AS RECURRING SLOPE LINEAE (RSL), HAVE BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO FORM BY THE ACTIVITY OF BRINES, BUT DIRECT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN LACKING. NOW, USING AN IMAGING SPECTROMETER FROM NASA'S MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO), RESEARCHERS DETECTED SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED MINERALS ON SLOPES WHERE THE MYSTERIOUS STREAKS ARE SEEN ON MARS. "OUR QUEST ON MARS HAS BEEN TO 'FOLLOW THE WATER,' IN OUR SEARCH FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, AND NOW WE HAVE CONVINCING SCIENCE THAT VALIDATES WHAT WE'VE LONG SUSPECTED," SAID JOHN GRUNSFELD, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR OF NASA'S SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE IN WASHINGTON. "THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT, AS IT APPEARS TO CONFIRM THAT WATER -- ALBEIT BRINY -- IS FLOWING TODAY ON THE SURFACE OF MARS." THESE PUZZLING SURFACE FEATURES WERE FIRST NOTICED IN 2010 BY LUJENDRA OJHA, THEN A UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT, USING IMAGES FROM THE MRO'S HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING SCIENCE EXPERIMENT. IN THE NEW STUDY, OJHA, NOW A GRADUATE STUDENT AT GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, AND HIS COLLEAGUES ANALYZED SPECTRA DATA FROM THE COMPACT RECONNAISSANCE IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM) ABOARD THE MRO FROM FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHERE THE RSL FEATURES WERE PRESENT. THEY REPORTED IN THE BRITISH JOURNAL NATURE GEOSCIENCE THAT SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED SALTS AT THESE RSL LOCATIONS EXISTED ONLY WHEN THE DARK FEATURES WERE RELATIVELY WIDE. "WE FOUND THE HYDRATED SALTS ONLY WHEN THE SEASONAL FEATURES WERE WIDEST, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT EITHER THE DARK STREAKS THEMSELVES OR A PROCESS THAT FORMS THEM IS THE SOURCE OF THE HYDRATION," OJHA SAID. "IN EITHER CASE, THE DETECTION OF HYDRATED SALTS ON THESE SLOPES MEANS THAT WATER PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THESE STREAKS." THE RESEARCHERS INTERPRETED THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES AS CAUSED BY HYDRATED MINERALS CALLED PERCHLORATES, WHICH ARE LIKELY A MIXTURE OF MAGNESIUM PERCHLORATE, MAGNESIUM CHLORATE AND SODIUM PERCHLORATE. SOME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO KEEP LIQUIDS FROM FREEZING EVEN WHEN CONDITIONS ARE AS COLD AS MINUS 94 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT (MINUS 70 CELSIUS), NASA SAID. ON EARTH, NATURALLY PRODUCED PERCHLORATES ARE CONCENTRATED IN DESERTS, AND SOME TYPES OF PERCHLORATES CAN BE USED AS ROCKET PROPELLANT. PERCHLORATES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN ON MARS. FOR EXAMPLE, NASA'S PHOENIX LANDER AND CURIOSITY ROVER BOTH FOUND THEM IN THE PLANET'S SOIL, AND SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THAT THE VIKING MISSIONS IN THE 1970S MEASURED SIGNATURES OF THESE SALTS. "HOWEVER, THIS STUDY OF RSL DETECTED PERCHLORATES, NOW IN HYDRATED FORM, IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAN THOSE EXPLORED BY THE LANDERS," NASA SAID. "THIS ALSO IS THE FIRST TIME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM ORBIT." FOR OJHA, THE NEW FINDINGS ARE MORE PROOF THAT THE MYSTERIOUS LINES HE FIRST SAW DARKENING MARTIAN SLOPES FIVE YEARS AGO ARE, INDEED, PRESENT-DAY WATER. "WHEN MOST PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WATER ON MARS, THEY'RE USUALLY TALKING ABOUT ANCIENT WATER OR FROZEN WATER," HE SAID. "NOW WE KNOW THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY. THIS IS THE FIRST SPECTRAL DETECTION THAT UNAMBIGUOUSLY SUPPORTS OUR LIQUID WATER-FORMATION HYPOTHESES FOR RSL."

MISSOURI IS ON PACE FOR 40 PERCENT FEWER METH LAB SEIZURES THIS YEAR THAN LAST, ACCORDING TO MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL DATA. OKLAHOMA BUSTS ARE ON PACE TO DROP 33 PERCENT, WHILE TENNESSEES ARE DOWN 48 PERCENT. THE STEEP DECLINE DOESNT MEAN USERS ARE TURNING AWAY FROM THE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE DRUG. WHAT WERE HEARING THROUGHOUT THE MIDWEST FROM OUR COLLEAGUES IS THEYRE ALL SEEING METH LABS DROP, BUT ITS CRITICAL TO NOTE THAT NO STATE IS SAYING METH USE IS DOWN, SAID MARK WOODWARD OF THE OKLAHOMA BUREAU OF NARCOTICS. ITS JUST THAT THEYVE SWITCHED SOURCES FROM COOKING IT TO IMPORTING IT. METH USE AND ADDICTION ARE STILL EPIDEMIC, HE SAID. THE NUMBER OF METH LAB SEIZURES NATIONWIDE PEAKED AT NEARLY 24,000 IN 2004. THE PROBLEM GOT SO BAD THAT RESTRICTIONS WERE PLACED ON THE SALE OF COLD AND ALLERGY PILLS CONTAINING PSEUDOEPHEDRINE, WHICH GETS MIXED WITH HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS LIKE LIGHTER FLUID OR DRAIN CLEANER TO MAKE HOMEMADE METH. THOSE MEDICATIONS WERE PLACED BEHIND THE COUNTER, WITH BUYING LIMITS AND TRACKING OF SALES. BY 2007, FEWER THAN 7,000 METH LABS WERE SEIZED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. MAKERS AND USERS RESPONDED BY FINDING A WAY TO MAKE METH WITH FEWER PILLS A DANGEROUS CONCOCTION TYPICALLY MIXED IN A 2-LITER SODA BOTTLE.

500	LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY & THECURE IS CURIOSITY. HOW SEEKING CHANGE HAS BROUGHT ME EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEENLOOKING FOR. IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING MY JOURNEY, CHECK OUT THE PREVIOUS PIECES OF THE STORY HERE: WK1 , WK2 , WK3 , WK4 WEVE ALL HEARD THE SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, DOES IT MAKE A SOUND? THIS QUESTION DRAWSON MANY NOTIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE SELF, AND THAT IF ONE DOES NOT EXPERIENCE SOMETHING, THAN THE QUESTION IS DID ITREALLY HAPPEN? BUT LETS GO BACK AND THINK INSTEAD OF THIS SCENARIO: IF LIGHTING STRIKES IN THE WOODS AND STARTS A FIRE, BUT NO ONE IS AROUND TO SEE IT, WILL IT STILL BURN A PART OF THE FOREST DOWN? THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS YES. OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY DOES NOT DICTATE WHAT IS REAL, BUT MERELY WHAT WE ARE PERCEIVING AS AN ACTIVE PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE EXIST. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES, HOW DO WE INCLUDE THIS LIGHTNING STRIKE IN OUR LIVES SO THAT WE CAN BE AN ACTIVE FORCE IN STOPPING THE FOREST FIRE? THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. SINCE WE CANT CHANGE WHERE THE LIGHTNING STRIKES, WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE OUT LOOKING FOR IT. IN SHORT, IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD, WE HAVE TO BE AN ACTIVE PIECE IN IT. OUR BODIES ARE TEMPLES FOR OUR MINDS FLESHY PRISONS WITH WHICH WE TRAVERSE THIS LIFE IN ORDER TO SEEK BALANCE AND PEACE AND FREEDOM. HOWEVER, IN THIS BELIEF, OUR BODIES ARE STILL PLAYERS IN THE GAME OF LIFE; THEY ARE THETEMPLE WITHIN WHICH OUR MINDS RESIDE, SO SHOULDNT WE BE TREATING OUR TEMPLES LIKE TEMPLES?! AND BY THIS, I MEAN TO PUSH OUR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND STAMINA TO THEIR LIMITS AND TO SEEK CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT ON THIS PHYSICAL FORM IN WHICH EXIST. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUS AAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. LETS PLAY THE WHAT IF GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS: WHAT IF YOU ARE WALKING TO YOUR CAR AND THREE PEOPLE GET THE DROP ON YOU; COULD YOU DEFEND YOURSELF? WHAT IF YOUR HOME CATCHES ON FIRE AND THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THE SECOND STORY WINDOW; DO YOU KNOW HOW TO JUMP AND LAND SAFELY? WHAT IF YOUR SON WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM? WHAT IF YOU WORKED A FEW MINUTES FROM HOME AND YOUR WIFE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND NEEDED YOU HOME IMMEDIATELY,BUT YOUR CAR WAS DEAD IN THE PARKING LOT, COULD YOU RUN ALL THE WAY HOME? CAN YOU PROTECT THE ONES YOU LOVE? COULD YOU OUTRUN SOMETHING HUNTING YOU DOWN? CAN YOU SURVIVE ON YOUR OWN WHEN TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE WITHIN REACH TO HELP YOU? I SPENT THE WEEK PRACTICING HUAQUAN AND RUNNING. MY BEST FRIEND, ALSO AN ADVENTURE ENTHUSIAST, AND I SPENT THE WEEKENDCLIMBING THROUGH AERIAL OBSTACLE COURSES IN THE TREES OF THE BERKSHIRES IN MASSACHUSETTS.AFTER THE LONG WEEKEND, I BEGAN THE WEEK LIKE I ALWAYS DO, EXHAUSTED; BUT I COULD FEEL THE HAPPINESS IN EACH SORE MUSCLE FIBER. THE ELONGATED SIGH AS ONE SETTLES IN TO THE COUCH AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, OR INTO A HOT TUB ON THE FIRST DAY OF VACATION, THAT IS WHAT EACH OF MY MUSCLES FEELS. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUSAAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. SO WHAT HAS THIS SHOWN ME? WELL FIRST, LETS RECAP THE RECENT FOUR WEEKS CHALLENGES: I HAVE BEGUN TO REFINE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SINCE I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY. MY GIRLFRIEND STARTED A NEW JOB AS A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHICH REQUIRES HER TO BE WAKING UP AT 3:30AM MOST MORNINGS (LAST NIGHT WE AWOKE AT 1:45AM). I HAVE BEGUN TO WAKE UP WITH HER, AS OPPOSED TO 6AM, AND ENSURE THAT HER BREAKFAST/ LUNCH ARE READY FOR THE DAY. I DONT WORK OUT FOR TWO HOURS, BUT FOR A HALF AN HOUR: A WARM UP ROUTINE CONSISTING OF PUSH UPS, SIT UPS, LEG RAISES, AND TRICEP DIPS. I SPEND THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING IMMERSED IN THE ONLINE WORLD CHECKING EMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS, NETWORKING, WORKING ON WRITING/ EDITING, OR SOME MORNINGS JUST GAMING. AS MY LIFE EVOLVES, SO MUST I. THOSE THAT ARE AFRAID OF CHANGE GET LEFT IN THE DUST. MILAN KUNDERA, CZECH BORN EXISTENTIAL WRITER, POSED THAT: ANYONE WHOSE GOAL IS SOMETHING HIGHER MUST EXPECT SOMEDAY TO SUFFER VERTIGO. WHAT IS VERTIGO? FEAR OF FALLING? NO, VERTIGO IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN FEAR OF FALLING. IT IS THE VOICE OF THE EMPTINESS BELOW US WHICH TEMPTS AND LURES US, IT IS THE DESIRE TO FALL, AGAINST WHICH, TERRIFIED, WE DEFEND OURSELVES. I TIME LAST WEEK WORKING ON EXACTLY WHAT I SET OUT TO DO. I DREW UP A BUSINESS PLAN FOR LAUNCHING MY OWN COMPANY.OVER THE COURSE THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE RESEARCHED SIMILAR PEOPLE TO MYSELF AND THEIR VENTURES. THE VERDICT IS IN: STARTING OUT ON YOUR OWN IS DIFFICULT; IN WAYS THAT I COULD SIT HERE AND DESCRIBE TO YOU, BUT I DONT WANT YOU TO BE AFRAID OF EVER DOING IT.IT REQUIRES PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE AND A LOT OF HARD WORK. AS ANAIS NIN WROTE, LIFE SHRINKS OR EXPANDS IN PROPORTION TO ONES COURAGE. IF YOU DESIRE STRONGLY ENOUGH AND POSSESS THE PROPER COURAGE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. I PRESENTED MYBUSINESS PLAN TO MY BEST FRIEND OVER COFFEE. WE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF MY PLAN. IT WILL REQUIRE HUGE EFFORT AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR FREE TIME. HOWEVER, AFTER MUCH DELIBERATING, WE HAVE DECIDED TO PURSUE THIS AVENUE AS A MEANS TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE.IT WILL STILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE BUILD UP A PLATFORM FROM WHICH WE CAN LAUNCH. FOR NOW, THIS MEANSTHAT THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS OF MY JOURNEY HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS IM WELL ON THE WAY TO LOVING MY LIFE AND FINDING MORE AND MORE WAYS TO BATTLE MY DEPRESSION WHEN IT REARS ITS UGLY HEAD! HOWEVER, IM NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS METAPHOR, THATS A GOOD THING. THE ONLY WAY IN LIFE WE COULD EVER HEAR THAT TREE FALL, OR STOP THAT FOREST FIRE, IS TO BE PRESENT; AND THAT MEANS PUTTING YOURSELF INTO SITUATIONS THAT YOU WOULDNT NORMALLY BE IN. THOUGH WHAT IS NORMAL? THE TREND OF A THING TO REMAIN AT A CONSTANT ACCEPTED BY A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN PLACE. BECAUSE NORMAL FOR YOU MAY NOT BE NORMAL FOR ME. BECAUSE NORMAL ALL OVER THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT. SO GO LEARN ABOUT OTHER NORMALS. LIVE. JOURNEY. ADVENTURE. ALL OF LIFE IS ADVENTURE. BUT DYLLON, I DONT HAVE THE TIME TO BE ADVENTURING, OR STARTING NEW THINGS IM AN INDOORS GUY, GOING OUT AND ADVENTURING JUST ISNT FOR ME I LIVE IN A CITY, WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND A TREE IN A CITY IN 2015? THESE ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS. BUT OTHER THAN THE LAST GUY WHO IS STILL CAUGHT UP ON THE TREE METAPHOR, KEEP IN MIND WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY, ADVENTURE. TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER ANY TIME PERIOD IN YOUR LIFE. OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE REMEMBERING THE TIME PERIOD BASED ON THE EVENTS. YOU DONT REMEMBER EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR DAYS BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE WASNT EXCITING; EVERY MINUTE DIDNT LEAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION ON YOU. WHAT STANDS OUT IN LIFE WHAT REALLY GIVES YOU ENERGY AND MAKES YOU GO IS THE UNUSUAL, THE CHANGE, & THE AWESOME. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. WALKING TO THE BATHROOM ON YOUR HANDS. BUILDING A FORT WITH YOUR KIDS. COOKING A FOREIGN DISH FOR AROUND THE WORLD NIGHT FOR YOUR WIFE. SEEING A TREND? REMEMBER: CHALLENGING YOURSELF WILL ONLY PRODUCE POSITIVE EFFECTS. NEW EXPERIENCES CAN ONLY CAUSE US TO GROW. THUSLY, MY CHALLENGE FOR THIS UPCOMING WEEK WILL BE TO ADVENTURE AT LEAST ONCE A DAY, AND DO SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING AT LEAST ONCEEACH WEEK. LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY, AND THE CURE IS CURIOSITY. CURIOSITY IS THE FUEL OF THE SOUL. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU ARE NOT SURE WHERE TO START, WRITE OR TWEET TO ME! AND COME BACK FOR NEXT WEEKS ARTICLE!

501	SHEPSHED DYNAMO ARE OUT OF THE FA CUP FOLLOWING A 4-1 DEFEAT AGAINST RUSHALL OLYMPIC. THE 1ST QUALIFYING ROUND MATCH HAD TO BE REPLAYED ON TUESDAY AFTER SATURDAYS GAME ENDED IN A GOALLESS TIE. DESPITE DYNAMO TAKING AN EARLY LEAD, RUSHALL, BACK ON THEIR OWN GROUND, PROVIDED A STERNER TEST AND IT IS OLYMPIC WHO WILL TRAVEL TO CORBY TOWN IN THE FA CUP 2ND QUALIFYING ROUND. SHEPSHED OPENED STRONGLY WITH PORTER CLOSE IN THE EARLY MINUTES. THEN ON THREE MINUTES IT COULD BE DEFINED AS A POSSIBLE GAME CHANGING INCIDENT. JAKE BETTS BACK PASS WAS CLEARED BY LAURIE PEARSON BUT WAS CAUGHT BY A LATE TACKLE FROM LUKE BENBOW. AFTER A LENGTHY DELAY WHILE PEARSON RECEIVED TREATMENT, SHEPSHED RESTARTED WITH BETTS GOAL KICK FINDING PORTER WHO SHRUGGED OFF MITCHELL TOLLEY AND MOVED THE BALL INSIDE TO DUFFY. HIS THROUGH BALL FOUND REEVE TO SHOOT PAST DEAN COLEMAN TO GIVE SHEPSHED AN EARLY LEAD. THREE MINUTES LATER, PEARSON WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE AND WAS REPLACED BY ALEX DAVIES. SHEPSHED CAME CLOSE AGAIN ON FIFTEEN MINUTES, REEVE AND LANGHAM COMBINING WELL BUT DUFFYS EFFORT WAS DEFLECTED OVER. SHEPSHED WERE TAKING THE GAME TO RUSHALL AND THEIR ONLY EFFORT OF NOTE WAS ON 17 MINUTES, ALEX REID FINDING LUKE BENBOW BUT HIS SHOT WENT WIDE. DYNAMO HAD FURTHER EFFORTS THROUGH MIVELD AND PORTER GOING CLOSE. RUSHALL BEGAN TO BREAK THE GAME DOWN AND BEGAN TO EXERT THEIR HIGHER LEAGUE INFLUENCE, DAVIES SAVING FROM BENBOW ON 25 MINUTES AND AGAIN THREE MINUTES LATER. RUSHALL EQUALISED ON 37 MINUTES, A DIAGONAL BALL BY TOLLEY CAUGHT OUT THE SHEPSHED DEFENCE AND ROBERTS CURLED HIS RIGHT FOOT SHOT PAST DAVIES. THREE MINUTES LATER AND OLYMPIC WERE IN FRONT, THE BALL WAS FLICKED ON FROM A THROW IN AND ALEX REID HELD THE BALL UP, TURNED AND FIRED PAST DAVIES. SHEPSHED WERE UNLUCKY NOT TO LEVEL STRAIGHT FROM THE KICK OFF, REEVES EFFORT TIPPED ONTO THE POST FOR A CORNER BY COLEMAN. FOUR MINUTES INTO THE HALF RUSHALL EXTENDED THEIR LEAD, REID LATCHING ONTO A THROUGH BALL TO SLOT PAST DAVIES. RUSHALL WERE BEGINNING TO CONTROL THE GAME AND ON 56 MINUTES A SPECULATIVE LOB FROM BENBOW WAS MET WITH A FIERCE VOLLEY BY REID FOR HIS HAT TRICK. SHEPSHED DIDNT GIVE UP AND DUFFY WENT CLOSE WITH A FREE KICK AND MEADE WAS THEN DEEMED OFFSIDE. RUSHALL CONTINUED TO PRESS AND DAVIES PROVIDED A SUCCESSION OF FINE SAVES BEFORE SAM YOUNG BROUGHT DOWN MALACHITE FARQUHARSON FOR A PENALTY BUT DEBUTANTE REPLACEMENT DAVIES IN THE SHEPSHED GOAL WAS EQUAL TO REIDS SPOT KICK. RUSHALL WERE IN SEARCH OF A FIFTH WITH 12 MINUTES TO GO. FARQUHARSONS HEADER LOOKED GOAL BOUND BUT DAVIES PULLED OFF A FINE SAVE TO TIP THE BALL OVER THE TOP. ALTHOUGH THE GAME WAS OUT OF SHEPSHEDS REACH, THEY FINISHED THE GAME STRONG WITH ADAM HOHNS HEADER TIPPED OVER BY COLEMAN AND REEVES PULL BACK CLEARED. ONCE RUSHALL OLYMPIC HAD TAKEN THE LEAD, THEY USED THEIR HIGHER LEAGUE EXPERIENCE TO THEIR ADVANTAGE BUT SHEPSHED CAN TAKE A LOT FROM THE TWO GAMES. ATTENTIONS TURN BACK TO THE MIDLAND FOOTBALL LEAGUE ACTION AS THE TEAM TRAVEL TO HEREFORD ON SATURDAY. TUESDAYS LEAGUE CUP GAME AGAINST LOUGHBOROUGH UNI HAS BEEN REARRANGED AND WILL NOW TAKE PLACE AT THE DOVECOTE ON SEPTEMBER 29.

I REALLY HOPE THIS ARTICLE HAS HELPED YOU TOGETHER WITH POINTED YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TAKING VITAMINB7 (BIOTIN) PILLS MIGHT NOT INFLUENCE THE SKIN AT ALL, IT REALLY DEPENDS ON ONE'S BODY.

510	CATERHAM PHOTOGRAPHER 'CHASING THE PERFECT PICTURE' TALKS ABOUT HER CAREER CAPTURING ARTISTS ON TOUR 16:48, 22 SEP 2015 UPDATED 16:49, 22 SEP 2015 BY AMANIHUGHES, CHRISTIE GOODWIN HAS BEEN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS SINCE THE AGE OF 12 AND HAS BUILT UP AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY CAPTURING TOP RECORDING ARTISTS ON TOUR VIEW GALLERY FROM THE LIKES OF KATY PERRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND ONE DIRECTION, THIS PHOTOGRAPHER FROM CATERHAM HAS CAPTURED A HEAP OF FAMOUS NAMES AND IS CONTINUING HER SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT PICTURE. CHRISTIE GOODWIN, A BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHER, WHOSE CAREER SPANS MORE THAN 35 YEARS, STARTED TAKING PICTURES AT THE AGE OF 12 AND WAS BOUGHT HER FIRST CAMERA AT 13. SHE GRADUATED FROM THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS IN ANTWERP AND GOT HER FIRST JOB IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY, EVOLVING TOWARDS EDITORIAL AND WORKING FOR NEWS AGENCIES BEFORE ENDING UP IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND TAKING PICTURES OF ARTISTS ON TOUR. CHRISTIE'S PORTFOLIO IS A WHO'S WHO OF TOP NAMES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, INCLUDING KATY PERRY, ED SHEERAN, USHER, TAYLOR SWIFT, ONE DIRECTION, SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY AND KYLIE MINOGUE, AMONG MANY OTHERS. SHE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME ON TOUR CAPTURING IMAGES OF ARTISTS WHICH APPEAR ON CDS, DVDS, TOUR MERCHANDISE, POSTERS, INTERNATIONAL PUBLICATIONS, BOOKS AND EXHIBITIONS. EVEN THOUGH CHRISTIE HAS BEEN ON TOUR WITH MANY ARTISTS SHE ADMITTED SHE IS STILL ON THE HUNT FOR THE ELUSIVE PERFECT PICTURE. THE THING I HAVE BEEN CHASING IS THE PERFECT PICTURE, IT KEEPS ME GOING, TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT, CHRISTIE SAID. PHOTOGRAPHY IS BASICALLY ONE MOMENT IN TIME AND YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL TO OTHERS, THAT'S WHY YOU CAPTURE IT, TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE WHAT YOU FELT AND WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED. I WANT TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT IN TIME, IF I SHOOT A SHOW I WANT THE VIEWER TO FEEL LIKE THEY WERE THERE, THAT WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT A PICTURE THEY FEEL THE MUSIC AND FEEL THE CROWD. THAT'S WHAT I AIM FOR IN MY PHOTOGRAPHY. @CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE EXPLAINED OUT OF ALL THE TOURS SHE HAS CAPTURED, KATY PERRY'S PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR WAS THE MOST EXCITING. I STARTED DOING THE REHEARSALS SO I ACTUALLY SAW THE SHOW BUILD UP TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE END, I SPEND TWO TO THREE WEEKS ON THE SHOW. IT WAS REALLY EXCITING TO SEE HOW SOMETHING COMES TO LIFE. THROUGHOUT HER ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER CHRISTIE HAS CAPTURED SOME POWERFUL IMAGES, FROM BB KING AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL TO SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY STRUMMING A GUITAR. HOWEVER SHE EXPLAINED HER FAVOURITE MOMENT TAKEN SO FAR WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF KATY PERRY DURING HER PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR. AN IMAGE WHICH IS NOW ICONIC AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD TO PUBLICISE THE TOUR. IN THE SHOW IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE FIREWORKS WERE BEHIND HER, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN, CHRISTIE SAID. THE MOMENT THE FIREWORKS GO, YOU GET TO SHOOT THREE FRAMES, SHE DIDN'T HAVE HER HEAD AROUND, THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE FIREWORKS. THAT FRAME HAS MADE HISTORY AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD, IT WAS A LUCKY SHOT AND I WAS HAPPY THAT WE GOT IT. ALWAYS ON THE MOVE EVEN THOUGH PHOTOGRAPHING FAMOUS ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS SOUNDS EXCITING AND CONSTANTLY DIFFERENT, CHRISTIE ASSURED IT WAS NOT ALWAYS GLAMOROUS, AS YOU ARE ALWAYS ON THE MOVE AND NEVER IN ONE PLACE FOR VERY LONG. WHEN YOU DO NOT TRAVEL, IT'S VERY EXCITING BUT WHEN YOU TRAVEL ALL THE TIME, LITTLE THINGS START TO BOTHER YOU, YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR LAUNDRY AND YOU ARE NOT IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG TIME, IT'S A DRAG. HOWEVER IN CONTRAST TO THIS CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE EASILY GETS BORED AND ITCHY FEET WHEN SHE COMES HOME TO CATERHAM AND IS EAGER TO GET OFF TO HER NEXT DESTINATION AND NEXT TOUR. THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS I DO ENJOY, YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES, SLEEP IN YOUR OWN BED, BUT AFTER THREE DAYS I WANT TO GO AGAIN, I GET BORED. WHEN I AM ON THE ROAD, I WANT TO BE BACK AT HOME AND WHEN I'M HOME I WANT TO BE ON THE ROAD. I CANNOT LIVE AT HOME, I WOULD GET BORED, BUT YOU ALSO CANNOT BE ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME, I NEED A COMBINATION OF THE TWO. WHEN ASKED IF SHE COULD IMAGINE HER LIFE TAKING A DIFFERENT PATH, CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED DOING ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN PHOTOGRAPHY. I COULD NOT BE ANYTHING ELSE, WHEN I PICK UP A CAMERA, IT'S JUST ME AND THE CAMERA, IT'S PART OF ME, IT'S WHO I AM, I CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT THE CAMERA. TAKE PHOTOS LIKE A PRO CHRISTIE HAS TEAMED UP WITH CURRYS PC WORLD TO HELP MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR CAMERA EQUIPMENT AND PROVIDES HER TOP TIPS ON HOW TO CAPTURE PHOTOGRAPHS AT FESTIVALS, FROM TAKING THE PERFECT FESTIVAL SELFIE, LOOKING TO NAVIGATE OBSTRUCTIVE CROWDS OR CAPTURING FAST-MOVING STAGE ACTION. PLAN AHEAD: LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE, KNOW WHICH ARTISTS YOU WANT TO SHOOT, AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT IF YOU WISH TO PHOTOGRAPH BANDS ON DIFFERENT STAGES, YOU NEED TO GET THERE IN TIME. ALSO PREPARE FOR THE FACT THAT THEY MIGHT NOT START EXACTLY WHEN THEYRE SUPPOSED TO. I ALWAYS CARRY MY OWN FESTIVAL SCHEDULE ON MY PHONE. SHOOTING MY FIRST BIG FESTIVAL EARLY ON IN MY CAREER, I NEARLY MISSED AC/DC, BECAUSE I WASNT PREPARED! BE PREPARED: MAKE SURE YOU BRING ENOUGH MEMORY CARDS AND BATTERY POWER TO LAST ALL THE WAY. CHANCES ARE YOU WONT HAVE ANYWHERE TO CHARGE THEM FOR HOURS AND YOU DONT WANT TO RUN OUT JUST BEFORE YOUR FAVOURITE BAND IS ON. KEEP THEM IN A LITTLE POUCH WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES AND MAKE SURE ITS WATERPROOF, SO YOU DONT BECOME VICTIM TO FAILING CAMERA EQUIPMENT. COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS: FESTIVAL STAGES CAN BE QUITE MESSY AND CLUTTERY, SO TAKE THE TIME TO COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS. LOOK FOR ANGLES WHERE YOU CAN AVOID PEOPLE OR OBJECTS THAT WILL MAKE THE PHOTO LOOK A MESS. FESTIVAL STAGES CAN ALSO BE VERY HIGH, ESPECIALLY THE MAIN STAGE, SO IT CAN EVEN BE A CHALLENGE FOR US PROS IN THE PHOTO PIT IN FRONT OF THE STAGE. BUT MAKE SURE YOU WAIT FOR THOSE MOMENTS WHEN YOUR FAVOURITE SINGER IS RIGHT AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE THATS WHERE YOU GET YOUR BEST SHOTS. REMEMBER THE CROWD: SOME OF MY BEST SHOTS ARE NOT OF THE ARTISTS BUT OF PEOPLE IN THE CROWD. THE CROWD OFTEN MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE AND CAN BRING TO LIFE THAT FEELING YOU GET BEING AT A FESTIVAL. THE GO PRO HERO 4 OR EE 4GEE ACTION CAM ARE GREAT FOR THIS KIND OF SHOT DUE TO THEIR ULTRA-WIDE ANGLE LENSES FOR A UNIQUE CROWD VIEW. WHEN YOU DO THIS, TRY TO HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER OR EVEN LOWER, PLAY WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES. MAKE SURE TO ALSO TAKE AT LEAST ONE LONG WALK AROUND THE WHOLE FESTIVAL GROUND TO HELP YOU FIND THE PERFECT SUBJECTS. MIND THE RAIN: FESTIVALS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR EVER-CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS. PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEOPLE IN THE MUD ARE TOKEN FESTIVAL SHOTS. HAVING RAIN VISIBLE IN THE SHOT CAN ADD SOMETHING INTERESTING, SO DONT TAKE IT AS A BAD THING. I NEVER GO TO A FESTIVAL WITHOUT A PLASTIC BAG TO PROTECT MY GEAR, AND HAVING A WATERPROOF CASE OR AN ACTUAL WATERPROOF CAMERA LIKE THE FUJIFILM XP80 CAN HELP TO CATER FOR ANY WEATHER CHANGE. CONSIDER YOUR LENSES: CHANGING LENSES IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD CAN BE A NIGHTMARE. DUST, MUD, THE BOOTS OF A CROWDSURFER AND AN AIRBOURNE CUP OF BEER HAVE A WAY OF FINDING YOU THE TIME YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LENS. PRACTICE CHANGING THE LENS UNDER A PLASTIC BAG OR UNDER YOUR JACKET. BECOME A FESTIVAL SELFIE KING OR QUEEN: IF YOURE GOING TO TAKE A SELFIE, MAKE SURE THE SELFIE TELLS A STORY. YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE OF YOURSELF, OR YOU CAN TAKE A FEW EXTRA SECONDS AND FRAME THAT SELFIE A LITTLE BETTER, GET SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THE SHOT, OR SOMETHING ANNOYING OUT OF IT. TAKE YOUR TIME, LOOK AROUND, AND MAYBE HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER SO THAT YOU HAVE THE WHOLE FESTIVAL IN THE BACKGROUND. IF YOU TAKE A LOT OF SELFIES, THE COMPACT PANASONIC TZ57 HAS A SELFIE SCREEN AND WI-FI SO YOU CAN POST IT ON THE WEB IMMEDIATELY. THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT: WHEN YOU TAKE PHOTOS OF YOUR FRIENDS, OR WHEN YOU TAKE SELFIES, TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT. IF THE SUN IS BEHIND THE PERSON IN THE PHOTO, THEIR FACE WILL BE DARKER. ITS NOT A BAD IDEA TO USE A FLASH IF YOURE SHOOTING AGAINST THE LIGHT, EVEN ON A SUNNY DAY. OR DO THE OPPOSITE, SHOOT AGAINST THE LIGHT AND PLAY WITH DARK SILHOUETTES. YOU DONT NEED A PRO CAMERA TO GET AN AMAZING SHOT LIKE THAT. TAKE IN THE VIEW: IT CAN BE REALLY FUN TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT LENSES. A FISH-EYE OR WIDE-ANGLE LENS CAN REALLY HELP CAPTURE THE SCALE OF THE FESTIVAL. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE FUN. A FISH-EYE IS A PRIME LENS, MEANING THAT YOU CANT ZOOM IN OR OUT WITH IT. THEREFORE, ITS UP TO YOU TO ACT AS THE ZOOM FOR THE LENS. BE SURE TO CHANGE PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES AND LINES. GET DOWN LOW TO THE GROUND, EVEN IF IT MEANS LAYING ON YOUR STOMACH IN WHATS LEFT OF THE FESTIVAL GRASS. LEAN UP AGAINST A WALL AND USE THE DISTORTION OF THE LENS TO WRAP THE WALL AROUND THE FRAME. JUST HAVE FUN! BE AWARE THAT IF YOU FRAME A CLOSE UP OF A PERSON NEAR THE OUTER EDGES OF A WIDE ANGLE OR FISH-EYE SHOT, THEIR FACE CAN BE STRETCHED OUT. KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT: THIS ONE IS CRUCIAL. GETTING A NEW CAMERA WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT FEATURES IS TEMPTING, BUT MAKE SURE YOU LEARN HOW TO USE THEM. WALK THROUGH THE MANUAL GUIDE AND TEST IT ALL OUT. IT MIGHT SEEM A BIT TEDIOUS TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE STEPS BUT EVEN THE PRO PHOTOGRAPHER TAKES HIS TIME TO LEARN TO KNOW THEIR CAMERA. ONCE YOU KNOW ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF YOUR CAMERA AND HOW TO USE THEM THEN THERE IS NOTHING STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND THAT PERFECT SHOT. CHRISTIE ADDED TO TAKE MANY PHOTOS, AS IT IS THE VOLUME THAT MATTERS AND GET TO KNOW YOUR CAMERA. DO NOT SHOOT ON THE AUTOMATIC, PUT YOUR CAMERA ON MANUAL AND TEST IT OUT, YOU CANNOT LET THE CAMERA THINK FOR YOU, YOU HAVE TO THINK FOR THE CAMERA AND SHOOT WHAT YOU WANT.

511	I MENTIONED IT LAST WEEK, BUT I'M OUT OF TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS IN SEATTLE AND CHICAGO (HOUSE HUNTING FOR OUR NEW PLACE AND SAYING GOODBYE TO MY CHILDHOOD HOME) AND I'VE RALLIED A FEW OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGER FRIENDS TO FILL IN FOR ME FOR THIS ENTIRE WEEK. THE FIRST GUEST BLOGGER IS LAUREN, WHOSE BLOG, POST GRAD IN PROGRESS, I FOUND THROUGH A LINK UP. SHE'S SUPER SWEET AND YOU'LL LOVE HER! HELLO, HELLO, THANKS SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME JULIE! IFEEL PRETTY HONORED, HUMBLED,ANDTHRILLEDBY JULIE'S GRACIOUS INVITATION FOR ME TO GUEST BLOG WHILE SHE'S AWAY. BUT BEFORE I GET AHEAD OF MYSELF LET'S START WITH AN INTRODUCTION. HI, I'M THE POST GRAD AND I BLOG AT POST GRAD IN PROGRESS. BUT MY NAME IS LAUREN AND I'M A NEW GRADUATE NAVIGATING THROUGH THE REAL WORLD TRYING TO DIG DEEP INTO WHAT MAKES ME TICK.THE REAL WORLD FOR ME BEING, MOVING TO A NEW CITY, STARTING A NEW JOB, AND MOLDING NEW FRIENDSHIPS ALONG THE WAY. MY BLOG IS MY HAPPY PLACE. IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT LIKE MY FAVORITE ANTHROPOLOGIE HACK COASTERS, WRITE RECIPES LIKE MY DELICIOUS MEATLOAF, AND DETAIL MY TRAVELS: RUSSIA, SAN DIEGO (PART 1), SAN DIEGO (PART 2), AND MY NEW ADVENTURE OF EAT, PRAY, LOVING IT IN EUROPE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGERS, ERIKA, DOES THIS SERIES OWNING IT WHERE YOU TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR QUIRKS AND WHAT MAKES YOU, WELL, YOU. EVERY TIME I READ A NEW POST ON A NEW BLOGGER I RACK MY BRAIN OF WHAT I DO THAT IS UNIQUE TO ME. ALAS, THIS MAKES THE PERFECT GUEST POST. I BASICALLY GET ALL MY JUNK ON THE TABLE FROM THE GET-GO! THIS COULD GO ONE OF TWO WAYS...SOME PEOPLE WILL RELATE OR JUST LAUGH AT MY CRAZINESS OR SOME PEOPLE MIGHT RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BUT HEY, I'MOWNINGIT. TODAY AND EVERYDAY. HI I'M LAUREN. 22 YEARS OLD AND I STILL SLEEP WITH MY BABY "BLANKET." YES, I PUT BLANKET IN QUOTATIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY, IT ISN'T A BLANKET ANYMORE. HE IS THEREMNANTOF A FORMER BLANKET TIED TOGETHER IN A RAG. ALSO, YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT I REFER TO MY BLANKET AS "HE" BECAUSE HE JUST ALWAYS HAS BEEN. WEIRD, I KNOW. I CALL HIM "T" BECAUSE MY BABYSITTER CALLED HIM MY TRANQUILIZER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND IT STUCK. HE'S A SENSE OF COMFORT AND MAY I SAY, AWELL-TRAVELEDBLANKET. GOOD GRACIOUS, I'VE LOST HALF OF JULIE'S READERS BY THIS POINT. I'M THE CLUMSIEST PERSON YOU'LL MEET BUT I'VE NEVER BROKEN A BONE AND I'VE NEVER HAD STITCHES. PICTURE ME KNOCKING ON WOOD AT THIS MOMENT. RAW POTATOES GIVE ME THE HEEBIE JEEBIES. I LOVE THE TASTE OF POTATOES...FRENCH FRIES, BAKED POTATOES, SCALLOPED POTATOES...BUT RAW POTATOES FREAK. ME. OUT. MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY SMELL LIKE DIRT AND THEY CAN GROW ROOTS WHEN THEY SIT IN YOUR PANTRY TOO LONG. MY SKIN CRAWLS THINKING ABOUT IT. P.S. JUST POTATOES NOT SWEET POTATOES.I'M STRANGE. I CRY AT THE DROP OF THE HAT. ONEYOUTUBEVIDEO OF A SOLDIER REUNITING WITH HIS FAMILY AND I'M DUNZO. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE, I CRY LAUGHING SO EASILY. IT'S BORDERLINE EMBARRASSING BECAUSE ONCE I GET GOING I CAN'T STOP. ALSO, MY CRYING LAUGHING DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE WHERE I AM. MY COWORKERS HAVE SEEN ME CRYING LAUGHING WAY TOO MANY TIMES. WHEN I WAS IN 2ND GRADE AND MY FAMILY WENT TO JAMAICA I DECIDED IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO GET MY ENTIRE HEAD BRAIDED. I JUST GOT GLASSES, I BURN EASILY, AND I WAS GOING THROUGH AN AWKWARD STAGE SO LET'S JUST SAY THOSE PICTURES ARE ROUGH. BUT MY FRIENDS AND I GET A KICK OUT OF THEM. I THINK ILL STOP THERE. I WANT TO KEEP SOME OF MY CARDS CLOSE TO MY CHEST[SYMBOL]. BUT WEIRDNESS ASIDE, IM A GIRL WHO LOVES GOD, HER FAMILY & FRIENDS, BEING CREATIVE, AND TRAVELING. SEE WHAT CRAZY THING IM UP TO NEXT MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, AND FRIDAY OF EVERY WEEK @ POST GRAD IN PROGRESS! THANKS FOR LISTENING! HAVE A GREAT DAY, FRIENDS XOXO. THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR POST LAUREN! I ALWAYS LOVE LEARNING MORE ABOUT MY BLOGGER FRIENDS. I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOUR VERY OWN EAT, PRAY, LOVE ADVENTURE NEXT MONTH!

ITS ONE OF THOSE EVENING CLASSES FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THEYRE DOING SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE WITH THEIR EVENINGS. ITS A SMALL CLASS, BUT QUITE ENTERTAINING. THE INSTRUCTOR IS FROM MEXICO AND HAS A DIFFICULT (FOR ME) SPANISH ACCENT. TO MY RIGHT IS THE GENTLEMAN FROM INDIA WHO SPEAKS WITH ONE OF THOSE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT ACCENTS. BEHIND ME AND TO MY RIGHT IS THE DELIGHTFUL YOUNG LADY WHO JUST MOVED HERE FROM TURKEY, LIMPS ALONG IN ENGLISH AND HAS DECIDED SHE NEEDS TO ALSO SPEAK SPANISH. THE REST OF US SPEAK TEXAN.

514	FOOTBALL: WITH TWO CONFERENCE TITLES TO ITS CREDIT LAST SEASON, YOUTH TACKLE ORGANIZATION OPENS 2015 CAMPAIGN SATURDAY. CAPTIONS PHOTO GALLERY: LA CANADA GLADIATOR YOUTH FOOTBALL PRACTICE JUNIOR GREMLINS RUNS SIDE-TO-SIDE DOING AGILITY DRILLS AT A GLADIATORS YOUTH FOOTBALL PRACTICE AT LA CAADA HIGH SCHOOL IN LA CAADA FLINTRIDGE ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2015. (TIM BERGER / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER /SEPTEMBER 3, 2015) 2 SEPTEMBER 9, 2015 | 1:27 P.M. KEVIN LACEY CONTINUES TO BE AMAZED AT THE HARD WORK AND DEDICATION OF A SMALL GROUP OF YOUNG ATHLETES. THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER, MEMBERS OF THE LA CAADA GLADIATORS YOUTH TACKLE FOOTBALL PROGRAM HAVE TOILED THROUGH HOT PRACTICES, SHED NUMEROUS POUNDS IN TRYING TO MAKE WEIGHT AND READIED THEMSELVES FOR THE SEASON AHEAD. RELATED PHOTO GALLERY: LA CAADA GLADIATOR YOUTH FOOTBALL PRACTICE JEFF TULLY SIGNATURE FOR FOUR GLADIATORS TEAMS, WHOPLAY THEIR HOME GAMES AT LA CAADA HIGH, ALL THEIR WORK AND SACRIFICE WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST WHEN THEY OPEN THE 2015 SEASON SATURDAY. THESE KIDS GIVE A LOT OF EFFORT AND THEY GIVE A LOT OF THEMSELVES FOR THE PROGRAM, SAID LACEY, THE ORGANIZATIONS PRESIDENT. PEOPLE DONT REALIZE THE AMOUNT OF DEDICATION THESE KIDS GIVE TO THEIR TEAM. WHEN WE STARTED PRACTICES JULY 20 AND TO THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST, THESE PLAYERS WERE OUT THERE PRACTICING TWO HOURS A NIGHT, FIVE DAYS A WEEK. SOME OF THESE KIDS HAD TO MAKE WEIGHT REQUIREMENTS, THEY WENT ON DIETS AND THEY HAD TO GET THEMSELVES READY FOR THE SEASON. ...IM REALLY PROUD OF ALL OF THE KIDS WHO HAVE COME OUT. THIS SEASON, THE ORGANIZATION WILL FIELD ONE TEAM EACH IN THE GREMLIN, JUNIOR GREMLIN, JUNIOR MIDGET AND PEE-WEE DIVISIONS. BOTH OUR JUNIOR MIDGETS AND PEE-WEES TEAMS SHOULD BE VERY GOOD THIS YEAR, LACEY SAID. IN FACT, THE KIDS THAT HAVE PLAYED PEE-WEES HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS. SO, THEY ARE A SOLID GROUP OF KIDS. LAST SEASON, TWO GLADIATORS TEAMS CAPTURED SAN GABRIEL VALLEY JUNIOR ALL-AMERICAN FOOTBALL CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIPS. THE JUNIOR PEE-WEES SECURED A TITLE WITH A 20-7 VICTORY AGAINST THE PASADENA PANTHERS AND FINISHED THE SEASON WITH A 9-1 RECORD. THE MIDGETS WERE ABLE TO PULL OUT A 28-26 WIN AGAINST THE WEST COVINA BRUINS AND POSTED A 9-1 RECORD, AS WELL. WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE SOME VERY DEDICATED KIDS IN OUR PROGRAM, LACEY SAID. I THINK THEYRE READY FOR THE SEASON. FOOTBALL IS A VERY TOUGH SPORT. BUT ITS ALSO THE ULTIMATE TEAM SPORT IN THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO CONTRIBUTE. A LOT OF PARENTS ASK ME, WHY FOOTBALL? WHY NOT SOME OTHER SPORT? I THINK THE ONE THING, APART FROM THE COMMITMENT, THAT FOOTBALL TEACHES, ESPECIALLY WITH THE YOUTH PLAYERS, IS SELF-DISCIPLINE. THE REALITY IS THAT IF YOU CAN BE ON THAT FIELD, WITH THE ADRENALINE PUMPING, IN A PHYSICAL GAME AND YOU CAN CONTROL YOURSELF, YOU CAN CONTROL YOURSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. ORGANIZED IN 1968, THE GLADIATORS ARE MEMBERS OF THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY CONFERENCE OF JUNIOR ALL-AMERICAN FOOTBALL. THE ORGANIZATION IS OPEN TO BOYS AND GIRLS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 6-14 WHO PLAY ON TEAMS ORGANIZED ACCORDING TO AGE AND WEIGHT GUIDELINES. THE SQUADS TAKE PART IN EIGHT TO 10 GAMES A SEASON AGAINST TEAMS FROM NEARLY 30 CITIES IN THE CONFERENCE. THE GLADIATORS HAVE TRADITIONALLY SERVED TO PREPARE PLAYERS WHO HAVE GONE ON TO COMPETE FOR HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS LIKE LA CAADA, ST. FRANCIS, LOYOLA, FLINTRIDGE PREP, CRESCENTA VALLEY AND PASADENA POLY. THIS IS MY 11TH YEAR BASICALLY COACHING WITH THE GLADIATORS AND I HAVE A THIRD CHILD IN THE PROGRAM, GREMLINS COACH KEENEN CHUNG SAID. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE GUY I COACH WITH, MIKE MCCONNELL, HIM AND I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS TOGETHER FOR THAT MANY YEARS. WE WERE JUST TALKING THE OTHER DAY ABOUT HOW GREAT ITS BEEN. ON OUR OLDER TEAM, WE HAD 16 GUYS THAT WENT ON TO PLAY VARSITY FOOTBALL IN HIGH SCHOOL. WE HAVE A KID PLAYING NOW FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, ONE AT CORNELL, TWO AT [GLENDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE] AND MANY WHO HAVE GONE ON TO STUDY IN COLLEGE. ITS JUST GREAT TO SEE WHAT KIND OF INFLUENCE THIS PROGRAM HAS HAD ON THE KIDS. AND A LOT OF THEM THAT I SEE, STILL CALL ME COACH AND THEY STILL REMEMBER THE GAMES AND THE EXPERIENCES. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE ORGANIZATION IS THAT IT REQUIRES ALL PARTICIPANTS TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM 2.0 GRADE-POINT AVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE SEASON AND THOSE ATHLETES ATTAINING A 3.3 GPA OR GREATER ARE AWARDED A SCHOLAR-ATHLETE PATCH AT THE END OF THE SEASON.
515	IN A BREAK FROM THEIR NORMAL ROAD, CROSS COUNTRY AND TRAIL RUNS, THE GADE VALLEY HARRIERS CHALLENGED THEMSELVES IN THE CLUBS MAGIC MILE EVENT. THE ATHLETES SPILT INTO TWO GROUPS, WHO RACED FOR ONE MILE AROUND THE ATHLETICS TRACK AT JARMAN PAR. BEFORE THE RACES, EACH RUNNER HAD TO GUESS WHAT THEIR FINISHING TIME WOULD BE AND WERE GIVEN PENALTY POINTS FOR EACH SECOND THEY WERE OUT. AT THE END OF THE RACES, THE PENALTY POINTS WERE ADDED UP BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES, WITH THE TEAM HAVING THE LOWEST SCORE WINNING THE CAPTAINS CUP WHICH THIS YEAR THE MEN WON BY A NARROW MARGIN. IN ANOTHER GVH CLUB RACE, THURSDAY SAW THE LAST IN THE SERIES OF FIVE SUMMER HANDICAP RUNS. THE RUNNERS WERE SET OFF ROUND A 4.1-MILE LOOP ACCORDING TO THEIR SPEED, WITH THE SLOWEST PREDICTED RUNNER SETTING OFF FIRST AND BEING GIVEN A HEAD START BEFORE THE NEXT RUNNER PURSUES THEM THE IDEA BEING THAT ALL RUNNERS FINISH AT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME. THE COMPLICATED POINTS SYSTEM WAS COMPILED FROM THE FIVE RACES, AND THE WINNER WILL BE ANNOUNCED AT THE GADE VALLEY AGM MEETING LATER THIS MONTH.  WENDLEKEN TOOK ON HIS FAVOURITE SPRINT DISTANCE RACE, WHICH INVOLVES A 750M SWIM, A 20KM BIKE RIDE AND A 5KM RUN, FINISHING IN A TOTAL TIME OF 1:19:36 AND ACHIEVING SECOND PLACE IN HIS AGE GROUP. BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY SAW HARRIER RUSS BAILEY COMPETING IN THE HARWELL HALF MARATHON IN DIDCOT, OXFORDSHIRE. BAILEY COMPLETED THE 13.1-MILE COURSE IN 2:09:05 AS  PART OF HIS TRAINING FOR THE BERLIN MARATHON ON SEPTEMBER 27.  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE "SWIMMING IN INK" EVENT, STAPLES WILL ALSO PROVIDE "PRINT  ALL YOU WANT" DAYS 2 ON EPSON ECOTANK PRINTERS IN 16 STORES ACROSS THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA ON SEPT. CROSSING THE POND TO THE USA WAS PETER TUCKER WHO RAN THE CENTRAL PARK RUN FOR LIFE IN NEW YORK. TUCKER BRAVED THE HEAT TO FINISH THE 8KM RACE IN A RESPECTABLE 48:35. A GOOD TURNOUT AT THE BLACK PARK PARKRUN ON SATURDAY SAW SEVEN HARRIERS COMPETING WITH 462 OTHER RUNNERS. MATT ASHBY WAS FIRST HOME FOR THE HARRIERS IN A SPEEDY 19:16, FINISHING IN FIFTH POSITION OVERALL.  NEXT BACK WERE STEVE NEWING 20:12, PAULA COOK 26:45, CLAIRE NEWING 34:54 (PB), ALICE COOK 36:25 (PB) AND JENNY BARNETT 36:26.  AIPAC ISN'T IN THE BUSINESS OF OPPOSING ISRAELI GOVERNMENT POSITIONS. GADEBRIDGE PARKRUN HAD SIX GADE VALLEY HARRIERS FLYING THEIR COLOURS, WHERE JULIAN SMITH STORMED HOME IN THIRD OVERALL PLACE IN A TIME OF 20:32. SMITH WAS FOLLOWED BY JOHNNY BROOM IN A NEW PB OF 22:20, EMMA PHILLPOT 24:48 (PB), MARTIN STORRIE 25:10, ANDY BISHOP 25:24 AND ANDY NORTON 28:33.  LEFT BEHIND WITH NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT OR INFORMATION ON SOFTWARE. IN LUTON, HARRIERS HELEN HEATHCOTE AND CAROL SKATES TOOK ON THEIR 5KM PARKRUN, WITH HEATHCOTE CROSSING THE LINE IN 29:47 AND TEAM-MATE SKATES IN 33:38. ANTHONY JAMES FROM GVH CHARGED ROUND THE ST ALBANS COURSE TO SET A NEW PB OF 18:20, CLAIMING EIGHTH PLACE.  HAVE YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SHARE ON THE STORY? WERE YOU THERE?

516	ARCHIVED ONTARIO DOCTORS WARN THAT PATIENTS WILL HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CUTTING THEIR FEES. THE GOVERNMENT IS CHOPPING FEES BY 1.3 PER CENT STARTING NEXT WEEK TO KEEP THE PROFESSION WITHIN AN ALLOTTED $11.6-BILLION BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. DR.  THE FACT THAT EVEN WHERE IT IS PATENTLY CLEAR THAT DEATH IS NO PUNISHMENT, FOR A SUICIDE BOMBER PRESUMPTIVELY EMBRACES THAT IDEA, THE PUNISHMENT SOUGHT IS THE DEATH SENTENCE REVEALS THAT IT HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH DETERRENCE.  LAST MONTH, 82% OF ECONOMISTS THOUGHT THE FED WOULD RAISE RATES IN SEPTEMBER. MICHAEL TOTH, PRESIDENT OF THE ONTARIO MEDICAL ASSOCIATION , SAYS THE PROFESSION IS FRUSTRATED AND SOME MEMBERS ARE TALKING ABOUT LEAVING THE PROVINCE OR RETIRING EARLY. "IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PATIENTS ULTIMATELY," HE WARNED, NOTING THAT SOME PHYSICIANS WILL BE FORCED TO LAY OFF STAFF AND CUT OFFICE BUDGETS.  TACK OPTIMIZED BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY: TOBA TRIAL 12 MONTH RESULTS. PHYSICIANS ARE VENTING THEIR ANGER ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ON TWITTER , HARDLINERS ARE THREATENING JOB ACTION SUCH AS A WORK-TO-RULE CAMPAIGN, HOUR CUTBACKS AND CANCELLATION OF FLU-SHOT CLINICS.  CONSUMERS CAN OBTAIN NEWS RELEASE AND RECALL INFORMATION AT WWW.CPSC.GOV , ON TWITTER @USCPSC OR BY SUBSCRIBING TO CPSC'S FREE E-MAIL NEWSLETTERS . TOTH SAID THE OMA, WHICH REPRESENTS 28,000 MEMBERS, WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH GOVERNMENT AND IS CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION. HEALTH MINISTER ERIC HOSKINS SAID HE WANTS TO REASSURE ONTARIANS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERVICE CUTS. "MY CONCERN IS THAT A PERCEPTION IS BEING PROPAGATED THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE CHALLENGING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE FACTS SIMPLY DON'T BEAR THIS OUT," HE SAID.  ALL THATS CREATED A NEW PUSH FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTO MECHANIZATION TO REPLACE THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT FARMERS HAVE AN INCREASINGLY HARD TIME FILLING. ONTARIO DOCTORS ARE AMONG THE BEST PAID IN CANADA WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF ABOUT $350,000, AN AMOUNT THAT HAS GROWN BY 60 PER CENT OVER THAT LAST DECADE, HOSKINS SAID. FROM THAT, PHYSICIANS PAY OVERHEAD COSTS, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE WAGES AND OFFICE RENT, AN AMOUNT WIDELY QUOTED AS ABOUT 30 PER CENT.  I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD." THE RIFT DATES BACK TO A PAYMENT SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT UNILATERALLY IMPOSED LAST JANUARY AFTER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OMA ENDED IN AN IMPASSE. IT INCLUDED A 2.65 PER CENT FEE CUT AND A CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IF DOCTORS' OHIP BILLINGS WERE TAKING DOCTORS OVER THEIR $11.6-ALLOTMENT. THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENT MODEL ALLOWS DOCTORS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPENSATION. IF THEY SEE MORE PATIENTS AND PERFORM MORE PROCEDURES, THEY CAN BILL THE PUBLIC INSURANCE PLAN FOR MORE MONEY. THE PAYMENT SCHEME ALSO INCLUDES INCREASES OF 1.25 PER CENT IN THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES BUDGET FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  BUT ITS DEFINITELY GOOD TO GET COMFORTABLE AND SEE WHATS GOING ON. THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE ANNUAL INCREASES ARE INTENDED TO MEET A RISE IN DEMAND FROM A GROWING AND AGING POPULATION AND THE ADDITION OF 700 NEW DOCTORS. BUT THE OMA CONTENDS INCREASES OF 2.7 PER CENT ARE NEEDED IN EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND GROWTH.  IF YOU FEEL YOU ARE CURRENTLY SUBSCRIBED PLEASE CLICK ON THE BUTTON TO ATTEMPT TO FIND YOUR ACCOUNT.  ECT IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY ACCEPTED TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION, AND, IN FACT, IS BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR SEVERE DEPRESSION THERE IS. THE OMA IS LOBBYING MPPS, HOLDING TOWN HALL MEETINGS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE PROVINCE AND STAGING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH MEMBERS NEXT WEEK. TOTH ARGUED THERE IS A "POWER IMBALANCE" WITH GOVERNMENT AND CALLED FOR A NEUTRAL THIRD-PARTY TO WEIGH IN WITH A BINDING DECISION: "WE ARE LOOKING TO RESOLVE THIS ... WE THINK THE WAY TO DO THIS IS MEDIATION-ARBITRATION."
517	THAT GAME YOU USED TO PLAY IS GETTING A FULL-LENGTH FEATURE AND THE TRAILER GIVES US A FIRST LOOK AT FAVOURITE CHARACTERS LIKE NAMELESS RED BIRD AND BLACK BLOWY-UP BIRD ANGRY BIRDS IS THE RED-HOT IPHONE APP OF THE MOMENT. ITS LITERALLY A ONE-IN-A-MILLION SENSATION. YOUR STOP PLAYING IT.  LARGEST STAKE WNITH OWNERSHIP OF 210,916 SHARES AS OF Q2 2015 FOR 8.37% OF THE WORLDS EDGIEST COMEDIANS CANT STOP REFERENCING IT AND NOW ITS HEADING TO THE BIG SCREEN! WHAT SORT OF BLOCKBUS OH, HANG ON, MY FAULT, SORRY. I THOUGHT IT WAS 2012. LET ME START AGAIN. ANGRY BIRDS IS THAT IPHONE GAME THAT PEOPLE USED TO PLAY A LOT THREE YEARS AGO BUT DONT ANY MORE. AND NOW ITS GOING TO BE A FILM. AND THERES A TRAILZER FOR IT. THERE, THATS BETTER.  WE ASK IF OUR PHOTOGRAPHER CAN FILM OUT OF AS ZWE PASS THE ROLLING FIELDS THAT WILL SOON BE READY TO HARVEST. STILL, WHILE WERE HERE, LETS GIVE THE ANGRY BIRDS TRAILER A CLOSER LOOK. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST WE OPEN WITH A SHOT OF THE CHARACTER WERE MOST LIKELY TO REMEMBER FROM THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED ANGRY BIRDS SEVERAL YEARS AGO NAMELESS RED BIRD. HERES NAMELESS RED BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. THIS IS A FILM ABOUT A CARTOON BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. PINTEREST ALSO PRESENT, THREE SEXY BIRDS. AT LEAST I ASSUME THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY. GOD, I HOPE THEY ARE, OTHERWISE IVE JUST PROJECTING A HORRIFIC AMOUNT OF ONTO THREE RELATIVELY GENDER-FREE CARTOON BIRDS. NOT THIS WEEK, HERITAGE. DONT DO THIS WHILE NEBULOUS ALMOST-BESTIALITY IS SUCH A GET IT TOGETHER.  IN STYLE SPECIFICATION LITTLE IS FOUND WANTING AND WHILE THE SPECIFICATION IS MASSIVE (LEATHER UPHOLSTERY, SBREVERSING CAMERA, ELECTRIC DRIVERS SEAT, CRUISE CONTROL, THREE ZONE CLIMATE CONTROL AND ALL THAT CONNECTIVITY STUFF TODAYS PUNTERS DEMAND), IT IS APPARENT TOO THAT ?SKODA HAS UPPED THE ANTE ON THE DCOR FRONT, WHAT WITH AMBIENT LIGHTING NOW COMING AS PART OF THE DEAL. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, PHEW, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY AFTER ALL. AND THEY WERE AIMING ALL THEIR RED-HOT SEXUALITY AT THAT HUNKY SORT-OF BLUEISH BIRD.  FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST AH. HE DID. AND BY THE LOOK OF IT HE HASNT TAKEN THE REJECTION WELL.  SOME ANALYSTS SUGGEST CHINA'S ECONOMIC WEAKENING AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT U.S. IN FACT, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT HES NOW A FAIRLY ANGRY BIRD. SEE WHAT I DID THERE? THAT WAS CLEVER OF ME WASNT IT? SO ANGRY IS NAMELESS RED BIRD, IN FACT, THAT HE APPEARS TO HAVE ENROLLED IN SOME SORT OF ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME, ALONG WITH AN ANNOYING YELLOW BIRD PLAYED BY THE ANNOYING MAN WHO PLAYED THE ANNOYING SNOWMAN IN FROZEN.  JUST DAYS AFTER THE MSOE DOUBLE DUAL, LU TRAVELED TO ELMHURST COLLEGE IN ILLINOIS FOR A TWO-DAY INVITATIONAL. TYPECASTING ISSUES ASIDE, THOUGH, THIS LITERALLY SEEMS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE A FILM ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. THATS LITERALLY WHAT THIS FILM IS.  ANDERSON SHOULD BE IN FOR A SIMILARLY SPECTAFCULAR SEASON. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR THE BLACK BLOWY-UP UP BIRD IS ALSO ANGRY, BECAUSE HES JUST BLOWN UP. WOW, THESE PEOPLE HAVE REALLY GRABBED THE WHOLE ANGRY BIRDS IDEA BY ITS MOST LITERAL END AND RUN WITH IT, HAVENT THEY? FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST BUT ITS OK, BECAUSE HERES A PIG, WHICH YOU MIGHT REMEMBER IS THE MORTAL ENEMY OF THE ANGRY BIRDS. PRETTY SOON THESE PIGS WILL BE CONSTRUCTING DANGEROUSLY RAMSHACKLE THEMSELVES, AND THE BIRDS WILL KAMIKAZE IENTO THEM AS REVENGE. IF MY MEMORY IS CORRECT, THE BIRDS ALL DIE AS SOON AS THEYVE BEEN CATAPULTED AT THE PIGS, WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE WILL ACTUALLTY TURN UP TO BE A SORROWFUL MEDITATION ON THE FUTILITY OF WAR.  SMEDLEY APPEARED IN FIVE GAMES WITH BOWLING GREENL EARLIER THIS HALF AS A RESERVE CATCHER. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, WRONG AGAIN. ITS JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE IS LITERALLY TO BE ABOUT SOME BIRDS WHO GET ANGRY SOMETIMES. HOPEFULLY CLEAR FLAWS WILL ALL BE ADDRESSED IRONED OUT BY THE TIME THEY MAKE A FILM ABOUT YOUR SECOND-FAVOURITE IPHONE APP, GOOGLE MAPS.
518	A WOMAN WAS ARRESTED AT HER GYNECOLOGISTS OFFICE AFTER BEING IDENTIFIED AS AN UNDOCUMENTED MEXICAN IMMIGRANT. SHE HAD COME TO THE CLINIC SEEKING A ROUTINE CHECKUP; NOW SHE IS BEING HELD IN A TEXAS DETENTION CENTER ON A $35,000 BOND. ACCORDING TO THE HOUSTON PRESS, BLANCA BORREGO VISITED THE NORTHEAST WOMENS HEALTHCARE CLINIC IN ATASCOCITA, TEXAS ONE YEAR AFTER HER DOCTOR LOCATED AN ABDOMINAL CYST THAT HAD BEEN GIVING HER SIGNIFICANT PAIN. HER VISA 12 YEARS EXPIRED, SHE PROVIDED THE CLINIC STAFF WITH A FAKE ID AND WAS EVENTUALLY CALLED INTO AN EXAMINATION ROOM. HER DAUGHTER, WHO WISHES TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, TOLD THE HOUSTON PRESS THAT POLICE SOON [MARCHED] HER MOTHER OUT OF THE CLINIC...HER 8-YEAR-SISTER STARTED TO CRY WHEN SHE SAW THE HANDCUFFS. ONE OF THE DEPUTIES CARRYING OUT THE ARREST TOLD BORREGOS DAUGHTER THAT HER MOTHER WOULD BE DEPORTED. SHE HAS THUS REMAINED IN JAIL BECAUSE HER FAMILY FEARS AN IMMIGRATION DETAINER MIGHT KEEP HER IN LOCKUP REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH MONEY THEY PAY. IN THE MEANTIME, CLARISSA GUAJARDO, BORREGOS LAWYER, SUSPECTS THAT THIS ARREST VIOLATES HIPAA, FEDERAL LAWS PRESERVING PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY: ADVERTISEMENT THEY TOOK HER INTO THAT EXAMINATION ROOM SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING ARRESTED ...I JUST HAVE A VERY HARD TIME WITH THAT. I THINK ITS A VIOLATION OF HIPAA LAWS...ITS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET MEDICAL CARE...IT WASNT LIKE SHE WAS GETTING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE, EVEN. SHE HAD AN ESTABLISHED DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT GYNECOLOGIST. EXEMPTIONS TO HIPAA DO EXIST FOR EXAMPLE, PHYSICIANS WILL REPORT PATIENTS WHO SEEM TO BE DANGERS TO THEMSELVES. HOWEVER, GUAJARDO DOUBTS SUCH EXEMPTIONS APPLY TO CLINIC STAFF WHO SUSPECT A PATIENT OF BEING UNDOCUMENTED OR PRESENTING A FAKE ID. MEANWHILE, THE BORREGO FAMILY STRUGGLES TO MAKE ENDS MEET: HER HUSBAND, CONCERNED THAT HE WILL BE REPORTED AS WELL, NO LONGER WORKS. BORREGOS DAUGHTER HAS AN EXPIRED WORK VISA, A CRITICAL OBSTRUCTION TO PROVIDING FOR HER FATHER AND SIBLINGS. THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY THAT BORREGO WILL, ULTIMATELY, BE GRANTED LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS, BUT THAT DEPENDS ON THE OUTCOME OF HER CASE. IF SHE IS CONVICTED OF A FELONY, SHE WILL LIKELY BE FORCED TO RETURN TO MEXICO. CONTACT THE AUTHOR AT RACHEL.VORONA.COTE@JEZEBEL.COM. IMAGE VIA GETTY.

520	REVISED. KR: RIGHT, THE FETUS CONSTANTLY ADAPTS TO THE WOMB ENVIRONMENT AND PAYS THE PRICE FOR IT. THE FIRST ORDER IS SURVIVE AT ALL COSTS. THEN IF WERE FORTUNATE LATER, POSSIBLY THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO GO BACK AND TAKE CARE OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS, AND ALSO ITS THE LAST THING WE WAN TO DO. NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL THEIR PAIN, NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL TERROR OR ANYTHING UNPLEASANT REALLY. THATS WHAT OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE ABOUT, DISTRACTING OURSELVES IN A THOUSAND WAYS FROM ALL THIS PAIN WERE CARRYING AROUND, WHICH KEEPS RELENTLESSLY SURGING TO BE MADE CONSCIOUS.  THEY GET A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO FAIL AND KEEP FAILING AND THEN GROW AND HAVE SOME SUCCESSES AND GET CONSISTENT WITH IT." STRUCH HAD SOME HIGH PRAISE FOR FREADRICH, COMPARING HIM TO AN NHL DRAFT PICK AND FORMER PATS CAPTAIN. DR. JANOV WRITES, THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUM WHILE BEING CARRIED AND IN CHILDHOOD DIE IN AVERAGE TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THOSE RISK FACTORS.  THE MEETING WAS ADDRESSED VIA CONFERENCE CALL BY NUP LEADER AL-SADIG AL-MAHDI, NCF CHAIRMAN, FAROUK ABU ISSA, AMIN MAKKI MADANI, HEAD OF THE ALLIANCE OF THE SUDANESE CIVIL ORGANISATIONS AND GAHZI SALAH AL-DIN ATTABANI THE LEADER OF THE REFORM NOW MOVEMENT (RNM), A SPLINTER FACTION OF THE RULING PARTY. SO HERE THIS IS A GOOD ARGUMENT, FOR UNDERSTANDING AND RELIVING AND FEELING OUR PAIN, AND POSSIBLY EVEN HEALING BIG SECTIONS OF OUR HEARTS AND SOULS THAT ARE THERE WAS AN OLD BOOK THAT HE WROTE CALLED PRISONERS OF PAIN. THAT WERE  ALL KIND OF HUGGED TIED BY OUR PAIN AND THE REPRESSION THAT WE USE TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT. JL: RIGHT, AND I THINK THIS CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF AFFECTS TOO IN TERMS OF HOW WE REPRESS OR HOW WE TRY TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE JUST AS BAD IF WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DIG PAST THE PAIN OR REPRESS IT THAT CREATES ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM, WHICH CAN THEN SHOW UP IN OTHER WAYS. THERE HASNT BEEN A LOT OF DEFINITIVE RESEARCH ON THIS, BUT DR. JANOV REALLY BELIEVES THAT THIS ALSO MAY BE BEHIND WHAT EVENTUALLY CAUSES CANCER, THIS SORT OF MASSIVE REPRESSION ON THE CELLULAR LEVEL THAT PREVENTS NATURAL GROWTH AND THEN OVERTIME CREATES CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES. KR: ID LIKE TO READ ANOTHER SHORT SECTION HERE, DR. JANOV WRITES, WHAT MOST OF MEDICINE AND PSYCHOTHERAPY INVOLVES TODAY IS THE TREATMENT OF FRAGMENTS OF THE HUMAN BEING. WE THEN GO ABOUT TREATING THE VARIED OFFSHOOTS FROM A CENTRAL IMPRINT, RATHER THAN THE IMPRINT ITSELF. TREATMENT BECOMES INTERMINABLE, WHAT WE GET IS A FRAGMENT OF PROGRESS, A CHANGE IN ASPECTS OF AN EARLY EXPERIENCE, RATHER THAN A HOLISTIC RECALIBRATION OR NEURO AND PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS CONNECTED WITH THE EXPERIENCE. JL: RIGHT. I THINK THATS REALLY TO KIND OF TAKE THAT AND KIND OF GO TIED IN WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYING COMPARISONS HE DRAWS IN THE BOOK TO SOMEBODY LIKE FREUD, THE RELATIONSHIP HE HAS WITH SOME OF THE EARLIER SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT PRECEDED HIM IS COMPLICATED. FREUD HE HAD THIS NOTION THAT HYSTERIA WAS ROOTED IN REPRESSED SEXUAL DESIRE AND HE OFTEN CHARTED IT IN DREAMS AND SORT OF THIS SYMBOLIC NOTION OF DREAMS. I THINK WHAT JANO REALLYDOES IS HE TAKES, MUCH LIKE THOSE I THINK, THINKERS WHO DWELLED IN BIG IDEAS AND SORT OF PROFOUND CONCLUSIONS, HE SORT OF NOTES THAT WHILE FREUD WAS WORKING ON THE SYBOLIC LABELS AND MISSED A LOT, HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS. INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOW THIS HYSTERIA WOULD CONSTANTLY BE UNREFLECTIVE AND PRONE TO OVERREACTION, AND JANOV WOULD SAY THAT YES THESE TRAITS EXIST, BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR SYMBOLS IN DREAMS, HELL LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF WHATS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN WERE HAVING NIGHTMARES. WHATS HAPPENING TO US BIOLOGICALLY WHEN WE HAVE A NIGHTMARE, OR WHAT DO WE FEEL DURING THAT TIE, AND WHY IS THAT TERROR COMING UP. HEL LOOK TO THE LIMBIC SYSTEM TO FIND WHERE THE TERROR IS ACTUALLY ROOTED. HES NOT TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THATS GOING TO CALM DOWN A PATIENT WHO HAS ADD OR DEPRESSION FOR THE DAY OR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. EVEN SOMETHING THAT MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO, HES REALLY LOOKING TO SOMETHING THAT CAN EVENTUALLY PROMOTE A CURE. KR: IM GOING TO READ ONE MORE PARAGRAPH OK? ON MY END DR. JANOV WRITES, BRAIN WE NEED TO ADDRESS DOESNT TALK, DOESNT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT DOESNT UNDERSTAND WORDS. IN FACT, THE TERM UNDERSTAND IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER, WE ARE NOT AFTER UNDERSTANDING IN THE INTELLECTUAL SENSE OF THE TERM, WE ARE AFTER INTEGRATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT CEREBRAL UNDERSTANDING. YES, UNDERSTANDING HELPS, BUT IT MUST NOT BE CONFUSED WITH RESOLVING, CONNECTING AND INTEGRATING. WHEN A THERPIST TRIES TO GET A PATIENT TO REPORT ON HIS FEELINGS ALL MAY BE LOST, FOR THOSE FEELINGS MAY BE WORDLESS. TRYING TO EXPRESS THEM VERBALLY DISTANCES US FROM THE ORIGINS OF OUR PAIN IN THE LOWER BRAIN, AND SINCE ONE LAYER OF BRAIN TISSUE CANNOT DO THE WORK OF ANOTHER WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY TRUMPED OR EFFORTS, ONCE WE GET AWAY FROM WORDS WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT IS CURATIVE. UNDERSTANDING CAME LAST IN HUMAN EVOLUTION, LONG AFTER FEELING, AND IT WILL NOT LEAD US TO THE LONG TERM HEALING WE ARE AFTER.  IM NOT DEFENDING THE SHOW UNTIL THEY SEE IT. NONE OF THIS REQUIRES ABSTRACT OR ESOTERIC METHODS, WE CAN MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN SOCIETY JUST BY PAYING ATTENTION TO GESTATION AND CHANGING OUR BIRTH PRACTICES. JL: RIGHT, AND I MEAN I THINK THATS ONE OF THE BOOKS KEY CONCLUSIONS, IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT BIRTH PRACTICES AND LOOK AT A MOTHERS EMOTIONAL STATE AS NOT JUST NOT AT ALL INCIDENTAL. I THINK THE IDEA THAT FEELING IS CONNECTED TO OUR BIOLOGY AND HAS THESE SORT OF BIOLOGIC IMPLICATIONS, WE CAN SEE IT IN OUR BIOLOGY IS A PRETTY DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE FIELD. A FIELD THAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY TALK THERAPY AND BY APPROACHES REALLY FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS, NOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN. THATS WHERE I THINK DR. JANOV IS REALLY LOOKING TO GO. KR: WELL, IT EXCITES ME BECAUSE I THINK IT OPENS A HUGE DOOR. I THINK IT OPENS AN ENORMOUS DOOR OF UNDERSTANDING AND OF SUGGESTING VERY FUNDAMENTAL, NONE ESOTERIC, AS HE SAYS, SIMPLE BIRTH PRACTICES, PRACTICES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILD BIRTHING THAT CAN HAVE THE MOST DRAMATIC AND FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR HUMAN FUTURE. IT CAN PROBABLY DO MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE BILLABLE HOURS IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROFESSION. JL: YES, I THINK THERE WAS A CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK THAT CAME ABOUT LATER SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH PREGNANCY, AND I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME WORKING WITH DR. JANOV IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND JUST KIND OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE CONSTANT INFLUX OF NEW IDEAS AND RESEARCH HE WAS EXPOSING ME TO AND ALL THE WORK THAT WAS BEING DONE, IN THE FIELD OF EPIGENETICS IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL HEALTH AND NEW STUDIES HE WAS SHOWING ME ABOUT MEMORY AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE OTHER TOPICS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK REALLY STUCK WA THIS IDEA ABOUT WHAT TO DO DURING PREGNANCY. AND HE ENDED UP SORT OF WRITING A CHAPTER ON PREGNANCY AND JUST OFFERING SOME ALMOST CONCRETE PIECES OF ADVICE FOR WOMEN THAT CAN HAVE SOME REALLY LASTING IMPLICATIONS. AS HE WRITES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OXYMORON FOR ME TO GIVE ADVICE SINCE I AM NOT BY PROFESSION NOR INTENTION AN AFICIONADO OF ADVICE. BUT LET US NOT MINIMIZE WHAT A CARRYING MOTHER CAN DO FOR THE GOOD OR BAD OF HER CHILD. IT IS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THAT HE APPROACHES THE SUBJECT, BECAUSE HE IS MALE AND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT IF YOURE SORT OF PROVIDING SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOW IT BEHAVED. BUT THINGS LIKE WATCHING YOUR STRESS; IF I CAN READ JUST A COUPLE PARTS OF THIS CHAPTER I THINK ITS REALLY IMPORTANT.  I AM MORE THAN COMFORTABLE IN HAVING BARTKOWSKI AT $1.75M A YEAR AS MY 3RD PAIRING DEFENDER, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE SBISA BETTER. THERE IS NO WAY TO ELIMINATE STRESS ENTIRELY, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS TO MANAGE IT. DONT PLAN A NEW BUSINESS OR START A SERIES OF COMPLICATED PROJECTS THAT PUT YOU UNDER STRESS WHILE PREGNANT. THE BABY WILL FEEL THIS ANXIETY AND SUFFER. TY TO WORK OUT PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SPOUSE BEFORE YOU GET PREGNANT. ONCE YOU ARE PREGNANT, IT IS LARGELY TOO LATE. THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD NEVER ARGUE OR FIGHT AGAIN; BUT TRY TO RESOLVE THE MORE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES BEFORE YOU ITRODUCE A NEW LIFE ON THIS PLANET. THE BABY DESERVES HIS OR HER BEST CHANCE AT LIFE, AND WHAT YOU DO DURING PREGNANCY TO MANAGE YOUR STRESS IS IMPORTANT, IN THAT REGARD. HE TALKS ABOUT EATING RIGHT AND GETTING PROTEIN, CALCIUM, FOLIC ACID, FIBER. HE TALKS ABOUT BEING VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GOING ABOUT TRANQUILIZERS AND PAINKILLERS TO RELIVE ANXIETY. NEW STUDIES ARE COMING OUT ALL THE TIME ON THIS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NEW STUDIES ON THE USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS, THE USE OF TRANQUILIZERS DURING PREGNANCY, AND WERE STILL KIND OF FIGURING OUT WHAT ALL THIS DOES, ULTIMATELY IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE MOTHER TO KEEP HER EMOTIONS BALANCED BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO SEE WHAT OTHER EFFECTS THIS COULD HAVE DURING GESTATION. I THINK THE MAIN THING HE FOCUSES ON ALL OF THIS IS LOVE. TO TOUCH YOUR BABY EARLY ON, TO BREASTFEED IF YOU CAN, HE SAYS, "READ FRENCH OBSTETRICIAN FREDERIC LEBOYER, WHO POPULARIZED THE PRACTICE OF IMMERSING THE NEWBORN IN A WARM WATER BATH, WITHOUT DRUGS AND WITHOUT BRIGHT LIGHTS. LEBOYER RECOMMENDS THAT THE  BABY BE HELD RIGHT AWAY AND FOR A LONG TIME. HE ADVISES AGAINST CUTTING THE UMBILICAL CORD TOO SOON AS THE CHILD'S ATTACHMENT WITH HIS MOTHER IS VITAL AT THE START OF LIFE." "THERE IS NO GREATER ADVICE I CAN GIVE THAN THIS: BE OPEN, EXPRESSIVE, AND FEELING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. A CARING MOTHER GIVES HER BABY THE BEST CHANCE FOR LONG-TERM WELL-BEING. YES, EVEN IF YOU DON'T EAT THOSE CARROTS AND TOMATOES WHEN YOU SHOULD, LOVE WILL HELP. YOUR CHILD IS PART OF YOU AND FEELS WHAT YOU FEEL, EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS IT. ALL I ASK IS AWARENESS. THE RESEARCH IS THERE; WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS ANYMORE." HE'S PUTTING IT OUT THERE, WE HAVE RESEARCH INTO THIS FIELD, WE CAN'T TURN A BLIND EYE TO IT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MEAN.
521	TAKING A GOOD PANORAMA IMAGE IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS. IN OUR OCTOBER 2015 MASTERCLASS WE TALK ABOUT STITCHING THE PERFECT PANORAMA. MOST OF THE TIME SOFTWARE SYSTEMS LIKE PHOTOSHOP CAN HANDLE STITCHING CORRECTLY, AND PRODUCE BEAUTIFUL VISTAS. OCCASIONALLY HOWEVER, THINGS GO WRONG. HAVE YOU EVER HAD A SERIES OF IMAGES WHERE THE LINES DONT MEET UP CORRECTLY, OR ANGLES REFUSE TO SYNC? MOST OF THE TIME WE HAVE TO DISCARD PANORAMAS LIKE THIS, OR GO THROUGH COMPLEX, TIME-CONSUMING EDITING PROCESSES TO GET A CLEAN, NATURAL-LOOKING IMAGE. LUCKILY, THIS PROBLEM CAN BE LARGELY ELIMINATEDBY UNDERSTANDING PARALLAX ERROR AND USING A PANORAMA HEAD ON YOUR TRIPOD. LAKE QUELLACOCHA, PERU LIES AT AN ALTITUDE OF 4350 METRES. IMAGE BY TEAGAN CUNNIFFE. FIRSTLY, WHAT IS PARALLAX ERROR? THIS EXERCISE IS ONE WAY TO UNDERSTAND IT: HOLD YOUR INDEX FINGER IN FRONT OF YOUR NOSE, AND THEN TAKE TURNS IN CLOSING ONE EYE, AND THEN THE OTHER. NOTICE HOW YOUR FINGER APPEARS TO MOVE?NEXT, KEEP BOTH EYES OPEN AND MOVE YOUR HEAD SLOWLY FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, KEEPING AN EYE ON THE BACKGROUND AND HOW YOUR FINGER SEEMS TO SHIFT IN RELATION TO IT.THATS PARALLAX ERROR. PARALLAX IS A DISPLACEMENT OR DIFFERENCE IN THE APPARENT POSITION OF AN OBJECT VIEWED ALONG TWO DIFFERENT LINES OF SIGHT, AND IS MEASURED BY THE ANGLE OR SEMI-ANGLE OF INCLINATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO LINES.NEARBY OBJECTS HAVE A LARGER PARALLAX THAN MORE DISTANT OBJECTS WHEN OBSERVED FROM DIFFERENT POSITIONS. IN PRACTICAL TERMS, THIS MEANS THAT WHEN YOU PANYOUR CAMERATO TAKE A SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS TO LATER STITCH INTO A PANORAMA, THE ACT OFSWEEPING YOUR LENS FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER CAUSES YOUR CAMERA TO RECORD DIFFERENT ANGLES TO A SINGLE OBJECT. WHEN IT COMES TO STITCHING, SOFTWARE CANT FILL IN THE GAPS AND LEAVES THAT PART OF THE IMAGE DISCONNECTED. THIS HAPPENS MAINLY WITH OBJECTS CLOSER TO YOUR LENS. THE EASIEST WAY TO FIX THIS IS BY FINDING YOUR CAMERAS NODAL POINT. THE NODAL POINTIS WHERE LIGHT RAYS ENTERING YOUR LENS CONVERGE AND YOUR CENTRE OF PERSPECTIVE IS FOUND. TO CONTROL FOR PARALLAX ERROR, YOULL NEED TO KEEP YOUR LENS IN A FIXED POSITION AND INSTEAD ROTATE YOUR CAMERA AROUND THE LENS. YOU WILL NEED A PANORAMA HEAD ON YOUR TRIPOD TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS PROPERLY. NOTICE HOW THE NODAL POINT, THE SPHERE OF LIGHT INTO THE LENS, STAYS IN THE SAME PLACE AS THE CAMERA IS ROTATED. THIS WILL GREATLY REDUCE PARALLAX ERROR. COURTESY JOHN PANOS . NODAL NINJA IS ONE OF THE LEADING BRANDS IN PANORAMA TRIPOD HEADS. YOU CAN BUY ONE HEREFOR R4950 . THERES ALSO A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE VIA SHARP VISION , WHICH SHIPS TO SA. THERE ARE EVEN A FEW DIY TUTORIALS ON MAKING YOUR OWN PANORAMA HEAD. SIMPLY HEAD TO GOOGLE , THEN TO YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE STORE TO START BUILDING YOUR OWN. ALREADY HAVE A PANORAMA HEAD AND WANT TO KNOW HOW TO CORRECTLY SET UP YOUR CAMERA TO FIND THE NODAL POINT?

522	EXPERIENCED STRIKER CHARLOTTE HARRISON IS BACK IN FAVOUR WITH THE NEW ZEALAND HOCKEY SELECTORS. EXPERIENCED STRIKER CHARLOTTE HARRISON IS BACK IN FAVOUR WITH THE NEW ZEALAND HOCKEY SELECTORS. STRIKER CHARLOTTE HARRISON IS AMONG A TRIO OF STARS WHO HAVE HAD THEIR OLYMPICS CHANCES BOOSTED BY BEING RECALLED TO THE BLACK STICKS WOMEN'S SQUAD. SHE IS JOINED BY FORMER CAPTAIN KAYLA WHITELOCK AND EXPERIENCED DEFENDER EMILY NAYLOR IN THE 24-PLAYER SQUAD NAMED BY COACH MARK HAGER. THOSE THREE PLAYERS INJECT 668 CAPS INTO AN ALREADY EXPERIENCED SQUAD FOR A HECTIC PLAYING SCHEDULE THROUGH TO DECEMBER. HAGER WILL THEN SELECT AN OLYMPIC SQUAD. "IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT SELECTION PROCESS WE HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH DUE TO THE QUALITY OF PLAYERS WE HAD. THE LEVEL WAS HIGH, THE TEAMS WERE CLOSE, AND THERE WAS SOME EXCEPTIONAL PLAY," HAGER SAID AS HE GAUGED FORM FROM THE JUST-COMPLETED NATIONAL LEAGUE. THE 26-YEAR-OLD HARRISON CAPPED A GOOD CAMPAIGN, HELPING AUCKLAND DEFEND THE TITLE. SHE HAS 183 CAPS AND SCORED 50 GOALS SINCE DEBUTING IN 2005, THOUGH SHE HAD FALLEN OUT OF FAVOUR IN RECENT TIMES. BUT HARRISON WON BACK THE CONFIDENCE OF HAGER. "SHE HAS THE CAPABILITY TO SCORE GOALS, SHE HAS GREAT GAME KNOWLEDGE, SHE READS THE GAME WELL AND OVERALL SHE ADDS REAL STRENGTH TO OUR FORWARD LINE," HAGER SAID. HARRISON IS THRILLED WITH HER RECALL AND THE CHANCE TO PUSH FOR ANOTHER OLYMPICS APPEARANCE. "IT'S PRETTY SPECIAL TO BE NAMED AFTER HAVING A COUPLE OF YEARS OFF, IT MADE ME MISS IT. IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK AND PLAYING ALONGSIDE SOME REALLY GOOD FRIENDS," HARRISON SAID. "I'VE STILL GOT SOME WORK TO DO ON MY FITNESS TO GET BACK TO THAT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, BUT I REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING LAST WEEK AND I THINK THAT FITNESS HELPED MY PERFORMANCE." THE BLACK STICKS FACE ARGENTINA IN FOUR GAMES DURING A SOUTH ISLAND TOUR THAT TAKES IN GAMES IN BLENHEIM, NELSON AND CHRISTCHURCH. THEY THEN HEAD TO STRATFORD FOR THE 2015 OCEANIA CUP BEFORE TAKING ON THE WORLD'S BEST AT THE FIH WORLD LEAGUE FINAL IN ARGENTINA IN DECEMBER. "WE HAVE GIVEN SOME NEW PLAYERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW THEY GO AGAINST ARGENTINA - ONE OF THE BEST TEAMS IN THE WORLD IT'S A HOME SERIES SO WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE OTHER PLAYERS A CHANCE," HAGER SAID. EIGHTEEN-YEAR OLD AUCKLAND DEFENDER MADDIE DOWE AND CAPITAL'S MIDFIELDER KELSEY SMITH HAVE BEEN INCLUDED FOR THE ARGENTINA SERIES. "BOTH THESE PLAYERS ARE VERY QUICK, AND HAVE GREAT ATHLETICISM. MADDIE COULD ADD SOME SPEED TO OUR DEFENSIVE LINE AND KELSEY IMPRESSED IN THE MIDFIELD AND HAS THE ABILITY TO SCORE GOALS. THEY HAVE THE CHANCE TO BE IN RIO, SO WE WILL SEE HOW THEY GO AGAINST ARGENTINA," HAGER SAID. BLACK STICKS SQUAD: GOALKEEPERS: GEORGIA BARNETT, AMELIA GIBSON, SALLY RUTHERFORD. DEFENDERS: SAM CHARLTON, NATASHA FITZSIMONS, PIPPA HAYWARD, KAT HENRY, ROSE KEDDELL, EMILY NAYLOR, BROOKE NEAL, LIZ THOMPSON.

523	IT STARTED LAST YEAR! THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND THEN THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARRIVING ON THE SHORES OF ITALY AND GREECE. THEY HAD HORRIBLE STORIES OF DEVASTATION, OF INDISCRIMINATE KILLINGS IN THEIR HOMELANDS, OF RAPES, AND OF THE COMPLETE DESOLATION OF THEIR HOMES, VILLAGES, AND TOWNS. MOREOVER THEY WERE HAPPY THAT THEY ARRIVED ON SOME EUROPEAN OR MEDITERRANEAN SHORE BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THEM, OTHERS NEVER MADE IT. THEY PERISHED IN TRANSIT. EUROPE OPENED ITS DOORS AND ITS SOCIAL SERVICES AND MANY OF THEM SETTLED IN THE COUNTRIES THAT WERE DOING BETTER ECONOMICALLY - IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY IN GREECE WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS GOING THROUGH ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES AND SO THE DESTINATION BECAME EITHER GERMANY OR SWEDEN. IN SOTTO VOCE, OR A WHISPER, WE HEARD ABOUT INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS FROM IRAQ, SYRIA, AND AFGHANISTAN THAT WERE MAKING MONEY IN THE TRANSPORTATION OF THESE GROUPS OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA OR TRANSPORTING THEM ACROSS EUROPE. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, TRANSPORTATION LIKE THIS IS EASY BECAUSE THERE IS ALMOST AN ABSENCE OF BORDERS. TRAVEL AND EMPLOYMENT WERE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE. THEN THIS SUMMER, THE NUMBERS CHANGED. THE HUNDREDS BECAME THOUSANDS AND THE THOUSANDS BECAME TENS OF THOUSANDS. THE FRONTIERS SUDDENLY WERE FLOODED. OVER TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY WOULD CROSS A BORDER AND CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY ON FOOT, BY TRAIN, OR BY BUS. THE MULTITUDES TRAVELING ON FOOT WOULD SEEK THE SHORTEST DISTANCE TO GERMANY. THE PATHWAY WAS THROUGH GREECE, SERBIA, HUNGARY, AUSTRIA AND GERMANY. EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHICH ARE NOT A PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION STARTED TO WATCH THEIR BORDERS. THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT BECAME A PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS ARE THEMSELVES STRUGGLING WITH POVERTY, HOMELESSNESS, AND UNEMPLOYMENT. THEY HAVE NOT WELCOMED THE NEW IMMIGRANTS. THEN HUNGARY, THE MAIN TRANSITIONING COUNTRY, CREATED A BARBED WIRE FENCE. WHEN THIS WAS BROKEN, THE MILITARY WERE CALLED TO RESPOND AND PROTECT THE BORDER. AS A RESPONSE TO WHAT WAS CALLED HUNGARIAN BARBARITY, OTHER COUNTRIES ATTACKED HUNGARY IN THEIR MAJOR NEWSPAPERS. THE IMMIGRANTS WERE WELCOMED TO CROATIA, WHICH FOR TWO DAYS WELCOMED EVERYONE WHO COULD COME AND REGISTER THERE ON THE WAY TO GERMANY. UP NORTH, GERMANY HERSELF BECAME EXHAUSTED AND CLOSED ITS OWN BORDERS. THE WHOLE ISSUE IS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND THERE ARE MANY OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT THE REFUGEES HOPE TO FIND AND HOW THE REST OF THE WORLD SHOULD RECEIVE THEM. THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE ASKED WHY THE MUSLIM COUNTRIES ARE NOT RECEIVING THESE IMMIGRANTS - AFTER ALL, THEY ARE THEIR OWN BROTHERS. THEN THERE WAS A DECISION FOR EACH EUROPEAN COUNTRY TO TAKE A NUMBER OF REFUGEES BASED ON THEIR POPULATION, BUT THAT DECISION WAS NOT RECEIVED WELL. OTHERS ARE SAYING THAT THE LAWS THAT WERE CREATED FOR IMMIGRANTS AT THE END OF WORLD WAR II WERE PRIMARILY FOR POLITICAL REFUGEES, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME WITHIN THE LAST YEAR CAME PRIMARILY BECAUSE EUROPE IS PROVIDING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SERVICES THAT THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET IN THEIR COUNTRIES. THEN THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT THE ARRIVAL OF MILLIONS OF MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS WILL SPEED THE ISLAMIZATION OF EUROPE AND SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ONLY ACCEPT SYRIAN CHRISTIANS. COUNTRIES SUCH AS SERBIA, MACEDONIA, AND MONTENEGRO ARE AFRAID TO ALLOW IMMIGRANTS IN SINCE KOSOVO BECAME A NEW COUNTRY AND THEY ARE AFRAID OF AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN ALBANIA AND KOSOVO WHICH COULD SWALLOW UP TERRITORIES THAT ARE BEING POPULATED BY MOSLEMS. OTHERS IN GERMANY ARE SAYING THAT THE NEW ARRIVALS DO NOT INTEGRATE. INSTEAD THEY DICTATE THINGS TO THE PEOPLE ALREADY LIVING THERE, AS IN THE CASE OF THE IMAMS ASKING GERMAN SCHOOLS TO RECONSIDER THE DRESS CODE OF THE GERMAN GIRLS SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT TEMPT THE MUSLIM BOYS. THERE ARE POLITICIANS AND ECONOMISTS WHO ARE TELLING US THAT THE SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND THE COMPASSION EXHIBITED BY EUROPE WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEY TELL US THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT IN EUROPE BEING ABLE TO HANDLE THE SITUATION, BUT WITH THE SYSTEMS AND THE GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THE WELFARE OF THEIR PEOPLE. THEY TELL US THAT AS LONG AS POVERTY AND THESE INDISCRIMINATE WARS CONTINUE, ONE PART OF THE WORLD WILL HAVE THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF IMMIGRANTS. THIS MORNING, I RECEIVED AN EMAIL ABOUT A CHURCH LEADER IN SOUTHERN EUROPE. THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE COMING TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP THIS SITUATION. MANY REMEMBER THAT BIBLE PASSAGE IN WHICH THE APOSTLES ASKED THE LORD JESUS CHRIST TO SEND THE MULTITUDES AWAY, BUT HE HAD COMPASSION ON THEM AND ASKED THEM TO SIT DOWN AND CREATED THAT MIRACLE OF MULTIPLYING THE BREAD FOR 5,000 PEOPLE. WHAT IS THE COMPASSIONATE ACTION NEEDED IN OUR DAY? THE HUMANITY AND DIGNITY OF EUROPE IS BEING TESTED IN HOW THEY REACT TO THIS MULTITUDE WHO HAS GREATLY SUFFERED AND WHO IN ANOTHER WAY WANT TO BENEFIT FROM THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE WESTERN WORLD. THE COMPASSION OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD IS BEING TESTED AS TO OUR WILLINGNESS TO GIVE NOT ONLY FROM OUR ABUNDANCE, BUT TO GIVE EVEN ABOVE IT, BECAUSE THESE ARE GOD'S CHILDREN.

526	THE 34-YEAR-OLD QUEENSLANDER BOWED OUT ON SUNDAY AFTER A 10-YEAR CAREER OF 59 TESTS PHOTO: AFP MELBOURNE: THE RETIREMENT OF ALL-ROUNDER SHANE WATSON ROBS TEST CRICKET OF ONE OF ITS MOST ENIGMATIC CHARACTERS, WHILE DEPRIVING AUSTRALIAN FANS OF THEIR FAVOURITE WHIPPING BOY IN THE RED-BALL GAME. THE 34-YEAR-OLD QUEENSLANDER BOWED OUT ON SUNDAY AFTER A 10-YEAR CAREER OF 59 TESTS, FEATURING 3,731 RUNS AT AN AVERAGE OF 35.19 AND 75 WICKETS AT 33.68. READ:AUSTRALIAS SHANE WATSON ANNOUNCES TEST RETIREMENT WATSON, WHO HAS NOT STEPPED DOWN FROM THE ONE-DAY AND TWENTY20 SIDES, CAN FURTHER BURNISH HIS CONSIDERABLE ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE SHORTER FORMATS OF THE GAME. BUT HIS RESPECTABLE, IF NOT SPECTACULAR, LEGACY IN TESTS WILL REMAIN A SOURCE OF DEBATE IN ASSESSING ONE OF THE GAMES MOST POLARISING PLAYERS. WATSONS BACKERS WILL REMEMBER A STOIC FIGURE WHO EKED A LOT FROM A CURSED BODY, FLASHED A GLORIOUS COVER DRIVE AND TOOK BAGS OF WICKETS ON FOREIGN PITCHES WITH METRONOMIC MEDIUM PACE. FANS CLOSER TO HOME WILL RECALL A CAREER THAT FELL INFURIATINGLY SHORT OF ITS ENORMOUS PROMISE. THERES A LOT THAT IM PROUD OF, WATSON SAID AFTER ANNOUNCING HIS DECISION. THE THING IM MOST PROUD OF IS IVE GIVEN EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN TO GET THE BEST OUT OF MYSELF. I HAVENT ACHIEVED CERTAINLY ALL THE THINGS I DREAMED OF ACHIEVING IN TEST CRICKET AVERAGE 50 WITH THE BAT AND IN THE 20S WITH THE BALL. THATS OBVIOUSLY THE DREAM AS AN ALL-ROUNDER TO ACHIEVE AND OBVIOUSLY I DIDNT GET ANYWHERE NEAR THAT, BUT I DO KNOW I GAVE IT EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BEST OUT OF MYSELF. BY ANY MEASURE, WATSON HAS BEEN A MAN OF CONTRADICTIONS, MANY OF THEM FRUSTRATING AND SOME QUITE HILARIOUS. SPORTING THE BARREL-CHESTED PHYSIQUE OF A SURF LIFE-SAVER, WATSON MADE HIS TEST DEBUT AGAINST PAKISTAN IN 2005, HAVING CUT HIS TEETH IN FIRST-CLASS CRICKET IN FRIGID TASMANIA, FAR FROM THE SUNNY BEACHES OF HIS NATIVE QUEENSLAND. HE FELL FLAT ON HIS FACE AFTER HIS OPENING DELIVERY AT THE SYDNEY CRICKET GROUND, BUT PICKED HIMSELF UP TO TAKE A WICKET AND SCORE A NERVOUS 31. HE WOULD PLAY ONLY TWO MORE TESTS BEFORE HIS SHOULDER GAVE WAY, SHUNTING HIM OUT OF THE SIDE FOR ANOTHER THREE YEARS. UPON HIS RETURN, HE QUICKLY ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS ONE OF THE COUNTRYS MOST IMPORTANT PLAYERS IN A TEAM BATTLING TO REBUILD AFTER THE RETIREMENTS OF A GOLDEN GENERATION OF PLAYERS. FALSE STARTS WHILE HIS BOWLING WAS COMMENDABLY TIGHT AND OFTEN PRODUCED BREAKTHROUGH WICKETS, HIS FOCUS AT THE CREASE WAS INCLINED TO WANDER. HE BECAME KNOWN AS A SQUANDERER OF STARTS, A REPUTATION THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY PROVE UNSHAKEABLE. IT WASNT UNTIL HIS 15TH TEST THAT HE WOULD FINALLY RAISE HIS BAT FOR A CENTURY, HAVING BEEN DROPPED ON 98 BY A PAKISTAN FIELDER IN THE 2009 BOXING DAY TEST IN MELBOURNE. HE WOULD SCORE ONLY THREE MORE TONS FROM HIS 109 INNINGS, THOUGH BUILDING PLATFORMS WITH 24 HALF-CENTURIES. ALTHOUGH A SHARP SLIP FIELDER, HIS RUNNING BETWEEN WICKETS WAS OFTEN LAMENTABLE, LEAVING BATTING PARTNERS FUMING AS THEY TRUDGED OFF AS CASUALTIES OF A WATSON-INDUCED MIX-UP. LATER IN HIS CAREER, HIS PADS SEEMED TO GROW TO EPIC PROPORTIONS AND OFFER THE EASIEST OF TARGET PRACTICE FOR ACCOMPLISHED SEAMERS SEEKING TO TRAP HIM LBW. WATSONS ENTHUSIASM FOR THE DECISION REVIEW SYSTEM WAS MATCHED ONLY BY HIS INEPTITUDE IN USING IT, AND YOUTUBE COMPILATIONS OF SOME OF HIS MOST FARCICAL APPEALS REMAIN IN HIGH CIRCULATION. THE INJURIES NEVER ABATED FOR LONG ENOUGH FOR WATSON TO BUILD MOMENTUM, AND HE GRADUALLY BECAME A PROBLEM. URGED TO SHELVE HIS BOWLING TO PRESERVE HIS BODY, HE FELL SHORT OF THE RUNS TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF AS A SPECIALIST BATSMAN. YET, HIS SEEMINGLY UNBREAKABLE HOLD OF HIS PLACE WITHIN THE TEAM WAS ONE OF THE BIGGER CURIOSITIES OF AUSTRALIAN CRICKET. CRITICS RAGED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND TALK-BACK RADIO IN HIS HOMELAND, BUT SELECTORS STUCK BY THEIR MAN THROUGH THICK AND THIN HOWEVER RARELY THEIR FAITH WAS REPAID. THE AXE FINALLY SWUNG IN JULY AFTER THE FIRST ASHES TEST IN ENGLAND WHERE THE SCORECARD SHOWED A FAMILIAR SIGHT FOR GROANING AUSTRALIANS WATSON TRAPPED LBW IN BOTH INNINGS AFTER MAKING STARTS. HE CUT A FORLORN FIGURE CARRYING THE DRINKS IN THE FINAL FOUR TESTS, WHICH SOMEHOW FELT POORER FOR THE LACK OF THE QUEENSLANDER. IF FAILING TO BRING RUNS OR WICKETS, WATSON COULD GENERALLY BE RELIED UPON TO DELIVER DRAMA OR COMEDY, AND HIS ABSENCE ROBS THE TEST ARENA OF ONE OF ITS MOST HUMAN ACTORS.
527	BY: NICHOLAS WEST, TECH SWARM | THE GLOBAL DRONE ARMS RACE CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE. NOW THAT ITS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION THAT EVERY COUNTRY WILL HAVE ARMED DRONES WITHIN 10 YEARS , THE ONLY RACE LEFT IS TO ACQUIRE THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPONIZED DRONES PREFERABLY COUPLED WITH THE MOST SOPHISTICATED ANTI-DRONE TECHNOLOGY . GENERAL ATOMICS AERONAUTICAL SYSTEMS, INC., OR GA ASI , THE SAN DIEGO-BASED COMPANY THAT MAKES THE PREDATOR AND REAPER DRONES, IS UNDERTAKING A PRIVATELY FUNDED STUDY TO INTEGRATE A 150-KILOWATT SOLID-STATE LASER ONTO ITS AVENGER (NE PREDATOR-C) DRONE. IF THE COMPANY SUCCEEDS, A DRONE WITH A HIGH-ENERGY LASER WILL BE A REALITY AT SOME POINT IN 2017, COMPANY EXECUTIVES TOLD DEFENSEONE. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE STANDARD WEAPONIZED DRONE IS OFTEN NOT AS ACCURATE AS IT IS TOUTED TO BE, RESULTING IN WIDESPREAD CIVILIAN CASUALTIES , THE VICE PRESIDENT OF MISSION SYSTEMS FOR GENERAL ATOMICS ADMITS THAT INTEGRATING LASER WEAPONS ONTO DRONE PLATFORMS INCREASES LETHAL POWER, BUT IS CURRENTLY THOUGHT TO BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THAN HELLFIRE MISSILES. IN ADDITION TO 5 TIMES THE POWER, THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BEAM QUALITY PROVIDES SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LETHALITY THAN THE SYSTEM ON THEPONCE. BRINGING THESE TWO TECHNOLOGIES TOGETHER INVOLVES A LOT MORE THAN STRAPPING A LASER CANNON UNDER THE DRONES WINGS. HITTING A TARGET WITH A LASER MOUNTED ON A VIBRATING PLATFORM MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH AIR LADEN WITH DUST AND WATER VAPOR IS TOUGHER THAN LAUNCHING A HELLFIRE AT A MOVINGVEHICLE. NEVERTHELESS, RESEARCHERS BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE TOWARD THE TAIL END OF WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN A 15-YEAR COMMITMENT TO LASER WEAPONS BEING APPLIED TO AIRCRAFT. GENERAL ATOMICS REMAINS OPTIMISTIC DESPITE OTHER HURDLES ON THE WAY TO MAKING THIS A REALITY. PERRY SAYS THAT LASER DRONES WILL REQUIRE AN ENTIRELY NEW SOFTWARE LOAD ( LETS HOPE NON-HACKABLE N.W. ), AND THATS NOT ALL: YOULL HAVE A WHOLE NEW CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS. COMPLETELY NEW TRAINING WILL BE REQUIRED, HESAID. THE FIRST VIDEO BELOW SHOWS THE CONCEPT UPON WHICH THE NEW SYSTEM IS BEING BUILT AND APPLIED TO AIRCRAFT. MOST SIGNIFICANT, HOWEVER, IS THE SECOND VIDEO ALSO FROM GENERAL ATOMICS HIGHLIGHTING THE PATH NOT ONLY TO LASER DRONES, BUT FULLY AUTONOMOUS DRONE SYSTEMS EQUIPPED WITH WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED A DEATH RAY. THE SECOND VIDEO WAS RELEASED IN 2012, MAKING ONE THING CLEAR: GENERAL ATOMICS IS FULLY COMMITTED TO REALIZING ITS VISION OF THE FUTURE.

528	YES, YOU CAN TAKE A WEEKEND TRIP TO PARIS! HERE'S HOW I DID. (WHITNEY TRESSEL) I GRABBED MY FIANCS HAND OUTSIDE THE IVY-DRAPED, TRELLISED GARDEN WALLS OF BRASSERIE LA CLOSERIE DES LILAS, AT THE TIP OF A RAZOR-SHARP CORNER IN MONTPARNASSE, AND HALF-LED/HALF-TUGGED HIM INSIDE, THROUGH A GAUNTLET OF FRIENDLY BONJOUR!S FROM WAITERS, ALONGSIDE TABLES OF ALFRESCO DINERS, OVER THE RESTAURANTS TILED MOSAIC FLOORS, PAST THE GRAND PIANO, AND, FINALLY, TO THE LOW-LIT COCKTAIL BAR TUCKED IN THE BACK. SAVE FOR A FEW FRENCH WOMEN QUIETLY SIPPING WHITE WINE AND BARKEEPS IN VESTS AND TIES HUSTLING TO FILL DRINK ORDERS, THE GLOWING RED SPACE WAS BLISSFULLY EMPTYAS WAS THE SPOT AT THE BAR I DESPERATELY WANTED. IT WAS EARLY, AROUND 4 P.M. THAT WAS DELIBERATE. I STEPPED AS SWIFTLY AS I COULD TO THE CURVED BAR AND PLACED MY HANDS ON EITHER SIDE OF A SMALL BRASS PLAQUE NAILED TO THE VARNISHED WOOD. HERE IT IS! I ANNOUNCED, AS MUCH TO MYSELF AS TO NEIL. HE MOVED IN CLOSER TO READ THE ENGRAVED SCRIPT: E. HEMINGWAY. LA CLOSERIE DES LILAS WAS ONE OF ERNEST HEMINGWAYS FAVORITE CAFS TO WRITE IN. HE CALLED IT HIS HOME CAF AND ARGUES WITH A NOSY ACQUAINTANCE THERE IN A PARTICULARLY AMUSING STORY IN A MOVEABLE FEAST . NEIL AND I HAD BOTH READ IT PRIOR TO THE TRIP. I HOPPED UP INTO THE RED LEATHER SEAT FACING THE PLAQUE, AND OVERFLOWING BOWLS OF COMPLIMENTARY GREEN OLIVES AND POTATO CRISPS SOON APPEARED IN FRONT OF US. I ORDERED A HEMINGWAY DAIQUIRI, MADE FROM PINEAPPLE JUICE, CITRON VERT, AND HAVANA RUM; NEIL ASKED FOR AN AMERICANO (CAMPARI, SWEET VERMOUTH, AND SELTZER). BEFORE THE DRINKS ARRIVED, NEIL SNAPPED A PICTURE OF ME AT HEMINGWAYS PERCH. YOU LOOK SO HAPPY, HE SAID. BEING IN PARIS, AT YOUR FAVORITE PLACE, WITH YOUR FAVORITE PERSON, FOLLOWING IN THE LITERAL FOOTSTEPS OF A WRITER YOU ADMIRE, WILL DO THAT. I HAD ONLY 48 HOURS TO SPEND IN THE CITY OF LIGHT, BUT A SINGLE SPECIAL MOMENT IN PARIS IS ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY AN ENTIRE TRIP. FOR ME, IT WAS THAT ONE. LAST MONTH, MY FIANC WAS CALLED AWAY ON A LAST-MINUTE BUSINESS TRIP TO PARIS. DO YOU WANT TO MEET ME THERE FOR THE WEEKEND? HE ASKED. BEFORE HE UTTERED THE D IN WEEKEND, I WAS RESEARCHING FLIGHTS ONLINE. PROBLEM WAS, I HAD ONLY ONE SUMMER FRIDAY TO BURN, MEANING ID ARRIVE AT OUR HOTEL AROUND 4 P.M. ON FRIDAY AND LEAVE FOR THE AIRPORT AT THE SAME TIME ON SUNDAY. TWO DAYS. THATS IT. I STILL SAID YES. YOU ALWAYS SAY YES TO PARIS. TRUE, PARIS HAS PLENTY OF ELEGANT WAYS TO TAKE YOUR BUDGET, STRAP DYNAMITE TO IT, TOSS IT INTO THE AIR, AND SHOOT IT LIKE ITS SKEET, BUT THAT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THE CASE. HERES HOW WE MADE OUR TRIP WORK ON A CONSERVATIVE, HEY-WERE-STILL-SAVING-MONEY-FOR-A-WEDDING BUDGET. YOU CAN TOO, THE NEXT TIME YOU SAY YES TO PARIS. PRIORITIZE LOCATION. SCHLEPPING FROM OUTER NEIGHBORHOODS TO SAVE CASH WASTES VALUABLE MINUTES, AND I WANTED NEIL TO EXPERIENCE ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARISIAN NEIGHBORHOODS, CENTRALLY LOCATED SAINT-GERMAIN-DES-PRS. THE AREA CAN BE PRICEY, BUT WE FOUND A DEAL ON TABLETHOTELS.COM FOR BOUTIQUE HTEL LE SNAT , LESS THAN A BLOCK FROM THE LOVELY, HISTORIC JARDIN DU LUXEMBOURG (FROM ABOUT $171 PER NIGHT; SEE BELOW FOR MORE HOTEL RECOMMENDATIONS). THE MOMENT I WALKED IN, I KNEW WE LUCKED OUT: OUR QUIRKY DUPLEX ROOMTHE WC DOWNSTAIRS, A SHOWER WITH A STEEPLY SLANTED SKYLIGHT UPSTAIRSHAD AIR CONDITIONING (NOT A GUARANTEE IN PARISIAN HOTELS), FIRST-FLOOR WINDOWS THAT SWUNG OPEN TO REVEAL A SPRAWLING ARRAY OF WARM YELLOW ATELIER WINDOWS, AND A PRIVATE UPSTAIRS BALCONY WHERE WE SIPPED CAF AU LAITS IN THE MORNING AND DRANK AFFORDABLE BORDEAUX LATE AT NIGHT, A VIEW OF SACR-COEUR BASILICA ON THE HORIZON, THE NEEDLE OF THE EIFFEL TOWER POKING UP IN THE WEST. TEAR UP YOUR ITINERARY. FOLLOWING YOUR HEART, NOT YOUR HEAD, IS ESSENTIAL TO IMMERSING YOURSELF IN PARIS. THE MINUTE YOU START ADHERING TO A STRICT SCHEDULE, YOURE DOING IT WRONG. WHEN I FIRST VISITED PARIS, ON A SOLO TRIP IN 2011, I CREATED AN AIRTIGHT ITINERARY OF PASTRY-MAKING CLASSES, DAY TRIPS, MUSEUM VISITS, AND RESTAURANT RESERVATIONS. IRONICALLY, THE ACTIVITIES I ENJOYED MOSTLIKE SEEING MARIE ANTOINETTES CELL AT THE CONCIERGERIE (ABOUT $9) AND SCORING A CASHMERE SWEATER ON SUPER-SALE AT ERIC BOMPARD WERENT ON MY DOCKET. THIS TRIP, I SWORE I WOULDNT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE; INSTEAD, THE FIRST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS TAKE MY SWEET TIME IN A CAF, NOT WRITING POSTCARDS OR SCROLLING THROUGH EMAILS ON MY PHONE, BUT SITTING BACK WITH NEIL, EATING HAM SANDWICHES ON PERFECTLY BAKED BAGUETTES, ORDERING MORE CHEESE THAN NECESSARY, AND PRACTICING OUR FRENCH. LE ROSTAND , A CLASSIC CAF AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR HOTEL, QUICKLY BECAME OUR HOME BASE (33/1-43-54-61-58). NOTE: THIS STORY WAS ACCURATE WHEN IT WAS PUBLISHED.

BUT MY NAME IS LAUREN AND I'M A NEW GRADUATE NAVIGATING THROUGH THE REAL WORLD TRYING TO DIG DEEP INTO WHAT MAKES ME TICK.THE REAL WORLD FOR ME BEING, MOVING TO A NEW CITY, STARTING A NEW JOB, AND MOLDING NEW FRIENDSHIPS ALONG THE WAY. MY BLOG IS MY HAPPY PLACE. IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT LIKE MY FAVORITE ANTHROPOLOGIE HACK COASTERS, WRITE RECIPES LIKE MY DELICIOUS MEATLOAF, AND DETAIL MY TRAVELS: RUSSIA, SAN DIEGO (PART 1), SAN DIEGO (PART 2), AND MY NEW ADVENTURE OF EAT, PRAY, LOVING IT IN EUROPE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGERS, ERIKA, DOES THIS SERIES OWNING IT WHERE YOU TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR QUIRKS AND WHAT MAKES YOU, WELL, YOU. EVERY TIME I READ A NEW POST ON A NEW BLOGGER I RACK MY BRAIN OF WHAT I DO THAT IS UNIQUE TO ME. ALAS, THIS MAKES THE PERFECT GUEST POST. I BASICALLY GET ALL MY JUNK ON THE TABLE FROM THE GET-GO! THIS COULD GO ONE OF TWO WAYS...SOME PEOPLE WILL RELATE OR JUST LAUGH AT MY CRAZINESS OR SOME PEOPLE MIGHT RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BUT HEY, I'MOWNINGIT. TODAY AND EVERYDAY. HI I'M LAUREN. 22 YEARS OLD AND I STILL SLEEP WITH MY BABY "BLANKET." YES, I PUT BLANKET IN QUOTATIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY, IT ISN'T A BLANKET ANYMORE. HE IS THEREMNANTOF A FORMER BLANKET TIED TOGETHER IN A RAG. ALSO, YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT I REFER TO MY BLANKET AS "HE" BECAUSE HE JUST ALWAYS HAS BEEN. WEIRD, I KNOW. I CALL HIM "T" BECAUSE MY BABYSITTER CALLED HIM MY TRANQUILIZER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND IT STUCK. HE'S A SENSE OF COMFORT AND MAY I SAY, AWELL-TRAVELEDBLANKET. GOOD GRACIOUS, I'VE LOST HALF OF JULIE'S READERS BY THIS POINT. I'M THE CLUMSIEST PERSON YOU'LL MEET BUT I'VE NEVER BROKEN A BONE AND I'VE NEVER HAD STITCHES.

534	AT THE UNVEILING OF HIS TAX PLAN MONDAY, DONALD TRUMP DEPLOYED A THOROUGHLY DEBUNKED STATISTIC ABOUT THE AMERICAN JOBS MARKET. THE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, HE CLAIMED, IS SOMEWHERE NEAR 42 PERCENT. WHAT ABOUT THE THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SAID WAS 5.1 PERCENT FOR LAST MONTH ? THAT NUMBER, TRUMP SAID, IS THE BIGGEST JOKE THERE IS IN THIS COUNTRY. IN AUGUST, TRUMP MADE THE SAME STATEMENT TO TIME MAGAZINE . I SAW A CHART THE OTHER DAY, OUR REAL UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NINETY MILLION PEOPLE THAT ARENT WORKING. NINETY-THREE MILLION TO BE EXACT," HE SAID. WHATEVER CHART THAT WAS, TRUMP WAS READING ITWRONG. AND HES BEEN CALLED ON HIS ERROR REPEATEDLY . MY COLLEAGUE GLENN KESSLER WROTE A THOROUGH TAKEDOWN AT THE TIME, POINTING OUT THAT TRUMP WAS LUMPING TOGETHER RETIREES, STUDENTS, STAY-AT-HOME MOMS, AND ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARENT FIGURED INTO THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BECAUSE THEY ARENT AVAILABLE TO WORK. IT DOESNT SEEM THAT TRUMP WAS PAYING ATTENTION, SO WERE GOING TO TRY AGAIN WITH CHARTS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE LAST YEAR WAS, ON AVERAGE, 6.2 PERCENT, WHICH REFLECTS ABOUT 9.6 MILLION UNEMPLOYED OUT OF 156 MILLION IN THE CIVILIAN LABOR FORCE (PEOPLE READY AND ABLETO WORK, OR ACTIVELY LOOKING). TO BE OFFICIALLY UNEMPLOYED IN AMERICA, YOU HAVE TO HAVE LOOKED FOR WORK WITHIN THE PAST MONTH. NOW, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE STOPPED LOOKING FOR WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO DISCOURAGED BY THE CRAPPY ECONOMY. BUT MOST PEOPLE WHO AREN'T SEEKING EMPLOYMENT ARE BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS: LEARNING TO WALK, GOING TO SCHOOL, STAYING AT HOME TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN, TAKING A BREATHER FROM WORK, RETIRING TO THE GOOD LIFE. THIS CHART BREAKS IT DOWN: TRUMP MAY HAVE SEEN THAT 92 MILLIONFIGURE ON A CHART SOMEWHERE. AND ITS TRUE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARENT LOOKING FOR WORK. BUT THATS NOT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND WORK THEY WANT. AS NOTED ABOVE, MOST OF THEM HAVE A PRETTY GOOD REASON NOT TO WORK. OF THOSE 92 MILLION PEOPLE OVER 16 WHO WEREN'T LOOKING FOR WORK IN 2014, 86 MILLION (93 PERCENT) DID NOT WANT A JOB RIGHT THEN, ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT SURVEYS. HERE ARE A FEW MORE DETAILS ON HOW THAT GROUP OF AMERICANS BREAKS DOWN: WITHOUT IDENTIFYING ANY ONE IN PARTICULAR, TRUMP SAID MONDAY THAT SOME GREAT ECONOMISTS HAVE PUT THE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 30 PERCENT, 32 PERCENT. HE THEN SAID THE NUMBER MIGHT EVEN BE 42 PERCENT, SAYING THAT'S "THE HIGHEST I'VE HEARD." THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO A 42 PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD BE TO COUNT EVERYONE'S GRANDMAS AND STAY-AT-HOME SPOUSES AS UNEMPLOYED. TO TAKE THIS KIND OF THINKING TO ITS LOGICAL EXTREME, CONSIDER THAT ONLY 146 MILLION OF AMERICA'S 319 MILLION WERE EMPLOYED IN 2014. MORE THAN HALF OF AMERICANS DID NOT HAVE JOBS (IN PART BECAUSE THEY WERE TEETHING). MAYBE THE REAL REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SHOULD BE54 PERCENT? OF COURSE NOT. BUT TRUMP IS CORRECT IN HIS SUSPICION THAT THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBER DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY. OF THE 92 MILLION AMERICANS WHO DIDN'T HAVE JOBS IN 2014, 6 MILLION WANTED A JOB BUT HADN'T BEEN LOOKING RECENTLY. THEY WEREN'T COUNTED IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, SINCE, WELL, THEY WEREN'T LOOKING. THE REASONS VARIED: SOME WENT BACK TOSCHOOL OR BECAME OCCUPIED WITH FAMILY MATTERS. SOME SIMPLY GAVE UP ON FINDING A JOB. THAT LAST CATEGORY DISCOURAGED WORKERS MAY BE WHAT TRUMP WAS REFERRING IN HIS SPEECH MONDAY. HE SAID, WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AND LOOK AND LOOK AND THEN THEY GIVE UP LOOKING FOR A JOB, THEY'RE TAKEN OFF THE ROLLS. THE SCALE OF THE DISCOURAGED-WORKER PROBLEM, THOUGH, IS MUCH SMALLER THAN TRUMP APPEARS TO BELIEVE. IN AUGUST, THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES THAT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 624,000 DISCOURAGED WORKERS FAR FROM 92 MILLION. THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS REPORTS AN ALTERNATIVE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT INCLUDES DISCOURAGED WORKERS. THAT NUMBER WAS 5.5 PERCENT IN AUGUST, COMPARED WITH THE OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHICH WAS 5.1. THERES ANOTHER , BROADER MEASURE OF UNEMPLOYMENT THAT THROWS IN THE MARGINALLY ATTACHED ANYONE WHO LOOKED FOR A JOB IN THE PAST YEAR, BUT NOT WITHIN THE PAST FOUR WEEKS. THERE WERE ABOUT 1.8 MILLION OF THOSE IN AUGUST. ADDING THEM TO THE MIX BUMPS UP THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO 6.2 PERCENT. FINALLY, THE MOST EXPANSIVE WAY THE GOVERNMENT MEASURES UNEMPLOYMENT ALSO FIGURES IN PART-TIME WORKERS WHO CANT FIND FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT. THERE WERE 6.3 MILLION OF THOSE IN AUGUST, AND THEY BRING THE RATE UP TO 10.3 PERCENT. ALL OF THESE NUMBERS PRESENT A USEFUL WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THOSE WHO WANT TO WORK IN AMERICA. THE NUMBER 42 PERCENT? THATS NOT THE ANSWER TO ANYTHING. JEFF GUO IS A STAFF WRITER FOR STORYLINE. HE'S FROM MARYLAND (BUT OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY). FOLLOW HIM ON TWITTER: @_JEFFGUO .
535	MORE PUBLIC SERVICE NEWS FINANCE DEPARTMENT SECRETARY JANE HALTON SAYS IT IS TIME TO SLASH THE AMOUNT OF DUPLICATED INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES MUST GATHER FOR PERFORMANCE REPORTING. MS HALTON SAID RED TAPE NEEDED TO BE CURTAILED BY PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO OFTEN CREATED IT THEMSELVES, SEEMINGLY OUT OF THIN AIR. SHE SAID ONE PUBLIC SERVANT SHE KNEW THOUGHT HE NEEDED THREE QUOTES BEFORE SPENDING $100 ON A CREDIT CARD WHEN IN FACT HE DID NOT. "SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE HAS DECIDED THAT'S WHAT THE RULES ARE AND THAT HAS BECOME LOCAL MYTH," MS HALTON SAID. "IT'S NOT DONE FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN GOOD INTENTIONS." SPEAKING TO AN AUDIENCE OF PUBLIC SERVANTS AT A DINNER TO MARK THE START OF THE FIRST INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ACT CONFERENCE, SHE SAID INFORMATION PROVIDED IN ANNUAL REPORTS - NOW MUCH THICKER THAN THEY WERE 30 YEARS AGO - "DID NOT ADD TO THE SUM OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE". MS HALTON ALSO REVEALED AS HEALTH DEPARTMENT SECRETARY SHE "HAD WORDS" WITH JOE HOCKEY, WHEN HE WAS SHADOW TREASURER, ABOUT FACTUALLY INCORRECT CLAIMS HE MADE REGARDING ALLEGED FEDERAL-STATE DUPLICATION. IN 2012 HE WAS OFTEN QUOTED AS SAYING "THERE'S A DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN CANBERRA WITH OVER 6000 EMPLOYEES - NOT ONE OF THEM IS A DOCTOR OR NOT ONE OF THEM IS A NURSE TREATING A PATIENT". IN FACT THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC SERVANTS WAS NOT AS HIGH AS 6000 AND A NUMBER OF THEM WERE DOCTORS. "I THINK IT WAS A RHETORICAL FLOURISH," MS HALTON SAID. SHE BALANCED THIS BY SAYING IT WAS FAIR TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE BECAUSE EXPERIENCE HAD SHOWN IT WAS EASY FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE WORKFORCE TO ESCALATE. TREASURY SECRETARY JOHN FRASER, BROUGHT FROM GLOBAL ASSET MANAGER UBS EIGHT MONTHS AGO, SAID THE "RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY" IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE "STILL GETS YOU DOWN AT TIMES" BUT HE FELT AS THOUGH PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE. HE CREDITED PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONER JOHN LLOYD WITH MAKING IT EASIER TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RECRUIT STAFF. AT A TIME WHEN THE PUBLIC SERVICE WILL BE LOOKING TO MAKE THE MOST OF TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW IT TO WORK QUICKER, MR FRASER SAID HE WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE AUSTRALIAN BUREAUCRACY TO FIND SOME OF THE OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY USED.

538	THE GARDINER EAST FOLLIES RETURNS FOR YET ANOTHER EXTENDED RUN AT CITY HALL BEGINNING ON TUESDAY MORNING, WHEN CITY OFFICIALS PRESENT THREE SCENARIOS FOR RELOCATING THE HIGHWAYS EASTERN END TO FREE UP VALUABLE WATERFRONT LAND. FOR MUCH OF THIS YEAR, AND SOME OF 2014, THE LIONS SHARE OF PUBLIC, POLICY AND POLITICAL ATTENTION HAS FOCUSED INTENSIVELY ON THE STRETCH BETWEEN CHERRY STREET AND THE DON RIVER . (FOR MORE ON THE ORIGINS OF THE PROBLEMATIC LOOP, READ THIS .) FIRST GULF, WHICH WANTS TO TRANSFORM THE SPRAWLING LEVER BROTHERS SITE INTO TORONTOS CANARY WHARF, HAS A STRONG INTEREST IN THE ALIGNMENT OF THE GARDINER/DVP INTERCHANGE, AS DO THE DEVELOPERS WHO OWN LAND ALONG THE KEATING CHANNEL. IN A SHOW LAST SPRING, SUBURBAN COUNCILLORS PUSHED TO KEEP THE HIGHWAY NETWORK IN TACT, WHILE DOWNTOWNERS FOUGHT TO REPLACE THAT ONE PORTION WITH AN AT-GRADE BOULEVARD. AFTER COUNCIL BACKED THE HYBRID OPTION, STAFF SPENT THE SUMMER CONSULTING WITH WATERFRONT ACTIVISTS, DEVELOPERS AND ENGINEERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PULL THE GARDINER NORTH TOWARDS THE RAILWAY YARD WHILE RE-CONCEPTUALIZING THE INTERCHANGE AS A SET OF RAMPS BETWEEN TWO HIGHWAYS INSTEAD OF A SINGLE CONTINUOUS ROUTE. THE ARM-WAVING ABOUT THE INTERCHANGE, HOWEVER, HAS MEANT THAT ALMOST NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT NASTY SEGMENT OF THE GARDINER THAT RUNS ASTRIDE LAKESHORE BLVD EAST, BETWEEN JARVIS AND CHERRY. INDEED, THE LATEST CITY STAFF REPORT NOTES THAT THE SECTION WEST OF CHERRY WILL LARGELY BE MAINTAINED. AND THEREIN LIES A MASSIVE MISSED OPPORTUNITY, ACCORDING TO ARCHITECT AND PLANNER CALVIN BROOK. HIS FIRM, BROOK MCILROY , HAS PITCHED CITY STAFF ON AN AMBITIOUS SCHEME TO STACK THAT STRETCH OF THE GARDINER ABOVE AN EXPANDED RAIL CORRIDOR AS A MEANS OF CREATING A KILOMETRE-LONG ELEVATED LINEAR PARK, 3.3 HECTARES OF NEW DEVELOPABLE CITY LAND AND A FRESH LEASE ON LIFE FOR LAKESHORE BLVD EAST. THE PLAN [ DOWNLOAD IT FROM DROPBOX ] WILL BE PRESENTED BRIEFLY DURING TOMORROWS COMMITTEE MEETING; CITY OFFICIALS ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED THAT THEYVE COMMISSIONED A COST-BENEFIT EVALUATION. BROOK MCILROYS CONSULTANTS, MEANWHILE, ESTIMATE THAT THE CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR THAT NEW GARDINER SEGMENT WILL BE $316 MILLION AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE OFFSET BY LAND SALES ON 4.3 MILLION SQ.-FT OF FREED-UP SPACE. BROOK, WHO HAS BEEN PONDERING HOW TO UNSTACK THE GARDINER AND THE LAKESHORE FOR MANY YEARS, EXPLAINED HIS PROPOSAL TO SPACING LAST WEEK. METROLINX, HE SAYS, PLANS TO EXPAND ITS GO SERVICE FROM 400 TRAINS PER DAY TO OVER 1,000 AS THE AGENCY MOVES TO AN ELECTRIFIED REGIONAL RAIL OFFERING OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS. THAT MEANS ADDING TRACKS THROUGH THE UNION STATION CORRIDOR, AND THEREFORE WIDENING THE RAILWAY BERM THAT HAS LONG BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE WATERFRONTS POOR ACCESSIBILITY. THE CITY OWNS A LONG FINGER OF LAND SOUTH OF THE TRACKS BETWEEN JARVIS AND CHERRY, AS WELL AS THE LAND BENEATH THE GARDINER AND THE LAKESHORE; THE THREE SLICES ARE ALMOST 70 METRES ACROSS IN SOME PLACES. IF THE CITY AND METROLINX CAN ALIGN THEIR CONSTRUCTION AGENDAS, BROOK SAYS, THEY COULD EXPAND THE EXISTING BERM SOUTH TO CREATE NOT ONLY ADDITIONAL TRACK SPACE, BUT A DECK ABOVE THE NEW TRACKS, UPON WHICH THE FOUR-LANE GARDINER COULD RUN. THE HIGHWAY PORTION, IN TURN, COULD ALSO BE DECKED, CREATING A LINEAR PARK OVERHEAD. THE PREMISE OF THIS IS VERY SIMPLE, HE STATES. ITS TO TAKE TWO INTERRUPTIONS IN THE FABRIC OF THE CITY AND TURN THEM INTO ONE. BROOKS POINTS TO SEVERAL COMPELLING ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF RE-BUILDING THE EASTERN GARDINER IN THIS WAY: STAGING : THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BERM, THE RAIL LINES, THE DECKING, THE HIGHWAY AND THE GREEN ROOF COULD ALL BE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT MAKING ANY ALTERATIONS TO THE EXISTING GARDINER. THAT TRANSLATES INTO NO CONSTRUCTION DELAYS AND ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO STAGING, WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DRIVE UP CAPITAL OUTLAYS. WHEN THE NEW GARDINER IS FINISHED, TRAFFIC CAN BE RE-ROUTED ONTO IT, AND THE DEMOLITION OF THE OLD ONE CAN COMMENCE. UNLOCKING CITY-OWNED LAND . BY STACKING THE GARDINER ON TOP OF THOSE NEW RAIL LINES, THE CITY FREES UP A STRETCH OF LAND THATS ABOUT 40 METRES DEEP AND ALMOST A KILOMETRE LONG MORE THAN ENOUGH SPACE, BROOK SAYS, TO DEVELOP POINT TOWERS, MID-RISE BUILDINGS AND OTHER STRUCTURES ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF LAKESHORE BLVD. EAST PUBLIC SPACE IMPROVEMENTS . WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT NOW POSSIBLE ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF LAKESHORE, THAT STREET GAINS A SECOND LEASE ON LIFE, AND CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO AN URBAN AVENUE RATHER THAN A SURFACE HIGHWAY. LIKEWISE, THE LINEAR PARK BUILT ABOVE THE DECKED GARDINER WILL SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF THOSE BUILDINGS DEVELOPED NORTH OF LAKESHORE, AS WELL AS OTHER WATERFRONT VISITORS AND INHABITANTS. IT ALSO PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE MID-BLOCK CONNECTIONS AND EVEN WIDER LAND BRIDGES ACROSS THE TRACKS THAT WOULD LINK THE EAST BAYFRONT COMMUNITY TO ST. LAWRENCE. BROOK POINTS OUT THAT THE LINEAR PARK WILL BE ROUGHLY AT THE SAME VERTICAL ELEVATION AS THE DECK OF THE CURRENT GARDINER, SO THIS EXTENDED STRUCTURE WONT SERVE AS YET ANOTHER VISUAL BARRIER. WHATS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT ITS VERY POROUS IN A NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION, HE SAYS, WITH EASY PEDESTRIAN/CYCLIST ACCESS BETWEEN LAKESHORE, THE LINEAR PARK AND GATEWAY POINTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CORRIDOR. HE ALSO OBSERVES THAT BROOKFIELD, THE CANADIAN COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT GIANT, HAS DEPLOYED NEW DECKING TECHNOLOGY AT ITS SPRAWLING HUDSON YARDS PROJECT IN MID-TOWN MANHATTAN, ALLOWING AN ACTIVE COMMUTER RAIL YARD TO CONTINUE FUNCTIONING WHILE A MASSIVE INTENSIFICATION PROJECT IS CONSTRUCTED DIRECTLY ABOVE IT. THE IDEA REQUIRES BOTH POLITICAL WILL, BUT ALSO A LEAP OF FAITH NOT BECAUSE IT IS TECHNICALLY COMPLEX OR FINANCIALLY OUTRAGEOUS, BUT RATHER DUE TO THE FACT THAT TORONTO, WITH ITS INCREMENTALIST POLITICAL CULTURE, HAS LONG TENDED TO SHUN BIG MOVES. YET THE RAILWAY BERM, CONSTRUCTED BACK IN THE 1920S TO MODERNIZE ACCESS TO AN INDUSTRIALIZING WATERFRONT, WAS A BIG MOVE, AS WAS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE GARDINER IN THE MID-1950S. BIG MOVES, ONE COULD ARGUE, MUST BE MET WITH OTHER BIG MOVES. AND THATS WHAT BROOK WILL BE PROPOSING TOMORROW. WITH THE GARDINER EAST EA DUE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE PROVINCE BY NEXT SPRING, MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL POLITICIANS SHOULD LISTEN TO BROOK BECAUSE HIS IDEA IS NOT ONLY PLAUSIBLE; IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE TRANSFORMATIONAL IN A HIGHLY CHALLENGED GEOGRAPHY THAT REQUIRES US, FINALLY, TO MAKE NO (MORE) LITTLE PLANS .

539	HARDWORKING BLACK AMERICANS ARE BEING CRUSHED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF AN ILLEGAL ALIEN WORKFORCE, EVER EXPANDING AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE POLICIES OF AMERICAS FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. NOW, A RECENT SURVEYUSA POLL THAT SHOWED25 PERCENT OF BLACK RESPONDENTS WHO SAID THEY WOULD VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP OVER HILLARY CLINTON IS EVIDENCE FOR SOME THAT BLACK AMERICANS ARE APTTO SUPPORT A REPUBLICAN FOR PRESIDENT. FAR TOO MANY SUPPOSED REPUBLICAN LEADERS AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE TO THE LEFT OF OBAMA WHEN IT COMES TO AMNESTY FOR THOSE IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, WROTE RAYNARD JACKSON , THE FOUNDER OF A D.C.-BASED POLITICAL CONSULTING FIRM. HOW CAN YOU AGGRESSIVELY SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF POLICY WHEN IT WILL CONTINUE TO DEPRESS WAGES OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE CLASSES? JACKSON ASKS OF A NATIONAL REPUBLICAN PARTY ESTABLISHMENT THAT HAS PROTECTED MONIED EMPLOYERS WHO HIRE ILLEGAL ALIENS AT THE EXPENSE OF LOW-SKILLED, WORKING CLASS BLACK AMERICANS. THIS CHEAP LABOR WILL ALSO EXACERBATE THE BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT RATE , WHICH IS THE HIGHEST OF ANY GROUP IN THE COUNTRY, JACKSON ADDS. OH, I FORGOT, BLACKS DONT COUNT; SO REPUBLICANS REMAIN SILENT ON THIS ISSUE. BUT NOT ALL REPUBLICANS ARE SILENT ON THIS ISSUE. DONALD TRUMP CAN CREDIT MUCH OF HIS METEORIC RISE TO THE TOP OF THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL FIELD TO HIS WILLINGNESS TO AIR OUT THE DIRTY LAUNDRY OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, SIMULTANEOUSLY EMBARRASSING BOTH THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS COMMUNITY. MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE REPUBLICAN FIELD, TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACT OF ILLEGAL, CHEAP LABOR ON THE BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, JACKSON WRITES. ON THIS ISSUE, HE IS MORE IN TUNE WITH THE GRASSROOTS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAN OBAMA, THE NAACP, THE NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE, AND THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUSGO FIGURE. INDEED, PEOPLE LIKE PETER KIRSANOW, AN OFFICIAL WITH THE U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION, HAVE MADE THE CASE THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION HAS SEVERELY DEPRESSED THE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE OF LOW-SKILLED BLACKS ONLY TO BE ROUNDLY IGNORED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS. GRANTING WORK AUTHORIZATION TO MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WILL DEVASTATE THE BLACK COMMUNITY, WHICH IS ALREADY STRUGGLING IN THE WAKE OF THE RECESSION THAT BEGAN IN 2007 AND THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS OF MALAISE,KIRSANOW WROTE LAST YEARTO OBAMA AND THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION HAS A DISPARATE IMPACT ON AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN, BECAUSE THESE MEN ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED IN THE LOW-SKILLED LABOR FORCE. MEANWHILE, THE CIVIL RIGHTS ESTABLISHMENT IS IMPOTENT. AND THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT ISCOMPLICIT. ITS NOW CLICHE TO SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP DEFIES THE LAWS OF POLITICAL GRAVITY. I THINK HES JUST GETTING STARTED. IF TRUMP REALLY WANTS TO TURN AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS ON ITS HEAD AND DISMANTLE THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT IN THE PROCESS, THEN HE SHOULD MAKE THIS A FICTIONALHEADLINE A REALITY: DONALD TRUMP VOWS TO MAKE B LACK AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

541	SOMEHOW, LISA GOT THIS! ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIES OF THE COSMOS! I JUST WANT TO KEEP IT........... HHHMMMMMM.............SORRY IT'S BEEN SO LONG......... I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU ALL DURING THE WEEK, BUT..........WELL, MAYBE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND BETTER WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF THIS........... I SHOWED YOU PICTURES OF MY EMPTY ROOM..........THAT WAS MONDAY. TUESDAY MORNING, FIRST THING, THE MEN CAME TO LAY THE NEW CARPET. HAD IT ALL DONE ABOUT NOON AND WE NEEDED TO STAY OFF OF IT FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS. THEN IT WAS TIME TO COME HOME. AND I WASN'T ALL THAT ANXIOUS TO DO THE WORK TO GET IT ALL BACK TOGETHER........BESIDES, I COULDN'T MOVE THE SHELVES......... WHEN I ARRIVED WEDNESDAY MORNING--AND I WAS LATE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING DISTRICT MEETING AND WE WERE TAKING LUNCH FOR ALL THE ELDERS--12 OF THEM. I MADE CHICKEN ENCHILADAS. SOOOO........WHEN I GOT TO THE OFFICE, THE SHELVES WERE ALL IN AND SEVERAL OF THE BOXES--LOTS OF THEM, IN FACT--AND SOME STACKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR. SIS. NEWMAN SAID THEY GOT THAT FAR AND THEN SHE DIDN'T REMEMBER HOW THINGS WERE AND DIDN'T WANT ME TO FEEL THAT MY TOES HAD BEEN STEPPED ON........ WHEN I STOOD THERE, ALONE, AND LOOKED AROUND, THE PANIC BEGAN TO RISE. THIS IS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS FOR ME TO DO! FIND A "HOME" FOR EVERYTHING!! AND HAVE IT MAKE SENSE! HELP!!!!!!!! I WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER WHERE SHELVES HAD BEEN (HOW FAR APART, ETC) AND PUTTING SOME OF THE PASS-ALONG CARDS AWAY WHEN SIS. NEWMAN CAME BACK IN AND OFFERED TO HELP. BLESS HER!!! I WOULD HAVE BEEN FIGHTING WITH MYSELF ALL DAY LONG OTHERWISE. IT WAS SO GOOD TO HAVE A COHORT!!! THE ASSISTANTS WERE ON EXCHANGES--WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND ONE OF THEM IS IN THE OFFICE, THE ELDER WITH HIM REALLY DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TO DO. SO WE PUT HIM TO WORK. AND WORK HE DID!!!! HE LIFTED ALL THE HEAVY STUFF--BOXES OF BOOKS, OBVIOUSLY, AND PAMPHLETS .......AND GOT THEM ALL ON SHELVES. THEN I HAD HIM BRING ALL THE REST OF THE MATERIALS OUT OF THE OTHER ROOM (THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE). HE BARELY FINISHED THAT WHEN ELDER SARIAH CAME TO GET HIM FOR AN APPOINTMENT. I WAS SO THANKFUL TO HAVE ALL THAT DONE!! SIS. NEWMAN STUCK WITH ME UNTIL NEARLY EVERYTHING WAS "PUT BACK". THERE WERE 4-5 ODDS AND ENDS BOXES LEFT IN THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE THAT I CLEANED OUT AND TOOK CARE OF. BUT WITH ALL THE HELP I HAD NO PANIC AND THE ROOM IS ALL PUT BACK TOGETHER. RAH!!!!! AND JUST IN TIME..........IT'S JUST TWO WEEKS TO MLC AGAIN. AND NEXT WEEK WE HAVE TRANSFERS............THIS IS GOING TO BE A "SADDER" ONE FOR US, AS WE KNOW MORE OF THE ELDERS GOING HOME THIS TIME--INCLUDING ONE FROM ENSLEY. THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WERE REALLY QUIET DAYS............IN FACT, I TOOK A POWER NAP (THAT DOESN'T SOUND AS BAD AS JUST "NAP") THURSDAY MORNING! I DID A LITTLE FILING FOR ROGER AFTER I PLACED MY ORDER FOR MATERIALS......MOSTLY COPIES OF THE BOOK OF MORMON--I THINK I ORDERED 800. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT, BUT THAT'S ONLY EIGHT FOR EACH COMPANIONSHIP. ROGER AND I TOOK CARS HERE OR THERE FOR REPAIRS ETC.----WELL, ONLY TWO; THANKFULLY I HAD MY EMBROIDERY AND ENJOYED WORKING ON THAT SOME. PRES. AND SIS. HANKS CAME FRIDAY FOR A LITTLE BIT AND I HAD A FUN VISIT WITH HER. SHE LIKED MY EMBROIDERY AND WANTED TO SEE THE FINISHED QUILT, SO WE SPENT A BIT OF TIME LOOKING ONLINE FOR IT, BUT I HAD THE WRONG DESIGNER, SO SHE DIDN'T GET TO SEE IT. AND WE FOUND OUT D IS IN THE HOSPITAL. SHE WAS SCHEDULED FOR BAPTISM DAY AFTER TOMORROW, BUT THAT IS NOW POSTPONED. WE WENT TO VISIT HER TODAY. SHE TRIES TO BE SO BRAVE AND UPBEAT ALL THE TIME, BUT WHEN I HUGGED HER SHE STARTED TO CRY AND JUST KEPT HUGGING ME AND CRYING............ I AM LEARNING THAT THERE IS MORE HEARTACHE AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE WORLD THAN I EVER KNEW. AND IT HAPPENS TO REAL PEOPLE. MOST OF WHOM WE WOULD LOVE IF WE KNEW THEM. AND THERE'S REALLY NO WAY TO TAKE AWAY THE HEARTACHE.........WE CAN HELP THEM ENDURE IT AND LIVE WITH IT AND BE HAPPY DESPITE IT. BUT IT IS ALWAYS THERE. I'M ALSO LEARNING THAT IT IS THE COMMON LOT OF MAN! WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.............. WE EXPECT D TO BE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL SOON AND THEN WE CAN PLAN THE BAPTISM. THAT WILL BE A HAPPY DAY! I'M GOING TO MAKE A SEPARATE POST ABOUT YESTERDAY.......I HAVE A BUNCH OF PICTURES AND THIS IS LONG ALREADY.

543	KR: RIGHT, THE FETUS CONSTANTLY ADAPTS TO THE WOMB ENVIRONMENT AND PAYS THE PRICE FOR IT. THE FIRST ORDER IS SURVIVE AT ALL COSTS. THEN IF WERE FORTUNATE LATER, POSSIBLY THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO GO BACK AND TAKE CARE OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS, AND ALSO ITS THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO. NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL THEIR PAIN, NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL TERROR OR ANYTHING UNPLEASANT REALLY. THATS WHAT OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE ABOUT, DISTRACTING OURSELVES IN A THOUSAND WAYS FROM ALL THIS PAIN WERE CARRYING AROUND, WHICH KEEPS RELENTLESSLY SURGING TO BE MADE CONSCIOUS. DR. JANOV WRITES, THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA WHILE BEING CARRIED AND IN CHILDHOOD DIE IN AVERAGE TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THOSE RISK FACTORS. SO HERE THIS IS A GOOD ARGUMENT, FOR UNDERSTANDING AND RELIVING AND FEELING OUR PAIN, AND POSSIBLY EVEN HEALING BIG SECTIONS OF OUR HEARTS AND SOULS THAT ARE THERE WAS AN OLD BOOK THAT HE WROTE CALLED PRISONERS OF PAIN. THAT WERE ALL KIND OF HUGGED TIED BY OUR PAIN AND THE REPRESSION THAT WE USE TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT. JL: RIGHT, AND I THINK THIS CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF AFFECTS TOO IN TERMS OF HOW WE REPRESS OR HOW WE TRY TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE JUST AS BAD IF WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DIG PAST THE PAIN OR REPRESS IT THAT CREATES ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM, WHICH CAN THEN SHOW UP IN OTHER WAYS. THERE HASNT BEEN A LOT OF DEFINITIVE RESEARCH ON THIS, BUT DR. JANOV REALLY BELIEVES THAT THIS ALSO MAY BE BEHIND WHAT EVENTUALLY CAUSES CANCER, THIS SORT OF MASSIVE REPRESSION ON THE CELLULAR LEVEL THAT PREVENTS NATURAL GROWTH AND THEN OVERTIME CREATES CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES. KR: ID LIKE TO READ ANOTHER SHORT SECTION HERE, DR. JANOV WRITES, WHAT MOST OF MEDICINE AND PSYCHOTHERAPY INVOLVES TODAY IS THE TREATMENT OF FRAGMENTS OF THE HUMAN BEING. WE THEN GO ABOUT TREATING THE VARIED OFFSHOOTS FROM A CENTRAL IMPRINT, RATHER THAN THE IMPRINT ITSELF. TREATMENT BECOMES INTERMINABLE, WHAT WE GET IS A FRAGMENT OF PROGRESS, A CHANGE IN ASPECTS OF AN EARLY EXPERIENCE, RATHER THAN A HOLISTIC RECALIBRATION OR NEURO AND PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS CONNECTED WITH THE EXPERIENCE. JL: RIGHT. I THINK THATS REALLY TO KIND OF TAKE THAT AND KIND OF GO TIED IN WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYING COMPARISONS HE DRAWS IN THE BOOK TO SOMEBODY LIKE FREUD, THE RELATIONSHIP HE HAS WITH SOME OF THE EARLIER SCHOOLS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT PRECEDED HIM IS COMPLICATED. FREUD HE HAD THIS NOTION THAT HYSTERIA WAS ROOTED IN REPRESSED SEXUAL DESIRE AND HE OFTEN CHARTED IT IN DREAMS AND SORT OF THIS SYMBOLIC NOTION OF DREAMS. I THINK WHAT JANOV REALLY DOES IS HE TAKES, MUCH LIKE THOSE I THINK, THINKERS WHO DWELLED IN BIG IDEAS AND SORT OF PROFOUND CONCLUSIONS, HE SORT OF NOTES THAT WHILE FREUD WAS WORKING ON THE SYMBOLIC LABELS AND MISSED A LOT, HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS. INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOW THIS HYSTERIA WOULD CONSTANTLY BE UNREFLECTIVE AND PRONE TO OVERREACTION, AND JANOV WOULD SAY THAT YES THESE TRAITS EXIST, BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR SYMBOLS IN DREAMS, HELL LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF WHATS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN WERE HAVING NIGHTMARES. WHATS HAPPENING TO US BIOLOGICALLY WHEN WE HAVE A NIGHTMARE, OR WHAT DO WE FEEL DURING THAT TIME, AND WHY IS THAT TERROR COMING UP. HELL LOOK TO THE LIMBIC SYSTEM TO FIND WHERE THE TERROR IS ACTUALLY ROOTED. HES NOT TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THATS GOING TO CALM DOWN A PATIENT WHO HAS ADD OR DEPRESSION FOR THE DAY OR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. EVEN SOMETHING THAT MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO, HES REALLY LOOKING TO SOMETHING THAT CAN EVENTUALLY PROMOTE A CURE.  TED CRUZ AND FORMER FLORIDA GOV. KR: IM GOING TO READ ONE MORE PARAGRAPH OK? ON MY END DR. JANOV WRITES, THE BRAIN WE NEED TO ADDRESS DOESNT TALK, DOESNT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT DOESNT UNDERSTAND WORDS. IN FACT, THE TERM UNDERSTAND IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER, WE ARE NOT AFTER UNDERSTANDING IN THE INTELLECTUAL SENSE OF THE TERM, WE ARE AFTER INTEGRATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT CEREBRAL UNDERSTANDING. YES, UNDERSTANDING HELPS, BUT IT MUST NOT BE CONFUSED WITH RESOLVING, CONNECTING AND INTEGRATING. WHEN A THERAPIST TRIES TO GET A PATIENT TO REPORT ON HIS FEELINGS ALL MAY BE LOST, FOR THOSE FEELINGS MAY BE WORDLESS. TRYING TO EXPRESS THEM VERBALLY DISTANCES US FROM THE ORIGINS OF OUR PAIN IN THE LOWER BRAIN, AND SINCE ONE LAYER OF BRAIN TISSUE CANNOT DO THE WORK OF ANOTHER WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY TRUMPED OR EFFORTS, ONCE WE GET AWAY FROM WORDS WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT IS CURATIVE. UNDERSTANDING CAME LAST IN HUMAN EVOLUTION, LONG AFTER FEELING, AND IT WILL NOT LEAD US TO THE LONG TERM HEALING WE ARE AFTER. NONE OF THIS REQUIRES ABSTRACT OR ESOTERIC METHODS, WE CAN MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN SOCIETY JUST BY PAYING ATTENTION TO GESTATION AND CHANGING OUR BIRTH PRACTICES. JL: RIGHT, AND I MEAN I THINK THATS ONE OF THE BOOKS KEY CONCLUSIONS, IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT BIRTH PRACTICES AND LOOK AT A MOTHERS EMOTIONAL STATE AS NOT JUST NOT AT ALL INCIDENTAL. I THINK THE IDEA THAT FEELING IS CONNECTED TO OUR BIOLOGY AND HAS THESE SORT OF BIOLOGIC IMPLICATIONS, WE CAN SEE IT IN OUR BIOLOGY IS A PRETTY DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE FIELD. A FIELD THAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY TALK THERAPY AND BY APPROACHES REALLY FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS, NOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN. THATS WHERE I THINK DR. JANOV IS REALLY LOOKING TO GO. KR: WELL, IT EXCITES ME BECAUSE I THINK IT OPENS A HUGE DOOR. I THINK IT OPENS AN ENORMOUS DOOR OF UNDERSTANDING AND OF SUGGESTING VERY FUNDAMENTAL, NONE ESOTERIC, AS HE SAYS, SIMPLE BIRTH PRACTICES, PRACTICES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILD BIRTHING THAT CAN HAVE THE MOST DRAMATIC AND FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR HUMAN FUTURE. IT CAN PROBABLY DO MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE BILLABLE HOURS IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROFESSION. JL: YES, I THINK THERE WAS A CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK THAT CAME ABOUT LATER SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH PREGNANCY, AND I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME WORKING WITH DR. JANOV IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND JUST KIND OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE CONSTANT INFLUX OF NEW IDEAS AND RESEARCH HE WAS EXPOSING ME TO AND ALL THE WORK THAT WAS BEING DONE, IN THE FIELD OF EPIGENETICS AND IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL HEALTH AND NEW STUDIES HE WAS SHOWING ME ABOUT MEMORY AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE OTHER TOPICS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK REALLY STUCK WAS THIS IDEA ABOUT WHAT TO DO DURING PREGNANCY. AND HE ENDED UP SORT OF WRITING A CHAPTER ON PREGNANCY AND JUST OFFERING SOME ALMOST CONCRETE PIECES OF ADVICE FOR WOMEN THAT CAN HAVE SOME REALLY LASTING IMPLICATIONS. AS HE WRITES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OXYMORON FOR ME TO GIVE ADVICE SINCE I AM NOT BY PROFESSION NOR INTENTION AN AFICIONADO OF ADVICE. BUT LET US NOT MINIMIZE WHAT A CARRYING MOTHER CAN DO FOR THE GOOD OR BAD OF HER CHILD. IT IS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THAT HE APPROACHES THE SUBJECT, BECAUSE HE IS MALE AND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT IF YOURE SORT OF PROVIDING SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOW IT BEHAVED. BUT THINGS LIKE WATCHING YOUR STRESS; IF I CAN READ JUST A COUPLE PARTS OF THIS CHAPTER I THINK ITS REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE IS NO WAY TO ELIMINATE STRESS ENTIRELY, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS TO MANAGE IT. DONT PLAN A NEW BUSINESS OR START A SERIES OF COMPLICATED PROJECTS THAT PUT YOU UNDER STRESS WHILE PREGNANT. THE BABY WILL FEEL THIS ANXIETY AND SUFFER. TRY TO WORK OUT PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SPOUSE BEFORE YOU GET PREGNANT. ONCE YOU ARE PREGNANT, IT IS LARGELY TOO LATE. THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD NEVER ARGUE OR FIGHT AGAIN; BUT TRY TO RESOLVE THE MORE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES BEFORE YOU INTRODUCE A NEW LIFE ON THIS PLANET.  WE ARE SIGNALING TO OUR FUTURE EMPLOYEES AND OUR CURRENT EMPLOYEES, HERMAN SAID, THAT WE DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THAT BASIS, AND WHAT WE CARE ABOUT IS RESULTS AND HARD WORK, AND BEING A COMPETENT AND CARING EMPLOYEE. THE BABY DESERVES HIS OR HER BEST CHANCE AT LIFE, AND WHAT YOU DO DURING PREGNANCY TO MANAGE YOUR STRESS IS IMPORTANT, IN THAT REGARD. HE TALKS ABOUT EATING RIGHT AND GETTING PROTEIN, CALCIUM, FOLIC ACID, FIBER. HE TALKS ABOUT BEING VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GOING ABOUT TRANQUILIZERS AND PAINKILLERS TO RELIVE ANXIETY. NEW STUDIES ARE COMING OUT ALL THE TIME ON THIS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NEW STUDIES ON THE USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS, THE USE OF TRANQUILIZERS DURING PREGNANCY, AND WERE STILL KIND OF FIGURING OUT WHAT ALL THIS DOES, ULTIMATELY IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE MOTHER TO KEEP HER EMOTIONS BALANCED BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO SEE WHAT OTHER EFFECTS THIS COULD HAVE DURING GESTATION. I THINK THE MAIN THING HE FOCUSES ON ALL OF THIS IS LOVE. TO TOUCH YOUR BABY EARLY ON, TO BREASTFEED IF YOU CAN, HE SAYS, "READ FRENCH OBSTETRICIAN FREDERIC LEBOYER, WHO POPULARIZED THE PRACTICE OF IMMERSING THE NEWBORN IN A WARM WATER BATH, WITHOUT DRUGS AND WITHOUT BRIGHT LIGHTS. LEBOYER RECOMMENDS THAT THE BABY BE HELD RIGHT AWAY AND FOR A LONG TIME. HE ADVISES AGAINST CUTTING THE UMBILICAL CORD TOO SOON AS THE CHILD'S ATTACHMENT WITH HIS MOTHER IS VITAL AT THE START OF LIFE." "THERE IS NO GREATER ADVICE I CAN GIVE THAN THIS: BE OPEN, EXPRESSIVE, AND FEELING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. A CARING MOTHER GIVES HER BABY THE BEST CHANCE FOR LONG-TERM WELL-BEING. YES, EVEN IF YOU DON'T EAT THOSE CARROTS AND TOMATOES WHEN YOU SHOULD, LOVE WILL HELP. YOUR CHILD IS PART OF YOU AND FEELS WHAT YOU FEEL, EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS IT. ALL I ASK IS AWARENESS. THE RESEARCH IS THERE; WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS ANYMORE." HE'S PUTTING IT OUT THERE, WE HAVE RESEARCH INTO THIS FIELD, WE CAN'T TURN A BLIND EYE TO IT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN.
544	POPE TO CELEBRATE SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS FOR 20,000 AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN BY BETH GRIFFIN CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE NEW YORK (CNS) A SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS IS IN THE WORKS WHEN POPE FRANCIS CELEBRATES THE LITURGY WITH 20,000 PEOPLE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN DURING HIS U.S. VISIT. SIMPLE TAKES ON A NEW DIMENSION WHEN THE POPE IS THE CELEBRANT AND THE CONGREGATION CLEARS SECURITY CHECKPOINTS HOURS BEFORE THE OPENING NOTES OF THE ENTRANCE HYMN AT THE SEPT. 25 CELEBRATION. IN SUBSTANCE, EVERY MASS IS THE SAME. THIS ONE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE ELABORATE, NEW YORK CARDINAL TIMOTHY M. DOLAN SAID OF THE ARCHDIOCESES PLANNING EFFORT SEPT. 2. THE LITURGICAL OPTION FOR THE DAY IS THE MASS FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID, EXPLAINING THAT THE CHOICE REFLECTS THE HIGH EMPHASIS POPE FRANCIS PUTS ON THIS, AND BECAUSE THAT DAY HE WILL BE AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND ALSO VISIT TWO SITES IN THE ARCHDIOCESE DEVOTED TO THAT. THE READINGS AND PRAYERS ARE A GIVEN, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID. BUT THE MUSIC, THE GIFTS, THE INTERCESSIONS, THE READERS AND OTHER ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY SELECTED TO REPRESENT THE DIVERSE LANGUAGES, FAMILIES, APOSTOLATES, PARISHES AND MINISTRIES OF THIS VAST REGION, HE SAID. FATHER MATTHEW ERNEST, DIRECTOR OF THE ARCHDIOCESAN OFFICE OF LITURGY, TOLD CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE, THAT SOME OF THE LITURGICAL OPTIONS SELECTED WILL MAKE IT MORE LIKE A SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS, INCLUDING ELIMINATING THE GLORIA AND THE CREED AND USING ONLY ONE READING BEFORE THE GOSPEL. FATHER ERNEST SAID THE FIRST READING WILL BE IN SPANISH, THE GOSPEL WILL BE SUNG IN ENGLISH, AND POPE FRANCIS WILL OFFER THE SECOND EUCHARISTIC PRAYER IN LATIN. HE IS EXPECTED TO PREACH THE HOMILY IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. INTERCESSIONS WILL BE MADE IN ENGLISH, SPANISH, POLISH, GAELIC, GERMAN TIGRINYA AND ITALIAN. THE LITURGIST SAID THE POPE WILL CONCELEBRATE THE MASS WITH CARDINALS, BISHOPS FROM THE NEW YORK PROVINCE AND AN AS-YET-UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF LOCAL PRIESTS. OTHER PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE FAITHFUL PARISHIONERS WHO REPRESENT COMMUNITIES OR MINISTRIES AND SEMINARIANS STUDYING AT ST. JOSEPHS SEMINARY IN YONKERS, NEW YORK. THE SEMINARIANS WILL BE THE SERVERS AND, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THEYRE THRILLED, FATHER ERNEST SAID. WERE PUTTING ALL THE SEMINARIANS TO WORK. THEYRE NOT SIMPLY ATTENDING THE EVENT. SOME ARE SINGING, SOME ARE SERVING, SOME WILL DIRECT TRAFFIC IN THE HALLS. JENNIFER DONELSON, DIRECTOR OF SACRED MUSIC AT THE SEMINARY, SAID 10 SEMINARIANS FROM THE SCHOOLS SCHOLA CHOIR WILL SING THE COMMUNION ANTIPHON. FATHER ERNEST SAID THE VATICAN MADE FEW REQUESTS BEYOND KEEPING THE LITURGY SIMPLE. THE VATICAN ASKED THAT THE GIFTS BE PRESENTED BY A MULTIGENERATIONAL FAMILY, HE SAID. INITIAL PLANNING FOR THE PAPAL MASS BEGAN IN APRIL, FATHER ERNEST SAID. HE CONSULTED WITH THE PRIEST WHO PLANNED POPE BENEDICT XVIS MASS IN WASHINGTON IN 2008. VOLUNTEERS WERE RECRUITED AND COMMITTEES FORMED. FATHER ERNEST PRAISED THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO REVIEW THE EVENTS DETAILS. THIS IS MASS ON A STAGE. IT REQUIRES FORETHOUGHT WITH REGARD TO THE MOVEMENT AND PLACEMENT OF PEOPLE, HE SAID. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS PROVIDING FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF HOLY COMMUNION TO 20,000 PEOPLE, FATHER ERNEST SAID. MORE THAN 200 PERMANENT DEACONS FROM THE ARCHDIOCESE AND THE DIOCESES OF BROOKLYN AND ROCKVILLE CENTRE WILL BE DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AS EUCHARISTIC MINISTERS. THEY WILL BE ASSISTED BY 150 VOLUNTEERS FROM GROUPS INCLUDING THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS, KNIGHTS OF MALTA, KNIGHTS OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE AND ANCIENT ORDER OF HIBERNIANS. FATHER ERNEST SAID IMMIGRANT WOMEN FROM THE OBREROS UNIDOS MISSION IN YONKERS ARE EMBROIDERING THE ALTAR LINENS AND PURIFICATORS. MANY OF THE ITEMS USED AT THE MASS MAY LOOK FAMILIAR. THE SIMPLE CIBORIA WILL BE THE SAME DESIGN AS THOSE USED FOR POPE BENEDICT XVIS MASS AT YANKEE STADIUM. THEIR LIDS HAVE A COMMEMORATIVE INSCRIPTION AND THE SIDES BEAR THE PAPAL COAT OF ARMS AND THE SEAL OF THE ARCHDIOCESE. AS IN 2008, THEY WILL BE GIVEN TO NEW YORK PARISHES AFTER THE VISIT. POPE FRANCIS WILL USE THE SAME CHALICE POPE BLESSED PAUL VI USED WHEN HE CELEBRATED MASS IN YANKEE STADIUM OCT. 4, 1965. IT IS CURRENTLY ON DISPLAY AT ST. JOSEPHS SEMINARY. CARDINAL DOLAN SAID THE HOLY FATHER WILL CARRY A PASTORAL STAFF THAT IS A REPLICA OF ONE USED IN NEW YORK BY PAUL VI, JOHN PAUL II AND BENEDICT XVI. SPEAKING COURTSIDE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, THE CARDINAL UNVEILED THE OAK PRESIDERS CHAIR POPE FRANCIS WILL USE AT THE MASS. IT WAS BUILT BY IMMIGRANT DAY LABORERS FROM THE DON BOSCO WORKERS, INC. IN PORT CHESTER, NEW YORK. THE CHAIR IS VERY IMPORTANT IN CATHOLIC IMAGINATION, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID. IT IS A GREAT SYMBOL OF UNITY AND THE TEACHING AUTHORITY THE POPE HAS. HE DESCRIBED THE WOODEN CHAIR AS VERY SIMPLE, WITH NO DESIGNS, ACCORDING WITH THE WISHES OF THE POPE. JENNIFER PASCUAL, DIRECTOR OF MUSIC AT ST. PATRICKS CATHEDRAL, TOLD CNS THAT THE MUSIC FOR THE MASS WILL BE PROVIDED UNDER HER DIRECTION BY 115 MEMBERS OF TWO CHOIRS NEW YORK ARCHDIOCESAN FESTIVAL CHORALE AND THE CATHEDRAL CHOIR OF ST. PATRICKS AND A 40-PERSON ORCHESTRA. THE ORCHESTRA IS BEING ASSEMBLED WITH THE HELP OF A CONTRACTOR, SHE SAID, AND IS COMPRISED OF A LOT OF FAITH-FILLED PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCITED TO BE HERE. PASCUAL COMMISSIONED SOME MUSIC, BUT GENERALLY CHOSE PIECES THAT WILL BE FAMILIAR TO THE WORSHIPPERS AND ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION. SOME OF THE SELECTIONS ARE MULTILINGUAL. IM TRYING TO MAKE IT AS CONGREGATIONAL-FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE, SHE SAID. SEPTEMBER 3, 2015 ADMIN COMMENTS OFF ON POPE TO CELEBRATE SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS FOR 20,000 AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
545	PEYTON MANNING'S SUMMER WAS BOTH DAZZLING AND PERPLEXING. PRACTICES CONSISTED OF SPRINT-OUTS, ROLL-OUTS AND BOOTLEGS FROM UNDER CENTER, PLAY-ACTION PASSES FROM THE PISTOL FORMATION AND SCRAMBLES FOR FIRST DOWNS IN DEFIANCE OF HIS 39-YEAR-OLD LEGS. PRESEASON GAMES WERE FILLED WITH EMPTY BACKFIELDS AND SHOTGUN FORMATIONS THAT PRODUCED A PAUCITY OF POINTS AND PLENTY OF ANGST AMONG BRONCOS FANS AND FANTASY FOOTBALL OWNERS ALIKE. WHICH MANNING SHOWS UP SUNDAY IS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE. "THE LAST THREE YEARS HE'S BEEN HERE, THERE WERE (PRESEASON) GAMES WE DIDN'T SCORE POINTS AND WE'D COME OUT AND SCORE 35, 42 POINTS" IN THE OPENER, WIDE RECEIVER DEMARYIUS THOMAS SAID. "SO, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BY DESIGN OR NOT, BUT IT HAPPENS." IF MANNING IS CONCERNED THAT HE DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN AUGUST, HE DIDN'T SHOW IT WEDNESDAY. "HEY, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SUNDAY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM," MANNING SAID.  I'VE SAID ALL ALONG THE KEY FOR US IS TO IMPROVE THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF A GAME. "BALTIMORE'S AN EXCELLENT DEFENSE. ARE YOU GOING TO DOMINATE ALL FOUR QUARTERS? I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S EVER DONE THAT AGAINST BALTIMORE, BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WIN ENOUGH PLAYS AND BE EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO WIN THE FOOTBALL GAME." RAVENS COACH JOHN HARBAUGH SAID ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES HE'S FACING THIS WEEK AS HE PREPARES FOR THE OPENER WAS FIGURING OUT HOW BRONCOS COACH GARY KUBIAK, HIS FORMER OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WAS ADAPTING HIS SCHEME TO FIT MANNING'S SKILLS. "THE TEAMS THAT PLAY HIM IN WEEK 3 AND 4 AND 5 AND 6 AND DOWN THE ROAD WILL HAVE A BETTER FEEL FOR THAT THAN WE WILL," HARBAUGH SAID. "I'M SURE THAT THEY DIDN'T SHOW IN THE PRESEASON EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE PLANNING ON DOING." THE BRONCOS SHOWED ALMOST NOTHING IN THE PRESEASON, IN PART BECAUSE MANNING NEVER HAD PRO BOWL RECEIVERS THOMAS AND EMMANUEL SANDERS TOGETHER WITH HIM ON THE FIELD. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO USE TRAINING CAMP TO GET A FEEL FOR THE FUTURE. GENERAL MANAGER JOHN ELWAY SAID HE LIKED WHAT HE SAW IN BROCK OSWEILER, WHO'S ENTERING HIS FOURTH SEASON AS MANNING'S BACKUP.  MANNING MADE CAMEOS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD EXHIBITION GAMES AND DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN NINE FULL POSSESSIONS. HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PLAYED MORE AND BETTER BUT WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS PREPARATION FOR HIS 18TH NFL SEASON. HARBAUGH MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO EXPECT SUNDAY, BUT HE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF KUBIAK AND HIS TOP LIEUTENANT, RICK DENNISON, LAST YEAR, RAVENS QUARTERBACK JOE FLACCO HAD THE BEST SEASON OF HIS SEVEN-YEAR CAREER. "I'M SURE THAT PEYTON IS HAVING A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM," FLACCO SAID. "... THEY JUST HELPED ME PLAY FAST, PLAY WITH A QUIET MIND, BE CONFIDENT AND MAKE QUICK DECISIONS. I THINK THAT OUR LINE PLAYED REALLY WELL LAST YEAR UNDER THEIR PROTECTION SCHEME AND I THINK THAT HELPED OUT A TON." THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR MANNING, WHO HAS FOUR NEW O-LINEMEN, INCLUDING TWO NOVICES IN LEFT TACKLE TY SAMBRAILO AND CENTER MATT PARADIS. RAVENS RUNNING BACK JUSTIN FORSETT WENT FROM JOURNEYMAN TO PRO BOWLER IN KUBIAK'S ZONE BLOCKING SCHEME LAST YEAR, AND HARBAUGH SAID DENVER PRO BOWLER C.J. ANDERSON SHOULD BE IN FOR A SIMILARLY SPECTACULAR SEASON. "HE'S A DOWNHILL, ONE-CUT, VERY PHYSICAL GUY," HARBAUGH SAID. "DIFFERENT KINDS OF BACKS ARE GOOD IN THIS SCHEME, BUT THEY'VE GOT TWO OF THEM. RONNIE HILLMAN DOES IT DIFFERENTLY THAN C.J.  ONCE THE SONG CONCLUDED AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT ALL MARRIED COUPLES MUST REPORT TO THE DANCE FLOOR FOR A VERY SPECIAL TRIBUTE. DOES IT. I THINK THEY'VE GOT TWO GUYSWITH DIFFERENT STYLES THAT RUN THE SCHEME VERY WELL." NOTES: PLAYERS VOTED MANNING, DE DEMARCUS WARE AND S DAVID BRUTON JR. AS TEAM CAPTAINS. ... DE KENNY ANUNIKE (KNEE) WAS THE ONLY PLAYER TO SIT OUT PRACTICE. --- AP NFL WEBSITE: WWW.PRO32.AP.ORG AND WWW.TWITTER.COM/AP-NFL
546	RUSSIA WILL DELIVER ITS CUTTING-EDGE LONG-RANGE ANTI-TANK GUIDED MISSILE SYSTEMS TO FOREIGN ARMS CUSTOMERS. THE KREMLIN HAS REACHED A NUMBER OF CONTRACTS TO SELL THE KORNET-EM LONG-RANGE ANTI-TANK GUIDED MISSILE SYSTEMS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES, ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER OF THE MISSILE SYSTEM. IMAGE SOURCE: VITALY V. KUZMIN THE AGREEMENTS ON DELIVERY OF KORNET-EM [MISSILE] COMPLEX TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN ALREADY CONCLUDED, AN OFFICIAL FROM THE INSTRUMENT DESIGN BUREAU (KBP) TOLD RIA NOVOSTI DURING THE RAE-2015 MILITARY EXHIBITION ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER, THE OFFICIAL DID NOT SHED ANY LIGHT AS TO WHICH COUNTRIES RUSSIA REACHED AGREEMENTS WITH.  THE KORNET SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF FIRING TWO MISSILES SIMULTANEOUSLY AT ONE TARGET FOR HIGH ELIMINATION PROBABILITY. MEANWHILE, THE MISSILE WITH A HIGH-EXPLOSIVE WARHEAD CAN ELIMINATE AIRCRAFT TARGETS SUCH AS HELICOPTER AND DRONES. THE MUCH DESIRED BY FOREIGN CUSTOMERS MISSILE SYSTEM WAS SHOWCASED AT THE MAKS AIRSHOW IN AUGUST 2011. THE MAKS 2015 AIRSHOW INCLUDED SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, DRONES, HELICOPTERS AND OTHER BRAND NEW AIRCRAFT, WHICH KEPT RUSSIAN MILITARY MINDS OCCUPIED FOR SEVERAL YEARS IF NOT DECADES. THE COMPANY (KBP) IS A KEY RUSSIAN MANUFACTURER OF HIGH-PRECISION WEAPONS, GRENADE LAUNCHERS AS WELL AS MODERN AIRCRAFT GUNS.  SANCTIONS DID NOTHING TO RUSSIAS ARMS EXPORTS ROSOBORONEXPORT, AN INTERMEDIARY AGENCY FOR RUSSIAS EXPORTS/IMPORTS OF ARMS, HAS STATED THAT U.S. SANCTIONS HAVE NOT AFFECTED ARMS EXPORT OF RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTINS COUNTRY. WE HAVE NO DOUBTS OF FULFILLING THE PLAN FOR THIS YEAR, DEPUTY CEO OF ROSOBORONEXPORT SERGEI GORESLAVSKIY TOLD RUSSIAN STATE-OWNED ITAR-TASS . HE ADDED THAT WESTERN SANCTIONS HAVE NOT AFFECTED RUSSIAS ARMS EXPORT. IT WAS EARLIER REPORTED THAT THE COMPANY IS PLANNING TO DELIVER ABROAD MILITARY WEAPONRY AND HARDWARE FOR THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF AT LEAST $13 BILLION. OVER THE PAST YEAR, BACK WHEN WESTERN SANCTIONS DID NOT TARGET RUSSIAS ARMS MANUFACTURING AND EXPORTING FIRMS, ROSOBORONEXPORT EXPORTED ARMS FOR THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF $13.2 BILLION. RUSSIA IS ALSO RECEIVING MORE OFFERS FROM FOREIGN PARTNERS IN LEASING RUSSIAN MILITARY HARDWARE, ACCORDING TO GORESLAVSKIY.  THIS WILL ASSIST IN MITIGATING ANY POTENTIAL UNPLANNED DRAW FROM RESERVES. IN COLLABORATION WITH NEW DELHI, MOSCOW IS DEVELOPING RUSSIAN HELICOPTER KA-226T IN INDIA. THIS MODEL OF THE HELICOPTER CAN BE USED DURING RESCUE OPERATIONS IN INACCESSIBLE HIGH-MOUNTAIN AREAS OF INDIA.  THERES TEST THE WATERS IN WHICH I WATCH THE FIRST ONE OR TWO EPISODES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SHOW WILL BE ANY GOOD. RUSSIA IS PUSHING ITS HARDWARE TO INTERNATIONAL MARKET OVER 15 YEARS SINCE ROSOBORONEXPORT WAS FOUNDED, THE VOLUME OF EXPORTS OF ARMS FOR GROUND FORCES HAS INCREASED BY TEN TIMES. WE CONFIDENTLY COMPETE WITH LEADING DEVELOPERS AND CAN OFFER THE MARKET OUR COMPLEX, ALL-INCLUSIVE SOLUTIONS IN THE FIELD OF NATIONAL SECURITY, GORESLAVSKIY NOTED. ACCORDING TO HIM, THE COMPANY IS PUSHING OVER 700 UNITS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. THE MAJOR CONTRACTS FOR ARMS DEVELOPED BY RUSSIA INCLUDE: THE DELIVERY OF T-90C TANKS TO INDIA AND AZERBAIJAN, THE BMP-3 FIGHTING VEHICLE TO AZERBAIJAN AND INDONESIA, SELF-PROPELLED ARTILLERY AND HEAVY FLAME-THROWING SYSTEMS TO IRAQ AND AZERBAIJAN, WEAPON SUPPLIES TO INDIA AND UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, ENGINEER EQUIPMENT TO IRAQ AS WELL AS ANTI-TANK COMPLEXES TO BAHREIN AND NAMIBIA. ALSO, RUSSIA IS WORKING ON MODERNIZING A NUMBER OF PREVIOUSLY DELIVERED HARDWARE, INCLUDING THE ONES IT DELIVERED TO ALGERIA. THE 10TH RUSSIA ARMS EXPO RAE-2015 INTERNATIONAL ARMS SHOW OPENED IN THE URAL CITY OF NIZHNY TAGIL ON SEPTEMBER 9 AND WILL RUN THROUGH SEPTEMBER 12. THE MOST PROMINENT SHOWCASES TOOK PLACE ON AN OPEN TRAINING RANGE OF OVER 400,000 SQUARE METERS, WHICH ALLOWED RUSSIAN MILITARIES TO SHOW OFF COMBAT AND OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MILITARY HARDWARE IN REAL TIME. RUSSIA ARMS EXPO RAE-2015 ORGANIZERS EARLIER SAID THAT THE SHOW WOULD BE ATTENDED BY AT LEAST 65 FOREIGN DELEGATIONS.  A BRACE FROM THOMAS MLLER SANDWICHED A LASHED EFFORT FROM SUBSTITUTE MARIO GTZE TO ENSURE THE GERMAN CHAMPIONS WALKED AWAY WITH ALL THREE POINTS. THE SHOW ALSO INCLUDES BRAND NEW RUSSIAN ARMORED VEHICLE MODELS SUCH AS THE T-14 ARMATA MAIN BATTLE TANK AND HEAVY BMP T-15 ON THE ARMATA PLATFORM. LEAKED DETAILS OF RUSSIAS MILITARY DELIVERIES TO SYRIA DETAILS OF THE DELIVERIES OF RUSSIAN ARMS TO THE BASHAR AL-ASSAD REGIME IN SYRIA HAVE SURFACED IN THE RUSSIAN MEDIA.  OOH! RUSSIA HAS CONFIRMED PROVIDING MILITARY AID TO SYRIA AND THE PRESENCE OF ITS MILITARY EXPERTS IN THE COUNTRY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN KOMMERSANT NEWSPAPER . AS OF TODAY, RUSSIA IS HOLDING TALKS WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO REACH AGREEMENTS ON THE DELIVERY OF A FEW BATCHES OF SMALL ARMS, GRENADE LAUNCHERS, THE BTR-82A ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS, THE URAL MILITARY VEHICLES AS WELL AS OTHER WEAPONRY NEEDED FOR LOCAL MILITARY ACTIONS AND DEPLOYING THE SYRIAN ARMY TO DIFFERENT SPOTS OF THE COUNTRY, ACCORDING TO SOURCES CITED BY KOMMERSANT.  WASHINGTON CONSIDERS ANY MILITARY AID FROM RUSSIA TO THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT UNACCEPTABLE, ACCORDING TO THE SPOKESMAN FOR U.S. EMBASSY TO RUSSIA, WILLIAM STEVENS. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE TO PROVIDE THE ASSAD REGIME WITH ANY SUPPORT, AS IT ALLOWS ASSAD TO AVOID FINDING THE SOLUTION TO END THE CONFLICT, STEVENS SAID. HE ADDED THAT INSTEAD OF HELPING SYRIAN PEOPLE TO JOIN THE FIGHT AGAINST EXTREMISM AND ISIS, RUSSIA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE REGIME THAT GIVES THE GROWTH TO EXTREMISM IN THE REGION. WHEN ASKED BY KOMMERSANT NEWSPAPER WHY THE WEST DOES NOT WANT TO JOIN ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT, STEVENS SAID THAT WE ARE ALREADY WAGING A WAR AGAINST ISIS WITH 60 FOREIGN COALITION PARTNERS.  ALLY IN THIS WAR. BIPOLAR WORLD WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA ON ONE SIDE VALUEWALK EARLIER REPORTED THAT MOSCOW HAS PLANS TO TAKE OVER THE MIDDLE EAST WITH ITS ARMS. THE KREMLIN IS CURRENTLY INTERESTED IN REACHING MILITARY CONTRACTS WITH EGYPT, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN AND PAKISTAN.  FOLLOWING THAT, ALL DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD THEN GO TO ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS, IT SAID. SAUDI ARABIA IS REPORTEDLY PLANNING TO PURCHASE RUSSIAN WEAPONS TO REPLACE U.S. WEAPONS IN THE COUNTRY, WHILE IRAN IS WAITING FOR RUSSIAS DELIVERY OF THE S-300 ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEMS BY THE END OF 2015. PAKISTAN, A TRADITIONAL RIVAL OF RUSSIA, IS PURCHASING RUSSIAS MI-35 COMBAT HELICOPTERS ALONG WITH THE KLIMOV RD-93 ENGINES FOR ITS JF-17 MULTI-ROLE FIGHTERS. ITS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PAKISTAN REQUIRES CHINAS ENGINEERS AND HELP IN CO-PRODUCTION AND CO-DEVELOPMENT OF JF-17 FIGHTER JETS. GIVEN THE WARMING RELATIONS BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND RUSSIA, THERE ARE INDICATIONS OF THE EMERGENCE OF THE WORLDS NEW SUPERPOWER AXIS BETWEEN RUSSIA, PAKISTAN AND CHINA , WHICH WORRIES WASHINGTON.

548	MORE PUBLIC SERVICE NEWS FINANCE DEPARTMENT SECRETARY JANE HALTON SAYS IT IS TIME TO SLASH THE AMOUNT OF DUPLICATED INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES MUST GATHER FOR PERFORMANCE REPORTING. MS HALTON SAID RED TAPE NEEDED TO BE CURTAILED BY PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO OFTEN CREATED IT THEMSELVES, SEEMINGLY OUT OF THIN AIR. SHE SAID ONE PUBLIC SERVANT SHE KNEW THOUGHT HE NEEDED THREE QUOTES BEFORE SPENDING $100 ON A CREDIT CARD WHEN IN FACT HE DID NOT. "SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE HAS DECIDED THAT'S WHAT THE RULES ARE AND THAT HAS BECOME LOCAL MYTH," MS HALTON SAID. "IT'S NOT DONE FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN GOOD INTENTIONS." SPEAKING TO AN AUDIENCE OF PUBLIC SERVANTS AT A DINNER TO MARK THE START OF THE FIRST INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ACT CONFERENCE, SHE SAID INFORMATION PROVIDED IN ANNUAL REPORTS - NOW MUCH THICKER THAN THEY WERE 30 YEARS AGO - "DID NOT ADD TO THE SUM OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE". MS HALTON ALSO REVEALED AS HEALTH DEPARTMENT SECRETARY SHE "HAD WORDS" WITH JOE HOCKEY, WHEN HE WAS SHADOW TREASURER, ABOUT FACTUALLY INCORRECT CLAIMS HE MADE REGARDING ALLEGED FEDERAL-STATE DUPLICATION. IN 2012 HE WAS OFTEN QUOTED AS SAYING "THERE'S A DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN CANBERRA WITH OVER 6000 EMPLOYEES - NOT ONE OF THEM IS A DOCTOR OR NOT ONE OF THEM IS A NURSE TREATING A PATIENT". IN FACT THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC SERVANTS WAS NOT AS HIGH AS 6000 AND A NUMBER OF THEM WERE DOCTORS. "I THINK IT WAS A RHETORICAL FLOURISH," MS HALTON SAID. SHE BALANCED THIS BY SAYING IT WAS FAIR TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE BECAUSE EXPERIENCE HAD SHOWN IT WAS EASY FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE WORKFORCE TO ESCALATE. TREASURY SECRETARY JOHN FRASER, BROUGHT FROM GLOBAL ASSET MANAGER UBS EIGHT MONTHS AGO, SAID THE "RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY" IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE "STILL GETS YOU DOWN AT TIMES" BUT HE FELT AS THOUGH PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE. HE CREDITED PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONER JOHN LLOYD WITH MAKING IT EASIER TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RECRUIT STAFF. AT A TIME WHEN THE PUBLIC SERVICE WILL BE LOOKING TO MAKE THE MOST OF TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW IT TO WORK QUICKER, MR FRASER SAID HE WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE AUSTRALIAN BUREAUCRACY TO FIND SOME OF THE OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY USED.
549	THE SPECTACULAR MILITARY PARADE CHINA THAT IS TO BE STAGED HERE THURSDAY CARRIES MANY MESSAGES, YET ALL OF THEM HAIL FROM ONE BASIC POINT: BEIJING IS STEADFAST IN PURSUING PEACEFUL DEVELOPMENT. SINCE CHINA ANNOUNCED ITS PLAN TO HOLD A MILITARY PARADE TO MARK THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS WORLD WAR II VICTORY, WILD SPECULATIONS HAVE EMERGED LIKE THAT CHINA'S PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO FLEX ITS MUSCLES AT A TIME OF HEIGHTENED TENSIONS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AND WITH NEIGHBORING JAPAN. SUCH GUESSWORK IS WIDE OF THE MARK. CHINA HAS ANNOUNCED STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT THE PARADE WOULD SHOWCASE ITS ADVANCED TANKS, AIRCRAFT, MISSILES AND OTHER MILITARY EQUIPMENT, BUT IT IS HASTY AND UNFOUNDED TO CONCLUDE THAT IT IS AIMED AT INTIMIDATING ANY OTHER COUNTRY. SKEPTICS SHOULD BE REMINDED THAT IT IS A LONG-RUNNING TRADITION FOR COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TO PUT THEIR LATEST HI-TECH ARMAMENT ON DISPLAY AT MILITARY PARADES. AS FOR THE CLAIM THAT CHINA INTENDS THE EVENT AS A SABER-RATTLING OCCASION TO INSTILL FEAR, IT IS NOTHING BUT NONSENSE SINCE CHINA HAS ALWAYS INSISTED ON RESOLVING DISPUTES VIA PEACEFUL MEANS AND MADE VARIOUS TENSION-MITIGATING INITIATIVES. THE CHINESE MILITARY HAS INDEED WITNESSED RAPID GROWTH OF ITS CAPABILITIES IN RECENT YEARS. HOWEVER, CHINA'S NEWLY-GAINED MILITARY MIGHT IS NO REASON FOR ALARM. CHINA FOLLOWS A DEFENSE POLICY THAT IS DEFENSIVE IN NATURE; IT PROMISES IN ITS DEFENSE WHITE PAPERS NOT TO STRIKE FIRST. THE CHINESE MILITARY IS ALSO A FRONT-RUNNER IN GLOBAL PEACE-KEEPING AND HUMANITARIAN MISSIONS. CHINA, TOGETHER WITH MANY OTHER DEVELOPING NATIONS, HAS BENEFITED FROM THE LARGELY PEACEFUL INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN THE PAST FEW DECADES, AND NOW THE COUNTRY, RESOLUTE IN BUILDING A MODERATELY PROSPEROUS SOCIETY BY 2020, NEEDS A PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT ALL THE MORE. A BITTER LESSON THAT CHINA LEARNT FROM THE 14 YEARS OF SUFFERING UNDER JAPANESE INVASION IS THAT PEACE IS NOT TO BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. PEACE CAN BE SECURED ONLY WHEN ONE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFEND ONESELF. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH THE TIAN'ANMEN PARADE IS INDEED A POWERFUL DEMONSTRATION OF CHINA'S MILITARY DEVELOPMENT, THE ROARING JETS AND RUMBLING TANKS ARE NOT MEANT TO MAKE ANY OTHER COUNTRY FEEL THREATENED. INSTEAD, THEY ARE TELLING THE WORLD LOUD AND CLEAR THAT CHINA CHERISHES PEACE AND ITS MILITARY POWER SERVES AS AN EFFECTIVE GUARANTEE OF IT.

551	HARTFORD NEARLY 200 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT OF NOTORIOUS KILLER AMY ARCHER-GILLIGAN, THE WOMAN WHO BECAME THE SUBJECT OF THE PLAY AND MOVIE "ARSENIC AND OLD LACE," WILL REMAIN SEALED AFTER THE STATE SUPREME COURT RULED MONDAY THAT THEY ARE NOT PUBLIC RECORDS. ARCHER-GILLIGAN DIED IN STATE CUSTODY IN 1962 AT WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS CONNECTICUT VALLEY HOSPITAL, WHERE SHE WAS SENTENCED TO LIVE AFTER A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE RULED HER CRIMINALLY INSANE IN 1924. ARCHER-GILLIGAN, WHO RAN A WINDSOR HOME FOR THE ELDERLY, WAS ACCUSED OF MURDERING RESIDENTS. THE STATE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION COMMISSION HAD PREVIOUSLY RULED THAT SOME OF ARCHER-GILLIGAN'S MEDICAL AND DENTAL RECORDS FROM THE 38 YEARS SHE SPENT AT CVH, SHOULD BE RELEASED. THEY WERE REQUESTED BY AN EAST HARTFORD MAN WRITING A BOOK ABOUT ARCHER-GILLIGAN, WHO WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR THE 1939 PLAY AND THE FRANK CAPRA MOVIE SEVERAL YEARS LATER. A TRIAL JUDGE AFFIRMED THE FOIC DECISION. ARCHER-GILLIGAN PLEADED GUILTY TO POISONING AT LEAST ONE MAN WHO LIVED AT HER WINDSOR NURSING HOME BY SLIPPING ARSENIC INTO HIS FOOD. INVESTIGATORS SUSPECTED AT LEAST THREE MORE VICTIMS AND POSSIBLY DOZENS MORE DIED OF ARSENIC POISONING AT THE ARCHER HOME FOR ELDERLY AND INDIGENT PERSONS AT 37 PROSPECT ST., BETWEEN 1907 AND 1916. HER ONLY CHILD IS ALSO DEAD, LEAVING NO KNOWN RELATIVES. THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTIVE SERVICES, WHICH RUNS THE HOSPITAL, AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FOUGHT THE RELEASE OF THE DOCUMENTS, ARGUING THAT THEY ARE PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS AND EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE UNDER STATE LAW. SINCE ARCHER-GILLIGAN HAS NO LIVING RELATIVES, THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION AS STEWARD OF THE RECORDS TO KEEP THEM SEALED, THEY ARGUED. THEY ALSO RAISED CONCERNS THAT RELEASING THE RECORDS COULD SET A PRECEDENT. IN THE MAJORITY OPINION, FIVE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AGREED THAT ALL OF THE RECORDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS AND THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED BY SEPARATING OUT HER DENTAL AND MEDICAL RECORDS. "WE CONCLUDE THAT THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY AFFIRMED THE [FOI] COMMISSION'S DETERMINATION THAT GILLIGAN'S MEDICAL AND DENTAL RECORDS WERE NOT EXEMPT," JUSTICE DENNIS G. EVELEIGH WROTE IN AN 18-PAGE DECISION. "OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BROAD VEIL OF SECRECY CREATED BY THE PSYCHIATRIST-PATIENT PRIVILEGE ALSO SUPPORTS OUR CONCLUSION THAT MEDICAL AND DENTAL RECORDS THAT ARE CREATED BY AN INPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY DURING THE TREATMENT OF A PATIENT ARE EXEMPT." IN A SEPARATE OPINION, JUSTICE ANDREW J. MCDONALD TOOK ISSUE WITH THE MAJORITY'S CONCLUSION THAT ALL THE RECORDS CREATED AT THE INPATIENT TREATMENT FACILITY ARE, AS A MATTER OF LAW, PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS. "THIS HEAVY-HANDED APPROACH DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS ARE NOT MEDICAL AND DENTAL RECORDS AT ALL, BUT ARE MERELY ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS AND CORRESPONDENCE HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH GILLIGAN'S PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT," MCDONALD WROTE. THE JUSTICES HAD SPENT MORE THAN AN HOUR QUESTIONING THE LAWYERS WHEN THE CASE CAME BEFORE THEM. THEIR QUESTIONS TOUCHED ON WHAT DEFINES A PUBLIC FIGURE AND WHY PATIENTS IN STATE MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS OF PRIVACY THAN THOSE IN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. THEY ALSO ASKED IF THE STATE EVEN HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RECORDS OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN DEAD FOR SO LONG AND HAS NO HEIRS SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC. ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL JACQUELINE HOELL ARGUED THAT THE MORE THAN 200 PAGES ARE PRIVILEGED PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS AND SHOULD REMAIN SEALED, JUST LIKE THEY WOULD BE FOR ANY OTHER PATIENT, WHETHER UNDER THE STATE'S CARE OR IN A PRIVATE FACILITY. "LEGITIMATE PUBLIC CONCERN FOR HOW SOMEONE IS TREATED IS NOT THE EQUIVALENT TO CURIOSITY AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS CASE," HOELL SAID. HOELL ARGUED THAT RELEASING ARCHER-GILLIGAN'S RECORDS WOULD SET A PRECEDENT THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY APPLY TO ANYONE TREATED AT A STATE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY. HOELL REPRESENTED THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. VALICIA DEE HARMON, THE COMMISSION'S ATTORNEY, ARGUED THAT THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF PUBLIC INTEREST IN ARCHER-GILLIGAN, 52 YEARS AFTER HER DEATH, AND THAT HER MEDICAL RECORDS WOULD PROVIDE A SNAPSHOT INTO THE TREATMENT GIVEN TO A HISTORICAL FIGURE. HARMON ALSO ARGUED THAT NO ONE WOULD BE HARMED BY THE RELEASE OF THE RECORDS SINCE THERE IS NO NEXT OF KIN. WRITER RON ROBILLARD FILED THE FOI REQUEST SEEKING ALL OF ARCHER-GILLIGAN'S PSYCHIATRIC AND MEDICAL RECORDS. HE IS WRITING A BOOK ABOUT ARCHER-GILLIGAN AND IS TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THE STATE TREATED THE MENTALLY ILL 90 YEARS AGO. THE STATE ORIGINALLY TOLD ROBILLARD THAT THE RECORDS HAD BEEN DESTROYED BUT THEY WERE LATER DISCOVERED IN A VAULT IN THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AT THE HOSPITAL. "I AM OBVIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED, BUT CAN'T SAY THAT I AM SURPRISED," ROBILLARD SAID. HE SAID THE DECISION LIKELY ENDS HIS PROJECT TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT ARCHER-GILLIGAN. "WITHOUT THOSE RECORDS I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO WRITE THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT HER," HE SAID. "THE NEW STUFF WAS HOW HER ILLNESS WAS DIAGNOSED AND HOW THEY TREATED HER."

552	EVERYONE FROM MILITARY AFICIONADOS TO KIDS WHO DIG COOL TRUCKS LINED THE STREETS OF HISTORIC DOWNTOWN VILLA RICA THURSDAY EVENING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE MILITARY VEHICLE PRESERVATION ASSOCIATION 2015 BANKHEAD HIGHWAY CROSS-COUNTRY CONVOY.THE CONVOY, CONSISTING OF ABOUT 65 MILITARY VEHICLES AND MOVING AT TOP SPEEDS OF 35 MILES PER HOUR, IS TRAVELING FROM WASHINGTON TO SAN DIEGO AND STOPPED IN VILLA RICA ON THURSDAY NIGHT AT THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF VILLA RICA, WHERE THEY WERE GREETED BY APPROXIMATELY 1,500 PEOPLE. MILITARY VEHICLE FANS WERE INVITED TO THE CHURCH TO GET AN UP-CLOSE-AND-PERSONAL LOOK AT THE REFURBISHED AND UNIQUE VEHICLES.VILLA RICA MAYOR J. COLLINS ADDRESSED THE CROWD, SAYING HIS CITY WAS PROUD TO HOST THE GROUP. DOESNT IT SAY A LOT ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE CAN GATHER HERE AT THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF VILLA RICA AND CELEBRATE OUR COUNTRY, HE SAID. ITS A NIGHT THAT WERE THANKFUL TO BE VILLA RICANS, WERE THANKFUL TO BE AMERICANS AND WERE THANKFUL FOR THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH AND THEIR GRACIOUS HOSPITALITY HERE.THE CHURCHS PASTOR, KEVIN WILLIAMS, WHO IS ALSO A VETERAN OF THE MILITARY POLICE, SAID HE WAS AMAZED AT THE SIZE OF THE CROWD. IM PROUD WE COULD HAVE THEM HERE, HE SAID. WILLIAMS AND VOLUNTEERS AT THE CHURCH HANDED OUT BIBLES WITH A LETTER INSIDE, DATED JAN. 25, 1941, FROM PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT.I TAKE GREAT PLEASURE IN COMMENDING THE READING OF THE BIBLE TO ALL WHO SERVE IN THE ARMED FORCES, THE LETTER READS.THE TRIP THROUGH VILLA RICA RETRACED THE APPROXIMATE ROUTE TAKEN BY THE U.S. ARMY IN ITS 6920 TRANSCONTINENTAL MOTOR CONVOY, TRAVELING FROM WASHINGTON TO SAN DIEGO ALONG THE BANKHEAD HIGHWAY.THE CONVOY ARRIVED IN VILLA RICA AT ABOUT 6:30 P.M. ON THURSDAY AND HAD A POLICE ESCORT FROM THE DOUGLAS COUNTY LINE ON BANKHEAD HIGHWAY.IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIN, STATE SEN. MIKE DUGAN, R-CARROLLTON, SAID. THERE WERE MILITARY VEHICLES FROM MULTIPLE ERAS.  I WAS ALSO VERY PROUD THAT THEY SAID OURS WAS THE LARGEST RECEPTION THEYVE RECEIVED YET. THE GROUP WAS EXPECTED THIS MORNING TO START BACK AGAIN ON ITS 3,300 MILE JOURNEY ONE THAT WILL TAKE 29 DAYS TO COMPLETE.IN 1920, THE ARMY DECIDED TO PLAN AND EXECUTE A MOTOR CONVOY OF VARIOUS MILITARY VEHICLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON THE NEWLY FORMED BANKHEAD HIGHWAY. THIS CONVOY WAS A FOLLOW-ON PROJECT TO THE 1916 U.S. ARMY TRANSCONTINENTAL MOTOR CONVOY THE FIRST-EVER CONVOY ACROSS THE U.S. ALONG THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY.  THEY ISSUED AN OUTPERFORM RATING AND A $10.00 PRICE TARGET FOR THE COMPANY. THE ARMY WAS DETERMINED TO FURTHER ITS UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRACTICALITY OF A MOTORIZED TRANSPORT AND ITS PLACE IN THE ARMY. THAT CONVOY WAS COMMANDED BY COL. JOHN F. FRANKLIN. THE 1920 ROUTE BEGAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND ENDED AT BALBOA PARK, IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, 116 DAYS LATER.
553	THE RISK OF ENDURING ANOTHER PREMATURE BIRTH IS VERY REAL FOR MARTINE*, WHO IS SIX MONTHS PREGNANT WITH HER SECOND CHILD. HER FIRST WAS BORN SEVEN WEEKS TOO EARLY AFTER A BEATING FROM HER EX-PARTNER FORCED HER INTO A HOSPITAL BED AND CONSEQUENTLY LABOUR. SIX YEARS LATER MARTINE, 29, HAS A NEW RELATIONSHIP AND A NEW BABY ON THE WAY BUT THE ABUSE HAS NOT STOPPED FROM HER EX-PARTNER, WHO CONTINUES TO HARASS HER DAILY. MARTINE IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY WOMEN IN AUSTRALIA WHOSE PREGNANCY HAS TRIGGERED YEARS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST THEM AND THEIR CHILD. DESPITE LEAVING THE MAN WHO BEAT HER INTO EARLY LABOUR, MARTINE FEARS HIS CONSTANT HARASSMENT COULD FORCE ANOTHER PREMATURE BIRTH. "HE HAS THREATENED MY LIFE, KILLED ANIMALS IN MY YARD, THREATENS ANY NEW RELATIONSHIP I START TO THE POINT WHERE PARTNERS HAVE LEFT ME," SHE SAYS. MARTINE HAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORDER IN PLACE, BUT SAYS HER EX-PARTNER HAS CHANGED HIS METHODS OF HARASSMENT TO AVOID GETTING CAUGHT. "MY TYRES HAVE BEEN LET DOWN, HIS CAR CONSTANTLY DRIVES PAST MY HOME, AND I KEEP GETTING PRIVATE NUMBERS CALLING MY PHONE. JUST THIS MORNING I HAD A CALL AND I KNOW IT'S HIM," SHE SAYS. "I HAVE HAD TO CHANGE MY PHONE NUMBER SIX TIMES." HAVING ALREADY BEEN THROUGH A PRE-TERM BIRTH AND LIVING WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS, MARTINE'S PREGNANCY IS CLASSIFIED AS BEING HIGH-RISK. HOWEVER, AT SIX MONTHS PREGNANT SHE HAS TO DEFEND HERSELF IN COURT FROM HER EX-PARTNER, WHO HAS MADE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT HER FITNESS TO PARENT THEIR CHILD. "I'M SCARED THE STRESS OF ALL THE COURT CASES COULD TRIGGER ANOTHER PRE-TERM LABOUR," SHE SAID. "HE SAID 'I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL YOU DIE SO I CAN PISS ON YOUR GRAVE'. I KNOW HE WANTS ME OUT OF THE PICTURE ANY WAY POSSIBLE." "HE HAS MADE MY LIFE HELL, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY." A STRING OF WOMEN'S DEATHS CAUSED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN EARLY SEPTEMBER HAS PROMPTED MORE WOMEN TO SPEAK OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES. SARAH*, 26, FOUGHT BACK TEARS AS SHE DESCRIBED HEARING ABOUT THE RECENT SPATE OF ATTACKS AGAINST WOMEN. "IT COULD HAVE BEEN ME," SHE SAYS, REFERRING TO KARINA LOCK WHO WAS SHOT DEAD AT A MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT ON THE GOLD COAST. LOCK'S WAS ONE OF THREE LIVES LOST TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN A HORROR WEEK FOR QUEENSLAND. SARAH IS PERMANENTLY DISABLED FROM HER ABUSIVE EX-PARTNER AND, LIKE MANY WOMEN, THE VIOLENCE WAS EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY. "IT JUST DIDN'T STOP. HE PUSHED SO HARD ONE TIME THAT WHEN I HIT THE FLOOR I TORE DISCS IN MY SPINE. I HAD TO HAVE DISC REPLACEMENT AND A SPINAL FUSION. I HAD TO LEARN TO WALK AGAIN," SHE SAYS, HER VOICE BREAKING AS SHE DESCRIBES HER DAILY STRUGGLE. "I WAKE EVERY DAY IN PAIN. I WILL NEVER RUN COMFORTABLY. AND WHEN MY KIDS WANT ME TO PLAY, I CAN'T. I'M IN TOO MUCH PAIN." SARAH SAYS SHE IS HARASSED DAILY AND ADMITS SHE FEARS FOR HER LIFE; SHE SAYS THE POLICE HAVE IGNORED HER CONCERNS. "HE [EX-PARTNER] HAS TOLD ME HE WANTS TO KILL HIS EX-WIFE. HE HAS TOLD ME THE WAYS HE WANTS TO DO IT. BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE POLICE THEY SAID IT'S NORMAL FOR PEOPLE TO SAY THEY WANT TO KILL THEIR EX-PARTNERS, AND IT IS A COMMON FIGURE OF SPEECH." NEARLY A QUARTER OF AUSTRALIAN WOMEN SAY THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME FORM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHILST THEY WERE PREGNANT AND HALF OF THEM EXPERIENCED ABUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING THAT PERIOD. JULIE-ANN, 28, IS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING PREGNANCY. "THE ABUSE BEGAN NINE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS 12 WEEKS PREGNANT," JULIE-ANN SAYS, SPEAKING OUT ABOUT HER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. "THINGS WERE FINE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP UNTIL THE 12 WEEK MARK AND THEN, I DON'T KNOW, IT JUST WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE." STATISTICS SHOW LEAVING AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AND PREGNANCY ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS TIMES FOR A WOMAN EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. JULIE-ANN EXPERIENCED ABUSE FOR NINE AND A HALF YEARS FOLLOWING THE FIRST PREGNANCY THROUGH FEAR OF LEAVING. EVENTUALLY SHE ESCAPED AND MOVED INTERSTATE. "IT FELT SAFER TO STAY," SHE SAYS ABOUT HER NINE YEARS OF ABUSE. "BECAUSE HE WOULD LOSE CONTROL. IF I WAS AWAY I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS, WHAT HE WAS THINKING, OR WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO." FAMILY VIOLENCE ACADEMIC DEBORAH WALSH HAS SPECIFICALLY STUDIED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREGNANCY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SAYS PREGNANCY OFTEN OFFERS HOPE THAT AN ABUSIVE PARTNER WILL CHANGE. "A BABY OFFERS HOPE FOR THE FUTURE AND A HOPE FOR CHANGE," MS WALSH SAID. MS WALSH SAID DUE TO THIS HOPE WOMEN HAVE WHILE PREGNANT MANY PROCESSES INVOLVED IN SCREENING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WOULD NOT BE TOTALLY EFFECTIVE. "WE NEED TO SUPPORT MEN IN OUR COMMUNITY TO MANAGE THEIR FEELINGS APPROPRIATELY, SAFELY, AND NON-VIOLENTLY, IN A WAY THAT IT IS NOT SEEN AS AN ATTACK ON MASCULINITY, BUT INSTEAD A PART OF MASCULINITY," MS WALSH SAID. "UNLESS WE SUPPORT OUR MEN (TO) DEAL WITH THEIR EMOTIONS, FEELINGS AND ASSOCIATED BEHAVIOURS, THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE." DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION CENTRE DIRECTOR AMY COMPTON-KEEN SAID PREGNANCY AND POST-BIRTH WERE BOTH VULNERABLE TIMES FOR WOMEN AND IT WAS COMMON FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO OCCUR AT THESE TIMES. "MANY PREGNANT WOMEN DO NOT REPORT, DISCLOSE, OR SEEK HELP DUE TO FEELING VULNERABLE AND UNCERTAIN OF THE FUTURE," MS COMPTON-KEEN SAID. "THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE MAY INCLUDE PERIODS WHERE THEIR PARTNER IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE, THEIR CHILD, AND BECOMING A PARENT, AND THEY MAY MAKE PROMISES. "THESE PROMISES ARE POWERFUL AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A WOMAN REMAINING IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP." PEOPLE WHO MAY BE DISTRESSED CAN PHONE LIFELINE ON 131 114.

557	ARCHIVED - EVEN THOUGH FASHION DESIGNERS WILL STILL MOCK HER (BUT ONLY AFTER THEY PUT HER IN THE FIRST ROW AT THEIR SHOWS), EVERYTHING SHE WEARS WILL STILL BECOME A TREND BECAUSE ITS ON HER AND SHE HAS MILLIONS OF ADORING FANS, DYING TO REPLICATE HER LOOK. HE TRULY IS THE FASHION GENIUS HE THINKS HE IS KANYYE WESTS SECOND COLLECTION FOR ADIDAS, WHICH DEBUTED AT THE NEW YORK FASHION WEEK 2015, WAS MET WIDELY WITH RIDICULE, BUT HE STILL THINKS HES A FASHION GENIUS. UNSURPRISINGLY, HIS WIFE KIM KARDASHIAN WEST IS OF THE SAME OPINION: HE IS A FASHION GENIUS BECAUSE HE IS THE ONE WHO TURNED HER INTO A FASHION ICON.  HE WAS AN LTTE CADRE AND AN LTTE LEADER AS WELL. THE LATEST VIDEO FROM CNN STYLE (SEE BELOW) FOCUSES ON KIMS RISE FROM DERIDED REALITY STAR TO THE STATUS OF CELEBRITY ALL DESIGNERS WANT TO PUT IN THE FIRST ROW AT THEIR SHOWS. WHILE THE VIDEO UNDERLINES THAT KIMS INCLUSION IN THE HIGKH FASHION WORLD WAS INEVITABLE BECAUSE DESIGNERS HAD STARTED UNDERSTANDING HER POPULARITY (WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH FASHION), SHE LIKES TO THINK ITS BECAUSE OF KANYE. KANYE CHANGED EVERYTHING SHORTLY AFTER KIM AND KANYE WENT PUBLIC WITH THEIR ROMANCE, HIS FIRST CAMEO ON KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS AIRED: IT SHOWED HIM GOING THROUGH HER WARDROBE AND TELLING HER THAT HE WOULD BE DRESSING HER FROM THEN ON. SINCE THEN, KANYE HAS BEEN KIMS STYLIST, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER FIRST PREGNANCY, WHEN SHE SAYS SHE HAD 5 DIFFERENT STYLISTS. THATS SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HORRIBLE SARTORIAL CHOICES SHE MADE THEN. TODAY, KIM KARDASHIAN IS WIDELY CONSIDERED A FASHION ICON, EVEN THOUGH MOST OF HER OUTFITS STILL PROVIDE CELEBRITY BLOGGERS WITH THE BEST JOKE MATERIAL POSSIBLE. I REALLY THINK TAHAT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY HUSBAND KANYE REALLY CHANGED EVERYTHING, KIM SAYS. I MEAN, BACK IN THE DAY I THOUGHT I HAD THE BEST STYLE. I LOOK BACK AT OUTFITS AND I'M, LIKE, MORTIFIED. KANYE SEES WHATS OUT THERE ON THJE STREETS AND JUST KNOWS HOW TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO SOMETHING THAT WOULD LOOK GOOD ON ME. JUST HELPING ME PUSH MY LIMINTS A LITTLE BIT AND TRYING NEW THINGS. KANYE DID MANAGE TO TURN KIM INTO AN ICON KANYE IS ALSO THE FIRST TO STATE OUT LOUD THAT KIM WAS AN ICON, THE MARILYN MONROE OF OUR TIMES, THE MOST GORGEOUS, CLASSY AND STYLISH WOMAN IN THE WORLD. CLEARLY, SINCE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN HE LOVED, HE GETS A PASS, BUT THE WORLD KNOWS THAT KIM IS NEITHER FASHIONABLE NOR STYLISH. SHE IS SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT: SHE IS POPULAR, AND IN TODAYS WORLD, POPULARITY MEANS EVERYTHING.

IN 2014, THE COMPETITIVE VIDEO GAMING INDUSTRY SCORED MORE THAN $110 MILLION IN CORPORATE SPONSORSHIPS, WHILE HOLLYWOOD LARGELY WATCHED FROM THE SIDELINE. THAT COULD ALL CHANGE, THANKS TO A FLURRY OF DEALMAKING IN THE FAST-GROWING FIELD OF E-SPORTS. WME-IMG IS LEADING THE WAVE OF ACTIVITY WITH ITS SEPT. 23 REVEAL THAT IT IS PARTNERING WITH TBS TO LAUNCH AN E-SPORTS LEAGUE NEXT YEAR. THE NEWS COMES NINE MONTHS AFTER THE AGENCY ACQUIRED GLOBAL ESPORTS MANAGEMENT, ADDING PROFESSIONAL GAMERS TO ITS ROSTER OF STARS AND TRADITIONAL ATHLETES. READ MORE: IT ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT TELEVISION HAS EYED THE SPACE: MTV AIRED THE WORLD SERIES OF GAMING IN 2005, USA RAN A SERIES OF HALO 2 MATCHUPS IN '06, AND DIRECTV CO-FOUNDED AN E-SPORTS LEAGUE IN '07. BUT THOSE ATTEMPTS HAD A HARD TIME FINDING AN AUDI??ENCE. "THE FAN BASE WAS NOT READY," SAYS WME'S E-SPORTS HEAD TOBIAS SHERMAN. "YOU DIDN'T HAVE KIDS COMING HOME FROM SCHOOL AND GOING STRAIGHT TO YOUTUBE AND TWITCH." THAT'S CHANGED WITH THE RISE OF CONNECTED DEVICES AND SERVICES THAT LET GAMERS BROADCAST THEIR PLAY. LAST YEAR, AMAZON PAID NEARLY $1 BILLION FOR LIVE-STREAMING PLATFORM TWITCH, SETTING OFF A NUMBER OF E-SPORTS INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING MOBILE STREAMING APP MOBCRUSH, WHICH CAA VENTURES AND LIONSGATE BACKED THIS SPRING. RESEARCH FIRM NEWZOO ESTIMATES THAT THE E-SPORTS AUDIENCE HAS GROWN TO 32 MILLION IN THE U.S. AND WILL HIT 50 MILLION BY 2017. WITH THOSE EYEBALLS HAVE COME SPONSORSHIP DEALS, TICKET SALES AND ANCILLARY INCOME FOR THE COMPANIES AND TEAMS THAT OPERATE ON THE E-SPORTS STAGE.

560	BY MARK R. DAY WHEN DR. DONNA SCHINDLER WAS A SENIOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IN 1979, SHE DID AN EXTERNSHIP AT THE LAGUNA PUEBLO NEAR ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO. THATS WHERE SHE SAID SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH WORKING WITH NATIVE PEOPLE. AFTER DOING HER PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY IN THE BAY AREA AND THEN WORKING FOR TEN YEARS, SHE TRAVELED TO NEW ZEALAND WHERE SHE JOINED A MAORI MENTAL HEALTH TEAM. IN 1997 SHE MOVED TO ARIZONA AND WORKED AS A PSYCHIATRIST ON THE NAVAJO NATION. IN 2000, SHE RELOCATED TO AUBURN, CA. SHE HAS WORKED WITH A NATIVE AMERICAN CLINIC FOR THE LAST 14 YEARS AND HAS DONE TELEPSYCHIATRY FOR THE NAVAJO NATION SINCE 2011. SHE SAID THAT UNTIL THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS, MANY NATIVE PEOPLES WERE NOT AWARE OF HISTORICAL TRAUMA AND HOW TO DEAL WITH IT. AND CURRENTLY ALMOST NO ONE IN THE WIDER COMMUNITY IS FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM. THE CONCEPT OF HISTORIC TRAUMA WAS INITIALLY DEVELOPED IN THE 1980S BY FIRST NATIONS AND ABORIGINAL PEOPLES IN CANADA TO EXPLAIN THE SEEMING UNENDING CYCLE OF TRAUMA AND DESPAIR IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ESSENTIALLY, THE DEVASTATING TRAUMA OF GENOCIDE, LOSS OF CULTURE, AND FORCIBLE REMOVAL FROM FAMILY AND COMMUNITIES ARE ALL UNRESOLVED AND BECOME A SORT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL BAGGAGE CONTINUOUSLY BEING ACTED OUT AND RECREATED IN CONTEMPORARY INDIGENOUS. MARK DAY, A FORMER FRANCISCAN FRIAR, REACHED HER BY PHONE RECENTLY AT HER HOME IN AUBURN. HE ASKED HER ABOUT HER WORK WITH HISTORICAL TRAUMA AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE CURRENT POLEMIC ABOUT THE CANONIZATION OF FRAY JUNIPERO SERRA. DAY : LATELY YOU HAVE JOINED OTHER ACTIVISTS IN OPPOSING THE CANONIZATION OF FRAY JUNIPERO SERRA. HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO YOUR WORK AS A PSYCHIATRIST? DR. DONNA SCHINDLER, M.D. SCHINDLER : HISTORICAL TRAUMA IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM WITHIN CALIFORNIA TRIBES, AND IN OTHER TRIBES IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE BEEN COLONIZED. IN MY WORK I TRY TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THE TRAUMAS OF THE PAST STILL AFFECT THEM, CAUSING PRESENT DAY PROBLEMS. AFTER GETTING TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM, WE BEGIN THE HEALING PROCESS. THIS INVOLVES LOOKING AT THE HISTORY OF YOUR TRIBE AND SHARING STORIES OF THE PAST AND ALSO STORIES OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY. DAY : CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES OF YOUR WORK WITH HISTORICAL TRAUMA? SCHINDLER : LAST YEAR I DEALT WITH THE CASE OF JAMIE, A NAVAJO TEENAGER WHO WAS A SENIOR AT MONUMENT VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL IN ARIZONA. JAMIE WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED BY A MAN FOR WHOSE FAMILY SHE HAD BABYSAT. MEANWHILE, IN AN ADJOINING COMMUNITY OF CHINLE, FIVE TEEN GIRLS AND FIVE OTHER YOUNG ADULTS UNDER THE AGE OF 30 COMMITTED SUICIDE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. AFTER JAMIES DEATH, HER MOTHER LISA AND I BEGAN TALKING AND WE DECIDED TO BEGIN THE SACRED DREAM PROJECT, DEDICATED TO HEAL THE SOUL WOUND AND BRING THE COMMUNITY BACK TO HARMONY. THE NAVAJO WORD HOZHONAHASLII ENCOMPASSES OUR VISION AND IT MEANS EVERYTHING WILL RETURN TO HARMONY. IT WAS HEARTENING TO SEE THAT HEALING WAS HAPPENING AT THE FIRST MEETING OF THE SACRED DREAM PROJECT. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE PROJECT WILL CONTINUE FOR MANY YEARS. DAY : CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE EFFECTS OF HISTORICAL TRAUMA? SCHINDLER : AMONG NATIVE AMERICANS THERE ARE EPIDEMIC RATES OF SUICIDE, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, DEPRESSION AND ILLNESSES SUCH AS DIABETES, WHICH ARE THE RESULTS OF HISTORICAL TRAUMA. THE COMMUNITY I KNOW BEST ON THE NAVAJO NATION, EXPERIENCED SIX HOMICIDES THIS YEAR. MANY OF THE HOMICIDES ARE RELATED TO USE OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS, WHICH ARE OFTEN A FORM OF SELF-MEDICATION. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN BE SEEN AS LATERAL OPPRESSION, WHICH MEANS THAT WHEN A POPULATION HAS BEEN OPPRESSED, OFTENTIMES THEY END UP TREATING OTHERS IN THE SAME WAY. THATS WHY ITS SO DEVASTATING THAT POPE FRANCIS IS PUSHING THE SERRA CANONIZATION. FOR THE MOST PART, CALIFORNIA INDIANS HAVE NEVER HEALED FROM THE TREATMENT THEIR ANCESTORS ENDURED IN THE MISSIONS, AND MAKING SERRA A SAINT IS GOING TO MAKE IT EVEN HARDER FOR HEALING TO OCCUR. THAT IS BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR HEALING TO OCCUR, THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD. IF SERRA IS A SAINT, THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THE MISSIONS WILL BE BURIED. A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW, PEOPLE WILL THINK THAT SINCE SERRA IS A SAINT, HE MUST HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING WITH THE INDIANS. ON THE OTHER HAND, SURPRISINGLY, THERE IS A LOT OF HEALING GOING ON RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSES TO THE CANONIZATION: NATIVE PEOPLE ARE GATHERING TO TELL THEIR STORIES AND PRAY AT THE MISSIONS. MANY PEOPLE HAVE DEDICATED HUNDREDS OF HOURS WRITING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MISSIONS, SHEPHERDING THE MOVEON.ORG PETITION THAT ASKS TO ABANDON THE CANONIZATION OF SERRA, EXAMINING DOCUMENTS SUCH AS THE PAPAL BULLS, AND CONNECTING WITH OTHERS WHO WANT THE TRUTH TO BE TOLD. THE SOUL WOUND, AS THE NATIVES CALL IT, IS BEGINNING TO HEAL BECAUSE OF THESE ACTIVITIES. DAY : WHAT HAS TO BE DONE TO BRING ABOUT THE HEALING? SCHINDLER : TO HEAL THE HISTORICAL TRAUMA OR SOUL WOUND YOU HAVE TO LOOK INSIDE YOURSELF AND EMBRACE YOUR PAIN AND SUFFERING, INSTEAD OF SELF-MEDICATING WITH ALCOHOL AND DRUGS. ACCORDING TO ANAM THUBTEN, A BUDDHIST MONK, WE OFTEN FIND A DARK CEMETERY INSIDE, FILLED WITH THINGS LIKE SHAME, GUILT, FEAR, AND ANGER. I SEE NATIVE PEOPLE LOOKING AT THE PAST, SEEING HOW IT AFFECTED THEMWHICH IS PART OF EMBRACING THEIR PAIN AND SUFFERING. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS DENYING ITS DARK SIDE. THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTING THE REALITY OF WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. IF THEY ACKNOWLEDGED IT, APOLOGIZED TO THE NATIVE PEOPLE AND TRIED TO WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE REPARATIONS, IT WOULD MAKE THE HEALING MUCH EASIER, BOTH FOR THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PERSECUTED IN THE MISSIONS, AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS WELL. DAY : YOU MET RECENTLY IN SACRAMENTO WITH A TRIBAL LEADER, TWO CALIFORNIA BISHOPS, AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FRANCISCAN ORDER TO DISCUSS THE SERRA CANONIZATION. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT MEETING? SCHINDLER : VALENTIN LOPEZ, CHAIRMAN OF THE AMAH MUTSUN TRIBAL BAND AND I MET WITH BISHOP WILLIAM CLARK OF LOS ANGELES AND FATHER KEN LAVERONE, WHO IS THE FRANCISCAN SPOKESMAN FOR THE SERRA CANONIZATION, AND LATER WITH BISHOP FRANCIS QUINN. AT FIRST I THOUGHT CLARK AND LAVERONE WANTED TO HELP US, TO LISTEN TO OUR POINT OF VIEW. WE BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT OF ELIAS CASTILLOS NEW BOOK, CROSS OF THORNS, WHICH DETAILS THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED AGAINST THE NATIVE CALIFORNIANS AT THE MISSIONS. CLARK AND LAVERONE DISMISSED IT, SINCE CASTILLO, THEY SAID, WAS A JOURNALIST, NOT AN HISTORIAN. INSTEAD THEY SUPPORTED ANOTHER BOOK JUNIPERO SERRA: CALIFORNIA, INDIANS, AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF A MISSIONARY BY ROSEMARY BEEBE AND ROBERT SENKEWICS, PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THE FRANCISCAN ACADEMY OF AMERICAN HISTORY. I ASKED TO SEE THIS BOOK AND TRIED TO LOOK UP THE FAMOUS QUOTE BY FRAY MARIANO PAYERAS, THE LAST PADRE PRESIDENTE OF THE MISSIONS. PAYERAS WROTE TO HIS SUPERIORS, ALL WE HAVE DONE TO THE INDIANS IS CONSECRATE THEM, BAPTIZE THEM, AND BURY THEM. THAT QUOTE WAS ELIMINATED FROM THIS BOOK. WE ALSO BROUGHT UP RUPERT COSTOS BOOK, THE MISSIONS OF CALIFORNIA: A LEGACY OF GENOCIDE. COSTO WROTE THAT IN THE 1980S SOME PRIESTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THREATENED TO SANCTION THEIR PARISHIONERS IF THEY SHARED THEIR ANCESTORS STORIES OF THE MISSIONS WITH COSTO. FR. LAVERONE ARGUED THAT THE PRIESTS WERE ACTING ON THEIR OWN, NOT DOING WHAT THE VATICAN HAD TOLD THEM TO DO. I READ OTHER PASSAGES FROM COSTOS BOOK ABOUT HISTORICAL MEMORIES OF NATIVE CALIFORNIANS. FR. LAVERONE SAID THAT YOU CANT REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO SUCH STORIES THAT ARE PASSED DOWN USING THE ORAL TRADITION. FROM THAT POINT EVERYTHING WENT DOWNHILL. WE BELIEVE THERE CAN BE NO HEALING, NO RECONCILIATION WITH THAT KIND OF AN ATTITUDE. MARK R. DAY IS A FORMER FRANCISCAN FRIAR, A JOURNALIST, AND EMMY AWARD WINNING FILMMAKER. HE LIVES IN VISTA, CA.

PHYSICIANS ARE VENTING THEIR ANGER ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ON TWITTER , HARDLINERS ARE THREATENING JOB ACTION SUCH AS A WORK-TO-RULE CAMPAIGN, HOUR CUTBACKS AND CANCELLATION OF FLU-SHOT CLINICS. TOTH SAID THE OMA, WHICH REPRESENTS 28,000 MEMBERS, WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION. HEALTH MINISTER ERIC HOSKINS SAID HE WANTS TO REASSURE ONTARIANS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERVICE CUTS. "MY CONCERN IS THAT A PERCEPTION IS BEING PROPAGATED THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE CHALLENGING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE FACTS SIMPLY DON'T BEAR THIS OUT," HE SAID.  HUNDREDS OF OTHER REFUGEES SAY THEY WILL NOW WALK FROM BUDAPEST TO VIENNA, BECAUSE THEY ARE SICK OF WAITING.  IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OF WASTE GENERATED IN HEALTH CARE FACILITIES CAUSES A DIRECT HEALTH IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY, THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND ON THE ENVIRONMENT. ONTARIO DOCTORS ARE AMONG THE BEST PAID IN CANADA WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF ABOUT $380,000, AN AMOUNT THAT HAS GROWN BY 60 PER CENT OVER THAT LAST DECADE, HOSKINS SAID. FROM THAT, PHYSICIANS PAY OVERHEAD COSTS, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE WAGES AND OFFICE RENT, AN AMOUNT WIDELY QUOTED AS ABOUT 30 PER CENT. HOSKINS SAID PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED OVER WHAT DISPUTE OVER REMUNERATION: "I HAVE RECEIVED ASSURANCE PRESIDENT OF THE OMA THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE ACTION THAT WILL THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY PROVIDE OR PATIENT SAFETY. I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD." THE RIFT DATES BACK TO A PAYMENT SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT UNILATERALLY IMPOSED LAST AFTER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ENDED IN AN IMPASSE. IT INCLUDED A 5.65 PER CENT FEE CUT AND A CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IF DOCTORS' OHIP BILLINGS WERE TAKING DOCTORS OVER THEIR $11.6-ALLOTMENT. THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENT MODEL ALLOWS DOCTORS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPENSATION. IF THEY SEE MORE PATIENTS AND PERFORM MORE PROCEDURES, THEY CAN BILL THE PUBLIC INSURANCE PLAN FOR MORE MONEY. THE PAYMENT SCHEME ALSO INCLUDES INCREASES OF 1.25 PER CENT IN THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES BUDGET FOR EACH THE NEXT TWO THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE ANNUAL INCREASES ARE INTENDED TO MEET A RISE IN DEMAND FROM A GROWING AND AGING POPULATION AND THE ADDITION OF 700 NEW DOCTORS. BUT OMA CONTENDS INCREASES OF 2.7 PER CENT ARE NEEDED IN OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND GROWTH.  WE JUST SHARED THE FIRST FIG FROM THE GARDEN...I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE ABLE TO SAY THAT IN ENGLAND. THE OMA IS LOBBYING MPPS, TOWN HALL MEETINGS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE PROVINCE AND STAGING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH MEMBERS NEXT WEEK. TOTH ARGUED THERE IS A "POWER IMBALANCE" WITH GOVERNMENT AND CALLED FOR A NEUTRAL THIRD-PARTY TO WEIGH IN WITH A BINDING DECISION: "WE ARE LOOKING TO RESOLVE THIS ... WE THINK THE TO DO THIS IS MEDIATION-ARBITRATION."

565	ARSENALS CONTINUED ROBUST FINANCIAL FIGURES MUST BE BACKED UP BY RESULTS ON THE PITCH, ACCORDING TO THE CHAIR OF THE ARSENAL INDEPENDENT SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATION. THE GUNNERS PARENT COMPANY ANNOUNCED A PROFIT OF 24.7 MILLION AND A CASH RESERVE OF 193.1 MILLION IN THE SAME WEEK AS ARSENE WENGERS SIDE SLUMPED TO A DISAPPOINTING 2-1 DEFEAT IN THEIR OPENING CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TIE AWAY TO DINAMO ZAGREB. THE RESULTS, COVERING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2015, PUT THE GROUPS TOTAL TURNOVER AT 344.5 MILLION, UP FROM 301.9 MILLION IN 2014. SEE MORE: WENGER FOCUSING ON SOCCER, CHELSEA INSTEAD OF MOURINHO . ARSENAL INVESTED HEAVILY IN ARSENE WENGERS FA CUP-WINNING SQUAD OVER THE PERIOD, WITH AN OUTLAY OF AROUND 114 MILLION AND INCREASED WAGES NOW UP TO JUST OVER 192 MILLION. HOWEVER, THE GUNNERS ADDED ONLY GOALKEEPER PETR CECH, SIGNED FROM CHELSEA, TO THE SQUAD DURING THE 2015 SUMMER TRANSFER WINDOW, AND THEY DID NOT BRING IN ANOTHER STRIKER AHEAD OF THE SEPTEMBER DEADLINE DESPITE A LENGTHY INJURY TO DANNY WELBECK . ALTHOUGH ARSENALS BUMPER CASH RESERVES, WHICH EXCLUDE A 35 MILLION PAYMENT ON THE LONG-TERM EMIRATES STADIUM FINANCING, ARE INTENDED TO COVER COSTS FOR A FULL SEASON, AND ARE NOT SOLELY DESIGNATED FOR PLAYER TRANSFERS, THERE ARE GROWING CALLS FOR SOME OF THE SURPLUS FUNDS TO BE USED ON RECRUITMENT. SEE MORE: PREMIER LEAGUE CLUBS STILL FAILING EUROPES TACTICS TESTS . AISA CHAIR LOIS LANGTON TOLD PRESS ASSOCIATION SPORT: ARSENALS FINANCIAL RESULTS AT LEAST SHOW THAT THE CLUB HAS PRODUCED ONE GOOD PERFORMANCE SO FAR THIS WEEK. THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE CLUB IS WELL-RUN. WHAT SUPPORTERS WANT TO SEE, HOWEVER, IS THAT THE FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE MATCHED BY RESULTS ON THE PITCH AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE TIMING FOR ARSENAL THAT THE RESULTS HAVE FOLLOWED HOT ON THE HEELS OF A WOEFUL PERFORMANCE IN EUROPE. SPENDING MONEY IN THE TRANSFER WINDOW ISNT ALWAYS THE ANSWER; ONE QUALITY SIGNING IS OFTEN BETTER THAN SEVERAL AVERAGE SIGNINGS. HOWEVER, IN A WEEK WHERE MANY SUPPORTERS HAVE SPENT CONSIDERABLE MONEY FOLLOWING THE TEAM INTO EUROPE ONLY TO SEE A BELOW-PAR PERFORMANCE, THE FINANCIAL FIGURES WILL ONLY ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE FOR THOSE CALLING FOR FURTHER SQUAD INVESTMENT.

567	MINA AT LEAST 453 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND HUNDREDS MORE INJURED IN A STAMPEDE THURSDAY ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MECCA, THE DEADLIEST TRAGEDY TO STRIKE THE ANNUAL HAJJ PILGRIMAGE IN MORE THAN TWO DECADES. IT WAS THE SECOND MAJOR DISASTER DURING THIS YEAR'S HAJJ SEASON, RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ADEQUACY OF MEASURES PUT IN PLACE BY SAUDI AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE ROUGHLY 2 MILLION MUSLIMS TAKING PART. A CRANE COLLAPSE IN MECCA NEARLY TWO WEEKS EARLIER LEFT MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE DEAD. THURSDAY'S CRUSH HAPPENED IN MINA, A LARGE VALLEY ABOUT FIVE KILOMETERS (THREE MILES) FROM THE HOLY CITY OF MECCA THAT HAS BEEN THE SITE OF HAJJ STAMPEDES IN YEARS PAST. MINA IS WHERE PILGRIMS CARRY OUT A SYMBOLIC STONING OF THE DEVIL BY THROWING PEBBLES AGAINST THREE STONE COLUMNS. IT ALSO HOUSES MORE THAN 160,000 TENTS WHERE PILGRIMS SPEND THE NIGHT DURING THE PILGRIMAGE. THE STAMPEDE OCCURRED IN A MORNING SURGE OF PILGRIMS AT THE INTERSECTION OF STREETS 204 AND 223 AS THE FAITHFUL WERE MAKING THEIR WAY TOWARD A LARGE STRUCTURE OVERLOOKING THE COLUMNS, ACCORDING TO THE SAUDI CIVIL DEFENSE DIRECTORATE. THE MULTI-STORY STRUCTURE, KNOWN AS JAMARAT BRIDGE, IS DESIGNED TO EASE THE PRESSURE OF THE CROWDS AND PREVENT PILGRIMS FROM BEING TRAMPLED. THE CIVIL DEFENSE DIRECTORATE, WHICH PROVIDED THE DEATH TOLL, SAID AT LEAST 719 OTHER PILGRIMS WERE INJURED IN THE STAMPEDE. AMBULANCE SIRENS BLARED AS RESCUE CREWS RUSHED THE INJURED TO NEARBY HOSPITALS. MORE THAN 220 RESCUE VEHICLES AND SOME 4,000 MEMBERS OF THE EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE DEPLOYED SOON AFTER THE STAMPEDE TO TRY TO EASE THE CONGESTION AND PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE EXIT ROUTES, ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTORATE. AMATEUR VIDEO SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA SHOWED A HORRIFIC SCENE, WITH SCORES OF BODIES THE MEN DRESSED IN THE SIMPLE TERRY CLOTH GARMENTS WORN DURING HAJJ LYING AMID CRUSHED WHEELCHAIRS AND WATER BOTTLES ALONG A SUNBAKED STREET. SURVIVORS ASSESSED THE SCENE FROM THE TOP OF ROADSIDE STALLS NEAR WHITE TENTS AS RESCUE WORKERS IN ORANGE AND YELLOW VESTS COMBED THE AREA. PHOTOS RELEASED BY THE DIRECTORATE ON ITS OFFICIAL TWITTER ACCOUNT SHOWED RESCUE WORKERS HELPING THE WOUNDED ONTO STRETCHERS AND LOADING THEM ONTO AMBULANCES NEAR SOME OF THE TENTS. SOME 2 MILLION PEOPLE ARE TAKING PART IN THIS YEAR'S HAJJ PILGRIMAGE, WHICH IS AN OBLIGATION OF EVERY ABLE-BODIED MUSLIM. THE PILGRIMAGE BEGAN IN EARNEST TUESDAY. SAUDI AUTHORITIES TAKE EXTENSIVE PRECAUTIONS TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE HAJJ AND THE SAFETY OF PILGRIMS. THERE ARE ABOUT 100,000 SECURITY FORCES DEPLOYED THIS YEAR TO OVERSEE CROWD MANAGEMENT AND ENSURE PILGRIMS' SAFETY DURING THE FIVE-DAY PILGRIMAGE. AT MINA SPECIFICALLY, AUTHORITIES HAVE PUT MEASURES IN PLACE OVER THE YEARS TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE THE PRESSURE POSED BY MASSES OF PILGRIMS CONVERGING ON THE SITE OF THE STONING RITUAL. OFFICIALS USE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CONVERGING ON THE SITE, AND THE JAMARAT BRIDGE HAS MULTIPLE EXITS TO FACILITATE THE FLOW OF PEOPLE. BUT TRAGEDIES ARE NOT UNCOMMON. THE DEATH TOLL FROM THURSDAY'S STAMPEDE FAR EXCEEDED THAT OF A SIMILAR INCIDENT IN 2006, NEAR THE SITE OF THE LATEST INCIDENT, WHEN MORE THAN 360 PILGRIMS WERE KILLED IN A STAMPEDE. ANOTHER STAMPEDE AT MINA IN 2004 LEFT 244 PILGRIMS DEAD AND HUNDREDS INJURED. THE DEADLIEST HAJJ-RELATED TRAGEDY HAPPENED IN 1990, WHEN AT LEAST 1,426 PILGRIMS PERISHED IN A STAMPEDE IN AN OVERCROWDED PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL LEADING TO HOLY SITES IN MECCA. THURSDAY'S STAMPEDE HAPPENED LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AFTER A GIANT CONSTRUCTION CRANE CAME CRASHING DOWN ON THE GRAND MOSQUE IN MECCA, THE FOCAL POINT OF THE HAJJ. THAT ACCIDENT, ON SEPT. 11, KILLED AT LEAST 111 PEOPLE AND INJURED MORE THAN 390. AUTHORITIES BLAMED THE CRANE COLLAPSE ON HIGH WINDS DURING AN UNUSUALLY POWERFUL STORM, AND FAULTED THE CONSTRUCTION GIANT SAUDI BINLADIN GROUP, WHICH OVERSEES CONSTRUCTION AT THE MOSQUE, FOR NOT FOLLOWING OPERATING PROCEDURES.

569	ITS TIME FOR THE LATEST INSTALMENT OF DEALS ON WHEELS, WHICH LOOKS AT FOUR FACTORY-BACKED SPECIAL OFFERS FOR ALL YOU WEEKEND SHOPPERS. THIS ISNT A PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN, JUST US TRYING TO OFFER YOU SOME INTERESTING SUGGESTIONS IF YOURE IN THE MARKET FOR SOME NEW WHEELS. THIS WEEKS VERSION HAS A THEME. MOST OF THECARS FEATURED THIS WEEK ARE SOMEWHAT UNLOVED IN THE SALES RACE, BUT EACH HAVE GOOD OWNERSHIP CREDENTIALS, EVEN IF NONE ARE CRITICAL CLASS-LEADERS. ALL BAR ONE, FURTHERMORE, ARE SUVS, AND THE OTHER IS A NOVEL ALTERNATIVE TO WHAT IS BECOMING THE DE RIGEUR FORM OF FAMILY TRANSPORT. PEUGEOT 2008 WE LIKE THE PEUGEOT 2008. ITS PERFORMED WELL IN MULTIPLE SMALL CROSSOVER COMPARISON TESTS OVER THE YEARS, WHICH YOU CAN READ ABOUT HERE. BUT ITS NEVER REALLY CUT THROUGH WITH BUYERS. TO STIMULATE INTEREST, PEUGEOT IS PROMOTING A CAMPAIGN DEAL THAT OFFERS A ZERO PER CENT COMPARISON RATE, AND EXTENDS THE WARRANTY TO FIVE-YEARS/100,000KM " THERES SOME PEACE OF MIND IN THAT. THE FINE PRINT SAYS THE FINANCE, OFFERS BY ALPHERA FINANCIAL SERVICES, INCLUDES A MAXIMUM FINANCE TERM OF 36 MONTHS WITH NO RESIDUAL (BALLOON) PAYMENT. THIS OFFER APPLIES TO PETROL AND DIESEL, MANUAL AND AUTO VARIANTS OF EVERY STRIPE. ALL VARIANTS GET STANDARD FEATURES SUCH AS A SEVEN-INCH TOUCHSCREEN, REVERSE-VIEW CAMERA AND PARKING SENSORS. READ MORE INFO ON THE MANUFACTURER SPECIAL PAGE HERE. SUZUKI S-CROSS AS YOU CAN READ IN OUR VARIOUS REVIEWS HERE, THE SUZUKI S-CROSS IS A DECENT, SAFE AND RESPECTABLE LITTLE CROSSOVER THAT " WHILE NO EXCITEMENT MACHINE " EQUALLY WONT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE. ITS ALSO A FEATHERWEIGHT THAT HANDLES WITH SOME ALACRITY, AND HAS GOOD REAR SEAT SPACE. NOT SPECTACULAR, THEN. BUT SUZUKI IS CURRENTLY DOING THE BASE GL (ADMITTEDLY WITH A FIVE-SPEED MANUAL GEARBOX, RATHER THAN THE MORE SOUGHT-AFTER CVT AUTO) FOR $21,990 DRIVE-AWAY, THOUSANDS LESS THAN YOUD PAY BASED ON RRP. THIS IS ALSO ABOUT WHAT YOUD PAY FOR A COROLLA OR GOLF, AND NEITHER OF THEM OFFER THE S-CROSS 480-LITRE CARGO SPACE AND HIGHER DRIVING POSITION. ALL S-CROSS MODELS GET SEVEN AIRBAGS (FIVE-STAR ANCAP), ALLOY WHEELS AND BLUETOOTH. KEEP IN MIND THE S-CROSS WILL BE JOINED WITHIN WEEKS BY ITS FUNKIER VITARA COUSIN, TOO. READ MORE INFO ON THE MANUFACTURER SPECIAL PAGE HERE. MITSUBISHI CHALLENGER WE ARENT GOING TO PULL THE WOOL OVER YOUR EYES. THE MITSUBISHI CHALLENGER IS ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES AND GETTING TIRED, AS YOU CAN READ ABOUT IN OUR LATEST REVIEW HERE. WHAT IT IS, THOUGH, IS ABSOLUTELY BULLETPROOF, RUGGED TRANSPORT. A GOOD TOW VEHICLE OR WEEKEND OFF-ROADER IF REFINEMENT ISNT YOUR BAG.  REPUBLICANS WILL STILL LIKELY FIGHT TO STRIP FUNDING FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD, AND THEY MIGHT ALSO DEMAND LEADERS TRY TO EXTRACT CONCESSIONS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AS A CONDITION OF RAISING THE DEBT LIMIT, WHICH MUST BE DEALT WITH SOON.  WE HAVE TO BELIEVE AND TRUST IN THE WORK WE'VE PUT IN TO GET TO THIS POINT. WITH THE NEW ONE DUE HERE IN EARLY 2016 " IF ITS ANYTHING LIKE THE NEW TRITON, ITLL BE MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN BEFORE " THE OUTGOING CAR IS ON RUNOUT. ERGO, ITS CHEAP. VERY CHEAP. AND IN THAT CONTEXT IT MAKES SENSE.  $33,990 DRIVE-AWAY FOR A 4WD DIESEL MANUAL. THE THING HAS AN RRP OF $42,990 BEFORE ON-ROADS, SO IT DOESNT TAKE A GENIUS TO SEE YOURE SAVING WAY OVER $10,000 FROM LIST HERE. YOU GET A 131KW/400NM 2.5-LITRE DIESEL, FIVE-SPEED MANUAL GEARBOX, A 3000KG BRAKED TOWING CAPACITY, SIX AIRBAGS, 16-INCH ALLOYS, A LEATHER STEERING WHEEL, CRUISE CONTROL, BLUETOOTH/USB/AUX, SIDE STEPS AND ROOF RAILS. READ MORE INFO ON THE MANUFACTURER SPECIAL PAGE HERE. NISSAN PATHFINDER IF YOURE LUGGING AROUND A BUNCH OF KIDS AND WANT A FAMILY SUV, ODDS ARE YOUD BE LOOKING AT THE TOP-SELLING TOYOTA KLUGER.  EMP.A HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL OTHER REPORTS.  OGUZHAN OZYAKUP (TURKEY) RIGHT FOOTED SHOT FROM THE CENTRE OF THE BOX TO THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER. IF WERE HONEST, THE NISSAN PATHFINDER ST ISNT AS GOOD (READ OUR COMPARISON TEST HERE) BUT AT THIS SPECIAL NISSAN CAMPAIGN PRICE OF $39,990 DRIVE-AWAY (NISSAN IS WAIVING ON-ROAD CHARGES AND TAXES), ITS ALSO ABOUT $6000 CHEAPER THAN SAID TOYOTA. AND, AS YOU CAN READ ABOUT IN OUR REVIEWS HERE, ITS A SIZEABLE CROSSOVER SUV WITH THREE GENUINE ROWS OF SEATS.

WE ARE NOW ABLE TO MONITOR ANY CARGO FROM INBOUND ALL THE WAY TO THE OUTBOUND AND IT'S LOADING ON THE DEPARTING TRUCK WITH 100% COVERAGE OF ALL HANDLING AREAS", SAID STEVEN VOSSENAAR, QUALITY & RISK MANAGER, RABEN NETHERLANDS B.V. RENAULT MEGANE WAGON HANG ON " THE RENAULT MEGANE WAGON ISNT A CROSSOVER SUV! BUT WHAT IF YOU FANCY THE LOAD-BEARING ABILITIES BUT WANT SOMETHING MORE NICHE, MORE EUROPEAN, AND MORE DYNAMIC? THE CLASS-LEADER IS THE UBIQUITOUS VOLKSWAGEN GOLF WITH THE PEUGEOT 308 A CLOSE SECOND, BUT THATS NOT THE IMPUGN TO MEGANE LOAD-LUGGER.

571	BY SARAH KENT AND GEORGI KANTCHEV LONDON--EUROPE'S COMMODITIES TRADERS ARE WARNING THAT NEW REGULATIONS SET TO BE RELEASED WITHIN DAYS COULD ROIL MARKETS AND PUSH UP COSTS FOR A RANGE OF ESSENTIALS FROM CRUDE OIL TO CHOCOLATE. A FINAL DRAFT OF EXPANDED RULES GOVERNING THE EUROPEAN UNION'S OVERSIGHT OF FINANCIAL MARKETS IS EXPECTED TO EXTEND ITS AUTHORITY OVER FIRMS THAT FOCUS ON TRADING IN OIL, FARM PRODUCTS, INDUSTRIAL METALS LIKE COPPER AND A HOST OF OTHER COMMODITIES. IT WOULD ADD A NEW LAYER OF SCRUTINY FOR AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY OPERATED WITH LIMITED OVERSIGHT. THESE COMPANIES--LIKE BP PLC, GLENCORE PLC AND VITOL GROUP--BUY AND SELL HUGE VOLUMES OF OIL AND INDUSTRIAL METALS ON A DAILY BASIS, HEDGING THEIR STOCKS OF RAW MATERIALS WITH SIZABLE POSITIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY JUST HOW BIG THEY ARE, VITOL STUNNED MARKET WATCHERS IN 2008 WHEN REGULATORS DISCOVERED THAT AN INTERNAL HEDGE FUND REPRESENTED 11% OF OUTSTANDING OIL TRADES ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE. THE EU'S REGULATIONS ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF A REPEAT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND PREVENT MARKET ABUSE SUCH AS THE $2.6 BILLION LOSS IN THE COPPER MARKET ATTRIBUTED TO A TRADER AT JAPAN'S SUMITOMO IN THE 1990S. THE EU'S CURRENT RULES MOSTLY APPLY TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE BANKS AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. RIGHT NOW, BIG TRADERS LIKE GLENCORE, VITOL AND MERCURIA GROUP DON'T HAVE THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS BANKS TO SET ASIDE MONEY TO BACKSTOP THEIR TRADING AND LIMIT THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTS THEY TRADE IN A GIVEN TIME. THE NEW RULES ARE EXPECTED TO REQUIRE MORE OF THE TRADERS, THOUGH HOW MUCH REMAINS UNCLEAR. BIG COMMODITIES PLAYERS FROM ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC TO MARS CHOCOLATE TO TRAFIGURA BEHEER BV HAVE OBJECTED TO THE IDEA OF BEING TREATED ESSENTIALLY LIKE BANKS, LOBBYING BRUSSELS TO EXEMPT THEM FROM SOME OF THE RULES. THEY SAY THEY SHOULDN'T BE REGULATED AS CLOSELY BECAUSE A LARGE PART OF THEIR BUSINESS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS IS INTENDED TO LOWER THEIR RISK WHEN TRADING RAW MATERIALS. NEW RULES, THEY ARGUE, WOULD MAKE IT HARDER TO TRADE AND COULD CAUSE SOME TO LEAVE THE MARKET, MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR AIRLINES, UTILITIES AND OTHERS TO MANAGE THEIR EXPOSURE TO COMMODITIES PRICES--COSTS THAT ULTIMATELY WOULD BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS. "WE ARE UTTERLY IN FAVOR OF REGULATION, BUT WE DON'T WANT BAD OR OVER-REGULATED MARKETS THAT MAKE LIQUIDITY DRY UP," SAID GRAHAM FRANCIS, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT INTERDEALER BROKER ICAP ENERGY. "IF A BUNCH OF LIQUIDITY LEAVES, THEN WHAT? THINGS WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CONSUMERS...AND YOU'VE PROBABLY NOT IMPROVED MARKET STABILITY OR FUNCTIONALITY." THE EUROPEAN SECURITIES AND MARKETS AUTHORITY IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE TECHNICAL DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE REGULATIONS--KNOWN AS THE MARKETS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIRECTIVE, OR MIFID II--WILL BE APPLIED WITHIN DAYS. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, THE EU'S EXECUTIVE BRANCH, MUST THEN APPROVE OR REJECT THEM. REEMT SEIBEL, SPOKESMAN FOR THE SECURITIES AND MARKETS AUTHORITY, SAID THE AGENCY APPRECIATES THE CONCERNS RAISED BY BUSINESSES AND WOULD CONSIDER THEM. "IT IS NOT THE AIM OF ANY REGULATION TO KILL BUSINESS," HE SAID. TRADERS ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT WILL BE CAPTURED BY THE NEW RULES, THE VOLUMES THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TRADE AND WHETHER THEY WILL LEAVE BIG TRADERS SUBJECT TO HOLDING CAPITAL IN A SIMILAR WAY TO BANKS. "WE ARE NOT A BANK," SAID PATRICK POUYANN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FRENCH OIL GIANT TOTAL SA, WHICH HAS A LARGE TRADING ARM. HE ADDED IN A WEDNESDAY INTERVIEW: "I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED SOME REGULATIONS, BUT UP TO A POINT THAT LEAVES MARKETS TO WORK." SHELL HAS WARNED THAT IT COULD HAVE TO COMMIT UP TO $30 BILLION IN REGULATORY CAPITAL IF THE RULES ARE ENFORCED AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED. THAT COULD PROMPT THE COMPANY TO RESTRUCTURE OR MOVE PART OF ITS TRADING ARM TO A COUNTRY WITH LESS ONEROUS RULES. THE RULES ARE BEING PROPOSED AT A DIFFICULT MOMENT FOR ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TRADERS, GLENCORE. THE COMPANY HAS LOST MORE THAN 60% OF ITS STOCK VALUE THIS YEAR AS INVESTORS WORRY ABOUT ITS DEBT LEVELS AND CREDIT RATINGS AMID A COMMODITY PRICE SLUMP WITH NO END IN SIGHT. GLENCORE AND OTHERS WOULD HAVE AT LEAST 15 MONTHS TO PREPARE AND RESTRUCTURE THEIR BUSINESSES BEFORE THE RULES WENT INTO EFFECT. THE COMPANY REMAINS RELAXED ABOUT THE NEW RULES, ONE PERSON FAMILIAR WITH ITS THINKING SAID. IF NEEDED, IT COULD SIMPLY MOVE ITS TRADING OPERATIONS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. MANY OF WALL STREET'S BIGGEST FIRMS HAVE THEMSELVES DRAMATICALLY SCALED BACK THEIR COMMODITIES TRADING OR EXITED THE BUSINESS ALTOGETHER BECAUSE OF TOUGH REGULATIONS ALREADY IN PLACE. SOME OBSERVERS SAID TRADERS ARE BEING HYPERBOLIC AND THE REGULATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE BIGGEST AMERICAN OIL COMPANIES SUCH AS EXXON MOBIL CORP. AND CHEVRON CORP. HAVEN'T BEEN AS VOCAL IN OPPOSITION TO THE NEW RULES. THEY FOCUS THEIR TRADING AROUND SELLING THE CRUDE THEY PRODUCE. MAJOR EUROPEAN OIL COMPANIES HAVE LARGE TRADING ARMS THAT BUY AND SELL ADDITIONAL VOLUMES THEY DIDN'T PRODUCE. "THIS IS THE MINIMUM SET OF REQUIREMENTS THAT IS INDISPENSABLE," SAID DIEGO VALIANTE, HEAD OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS UNIT AT THE CENTRE FOR EUROPEAN POLICY STUDIES AND AN ADVISER TO ESMA. ACCORDING TO MR. VALIANTE'S CALCULATIONS, THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL EVEN THE LARGEST TRADING HOUSES WOULD NEED TO HOLD WOULD ONLY BE IN THE ORDER OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS--A LARGE, BUT AFFORDABLE FIGURE. "I DISAGREE THAT IT WILL CREATE A BIG MARKET DISRUPTION," HE SAID. THE EU'S LATEST REGULATORY PUSH WAS CONCEIVED IN THE WAKE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, AMID HEIGHTENED CONCERNS OVER SYSTEMIC RISKS IN THE MARKET AND THE ROLE SPECULATORS PLAY IN PUSHING UP PRICES FOR VITAL RAW MATERIALS LIKE OIL AND AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES. THE U.S. IS ALSO IN THE MIDST OF ITS OWN REGULATORY CRACKDOWN, LAUNCHED BY THE 2010 DODD-FRANK LAW, BUT MANY VIEW THE PROPOSED EUROPEAN REGIME AS LIKELY TO BE MORE STRINGENT. IN A SIGN OF THE IMPACT THE RULES COULD HAVE ON FINANCIAL MARKETS, GERMANY, FRANCE AND THE U.K. IN AUGUST EXPRESSED CONCERNS OVER SOME OF THE DETAILS AND CALLED ON REGULATORS TO MODIFY SOME ASPECTS.

572	HALLOWEEN FOR ALL? BY DARIEN ACHS EIGHTH GRADE AS WE CELEBRATE THE MYSTERIOUS AND FUN HOLIDAY OF HALLOWEEN, A QUESTION IS BEING FREQUENTLY ASKED AMONG PARENTS. ARE 7TH AND 8TH GRADERS TOO OLD TO TRICK-OR-TREAT? FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN EIGHTH GRADER, I WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER THAT WITH A NO! I BELIEVE THAT IT IS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS TO TRICK-OR-TREAT; IN FACT ANYBODY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL IS STILL YOUNG ENOUGH TO TRICK-OR-TREAT, IN MY OPINION. THE REASONING BEHIND MY FEELINGS IS THAT FOR ONE, ITS FREE CANDY, ANOTHER THING IS THAT WHILE WE ARE OUT, WE CAN SHOW OFF OUR AWESOME COSTUME THAT TOOK AGES TO MAKE, PREPARE, OR BUY, AND IT GIVES US AN EXCUSE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH OUR FRIENDS, AND TO GET OUTSIDE FOR A BIT. ANOTHER THING TO ADD IS THAT IT GIVES US A CHANCE TO WALK AROUND ERIE AND SEE ALL THE DECORATIONS. EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A NIGHT OF FUN, KEEP YOUR MANNERS AND REMEMBER THAT IT IS THE HOMEOWNERS CHOICE TO GIVE CANDY, SO IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO, THEN GRACIOUSLY THANK THEM AND LEAVE, DO NOT PULL A TRICK INSTEAD OF A TREAT. AS LONG AS OUR MANNERS ARE PRESENT, OUR COSTUMES ARE APPROPRIATE, AND BEHAVIOR IS SUITABLE TO SOCIETIES EXPECTATIONS, TRICK-OR-TREATING IS A FINE ACTIVITY FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS OF ALL AGES. HALLOWEEN IS A FUN HOLIDAY THAT SHOULD BE ENJOYED BY ALL AGES, AND THE AGE LIMIT FOR TRICK-OR-TREATING SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN IN CHARGE, NOT THE EXPECTATIONS PLACED UPON US BY SOCIETY. HAPPY HALLOWEEN! SPRINGFIELD: THE BEST TRIP BY CARISSA JOHNSON EIGHTH GRADE ON OCT. 9, 2014, ERIE MIDDLE SCHOOLS 8TH GRADERS WENT TO SPRINGFIELD FOR A CLASS TRIP. THE FIRST STOP ON OUR STATE CAPITAL TRIP WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLNS HOUSE. THOUGH THE HOME HAD BEEN RESTORED, THE HISTORICAL FURNITURE IS PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME PLACE AS IT WAS WHEN THE LINCOLN'S LIVED THERE. OUR SECOND STOP WAS THE STATE CAPITAL. THE INTERIOR WAS BEAUTIFUL, WHETHER IT WAS THE ENTRANCE, SENATE OR HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ROOM. IT ALL LOOKED QUITE GRAND. IN THE DOME PART OF THE BUILDING IS THE STATE SEAL, MADE FROM STAIN GLASS, AND IN THE MIDDLE WERE LIFE SIZE STATUES OF FAMOUS POLITICAL PEOPLE WHO CAME FROM ILLINOIS. OUR NEXT STOP WAS THE OLD STATE CAPITAL. THOUGH IT WASNT AS FLASHY AS THE NEW CAPITAL IT WAS STILL FILLED WITH TONS OF HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE. WE LEARNED HOW IT WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLNS FUNERAL TRAINS FINAL STOP AND MANY MORE THINGS ABOUT THE BUILDING ITSELF. OUR FINAL STOP WAS THE LINCOLN LIBRARY AND MUSEUM. WHEN WE FIRST WALKED INTO THE MUSEUM PART OF THE BUILDING, ONE SIDE IS A REPLICA OF LINCOLNS CABIN THAT HE GREW UP IN, AND THE WHITE HOUSE. WE WALKED THROUGH THEM BOTH AND CONTINUE ON. IN THE MUSEUM THERE WAS AN ABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION ON LINCOLN AND THE CIVIL WAR. THEN, WHEN WE WALKED THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE WE SAW A SET UP OF LINCOLNS FUNERAL. THE WHOLE PLACE WAS SO UNIQUE TO ALL OF US. SPRINGFIELD WAS A GREAT TRIP. THE ENTIRE CLASS LOVED BEING IN THE CITY WITH SO MUCH HISTORY AND GETTING TO SPEND TIME WITH OUR FRIENDS. THIS IS A FIELD TRIP THAT WILL NOT SOON BE FORGOTTEN AND WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO GO ON. BOY SCOUTS UNDERTAKE NEW MISSION BY BLAKE MISFELDT SEVENTH GRADE ERIE BOY SCOUT TROOP 101 HAS STARTED A FLAG PROJECT IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. THE WOLF PATROL, A PATROL WITH ONLY FOUR SEVENTH GRADERS IN TROOP 101, SAW THERE WAS A NEED FOR NEW FLAGS IN THEIR TOWN, ERIE. THE FLAGS WERE WORN AND TATTERED AND JUST NEEDED TO GO. BUT, BEFORE BEING ABLE TO UNDERTAKE SUCH A HUGE PROJECT, THE PATROL ALSO NEEDED THE HELP OF THEIR LOCAL AMERICAN LEGION. THEY BEGAN BY WRITING A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE FOR THEIR LOCAL NEWSPAPER TO SELL SPONSORSHIPS FOR $200. IF A DONOR CHOSE TO SPONSOR A FLAG THEY COULD HAVE A NAME ENGRAVED ON A PLAQUE, AND THEN PLACED ON THE ERIE TRIANGLE. WE WERE NOT SURE IF WE WOULD DO GOOD ON THE PROJECT OR IF IT WOULD BE A COMPLETE BUST, BUT IN THE END IT TURNED OUT ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE EXPECTED; SO FAR WE HAVE COLLECTED AROUND $2,700, SAID TROOP MEMBER BLAKE MISFELDT. THIS WAS A LOT MORE THAN WHAT WE NEEDED SO A FOURTEENTH FLAG WAS ADDED TO OUR PURCHASE FOR THE TOWN. WITH ALL THE EXTRA MONEY WE DECIDED TO DO ANOTHER EXTRAVAGANT PROJECT, AND ALREADY HAVING THE MONEY REALLY HELPED THOSE EFFORTS. THE TROOP HAD ALSO NOTICED THAT SOME WORK NEEDED TO BE DONE WITH A MONUMENT IN OUR TOWN TRIANGLE, WHERE THE FLAGS WERE GOING TO BE PUT UP, SO THE ADDITIONAL MONEY WENT TOWARDS THAT PROJECT. THERE WILL BE A FLAG CEREMONY AT THE ERIE FIRE STATION ON VETERANS DAY, WITH THE BOY SCOUTS AND THE LEGION TO COMMEMORATE THE NEW FLAGS. EVERYONE IS INVITED TO THE FLAG CEREMONY AT THE ERIE FIRE STATION, 807 9TH AVE, ERIE, IL 61250. ERIE IS PROUD OF THEIR COMMUNITY AND WANT TO BETTER IT IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE. THIS IS JUST ONE SMALL ASPECT THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP. FIELDS OF FAITH BY BREANNE RAMIREZ SEVENTH GRADE FRIENDS, GAMES, FOOD, AND FUN! ALL OF THESE CAN BE FOUND AT FIELDS OF FAITH. FIELDS OF FAITH WAS RECENTLY HELD AT THE ERIE MIDDLE SCHOOL. EVERYONE WAS SMILING AND HAVING FUN, MIDDLE SCHOOLERS AND HIGH SCHOOLERS ALIKE, TALKED AND WALKED AROUND THE FOOTBALL FIELD UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO BEGIN THE EVENING OF FUN AND FELLOWSHIP BY LISTEN TO THE SPEAKERS. THE FIRST SPEAKER CAME UP AND ANNOUNCED THE GAME WE WOULD BE PLAYING, MIX N MINGLE. AFTER WE PLAYED THE GAME, WE SAT DOWN AND HAD A QUICK LESSON AND PRAYER. THE LESSON WAS IN REGARDS TO FORGIVENESS. HE TOLD US THE DEFINITION FROM THE DICTIONARY WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT FORGIVENESS ACTUALLY IS AND HOW FORGIVENESS IS A KEY ASPECT TO OUR LIVES. THEN SOMEONE CAME UP TO THE MICROPHONE WITH A GUITAR; THEY SANG AN OLD HYMN AND PLAYED GUITAR AT THE SAME TIME. IT WAS WONDERFUL. AFTER WE LISTENED TO HIM PLAY THE GUITAR AND SING, WE PRAYED IN GROUPS; THE GROUPS WERE DIVIDED AMONG THE SPORT EACH OF US PLAY. WE ALL PRAYED FOR A FEW MINUTES, HOPING THAT OUR SEASONS WOULD GO WELL AND FOR EVERYONES SAFETY THROUGHOUT THE SEASON. WE CONCLUDED THE EVENING WITH SNACK AND HOT CHOCOLATE. BEFORE WE KNEW IT, IT WAS TIME FOR US TO GO HOME. EVERYONE HAD FUN AND WE ALL LEFT WITH A SMILE ON OUR FACE AND GOD IN OUR HEART. MILLION MINUTE CHALLENGE BY MARY STOCK SIXTH GRADE ERIE MIDDLE SCHOOL HAS ACCEPTED THE TASK OF A MILLION MINUTE CHALLENGE, STARTING EARLY SEPTEMBER AND RUNNING THROUGH CHRISTMAS BREAK. THIS IS MEANT TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS, THEIR FAMILIES, AND THE FACULTY AND STAFF TO READ. RECENTLY, ERIE MIDDLE SCHOOL READING TEACHERS HAVE COME TOGETHER AND DECIDED THAT THE SCHOOLS SHOULD DO THE MILLION MINUTE READING CHALLENGE, OR MMC. WHAT IS THIS, YOU MAY ASK? THE MMC IS A COMMUNITY-WIDE READING PROJECT, WHICH ENCOURAGES THE YOUNG ADULTS OF THIS SCHOOL TO READ. THE PROJECT STARTED ON THE 15TH OF SEPTEMBER, AND ENDS SOMETIME NEAR THE BEGINNING OF WINTER BREAK. THERE ARE PRIZES FOR EACH 600 MINUTES A STUDENT READS. THEY ARE CALLED STEPS, AND THE PRIZES VARY FROM BOOKSTORE CASH, FREE BOOKS AND EVEN A PIZZA PARTY. TOTAL, THERE ARE SIX STEPS. BESIDES THE STEPS BEING INDIVIDUAL PERKS, STEP ONE IS A $1 ALA CARTE ITEM AND STEP TWO IS A READING LOG PASS OR HOMEWORK PASS FOR THE EIGHTH GRADERS. FOR STEP THREE, YOU GET A CANDY BAR, FOUR, YOU GET TWO DOLLARS FOR THE LIBRARY STORE, AND STEP FIVE, AND YOU GET $5 TOWARD A BOOK FROM SCHOLASTIC. FINALLY, THE LAST STEP, STEP SIX, IS A PIZZA PARTY RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS BREAK. WHICHEVER GRADE HAS THE MOST MINUTES READ GETS BRAGGING RIGHTS AND THE SATISFACTION FROM KNOWING THAT THEIR CLASS IS THE SMARTEST. GOOD LUCK, AND MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR. -- "HUNGER GAMES," BY SUZANNE COLLINS A DAY AT THE POND BY SHAE WINTERS FIFTH GRADE ERIE MIDDLE SCHOOL FIFTH GRADERS GO ON A YEARLY POND TRIP TO ROCK RIVER MARINA IN CAMANCHE, IA. ON THE DAY OF THE POND TRIP, THE MORNING STARTED LIKE EVERY OTHER MORNING, EXCEPT ON THIS DAY WE HAD TO WEAR SHORTS UNDER OUR PANTS AND SOCKS PULLED UP TO OUR KNEES. WE LOOKED SILLY, BUT AT 9 AM WE DIDNT CARE. WE REPORTED TO CHUCK JACOBSEN AT THE BOAT DOCK FOR OUR TOUR ON THE BLUE HERON. WE SAW MANY BIRDS, INCLUDING SOME REAL BLUE HERONS. WE ALSO COLLECTED ROCKS; I COLLECTED A VERY PRETTY ONE, BUT WHEN I WAS SKIPPING ROCKS, I ACCIDENTALLY THREW THE ONE I ACTUALLY WANTED TO KEEP. WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GO BACK FOR OUR TOUR OF THE MUSEUM, CHUCK LET US DRIVE; I TURNED THE BOAT AROUND AND WE HEADED BACK. IN THE MUSEUM THERE WERE ROOMS WITH FISH, OF ALL KINDS, IN THE TANKS. THE TOUR GUIDE TOLD US ABOUT THE FOOD CHAINS OF THE FISH. IN THE NEXT ROOM THERE WAS A REPLICA OF A POND ECOSYSTEM. CHUCK ALSO TOLD US ABOUT THE ECOSYSTEMS AND THE ANIMALS IN THEM. THERE WERE SOME SNAKES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AND HE TOOK THEM OUT OF THEIR CAGES. HE TOLD US ABOUT THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SNAKES AND ABOUT HOW SOME OF THEM ARE POISONOUS AND VENOMOUS BUT OTHERS ARENT. FINALLY, IT WAS TIME FOR THE POND STUDY! THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS PLAY A GAME ABOUT THE NEEDS TO A GOOD HABITAT. WE WERE TO SIT, FORM A CIRCLE AND LEAN ON ONE ANOTHER. WITH A LITTLE PUSH THE WHOLE CIRCLE COLLAPSED; MR. TEMPLE SAID THAT IF ONE NEED IS LOST, THE WHOLE HABITAT COLLAPSES. AFTER THAT IT WAS TIME FOR OUR GATHERING OF THE ORGANISMS! SOME PEOPLE CAUGHT CRAYFISH; OTHERS CAUGHT CATFISH AND OTHER SMALLER FISH. I CAUGHT BUGS, TOO MANY BUGS FOR MY TASTE. IT WAS FUN! SOME PEOPLE DIDNT HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS THE REST OF US THOUGH; THEY FELL IN THE WATER. OUR DAY WAS COMPLETE; WE RODE BACK TO THE SCHOOL WITH OUR ORGANISMS IN TOW. WE HAD AN AMAZING ADVENTURE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ALL; THE ROCK RIVER MARINA IN CAMANCHE, IOWA, IS A GREAT, EDUCATIONAL PLACE.
573	THE COMPANY'S NEW PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HELP CHINESE COMPANIES WORKING IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS INDUSTRY AS IF CHINESE FACTORIES WEREN'T ALREADY PRODUCING ENOUGH OF OUR GADGETS, CHIP DESIGNER ARM HOLDINGS WANTS TO HELP CHINESE STARTUPS PRODUCE MORE WEARABLE DEVICES, ROBOTS AND SMART HOME PRODUCTS. TO THAT END, THE U.K. COMPANY IS SETTING UP AN "ACCELERATOR" IN BEIJING STAFFED WITH EXPERTS WHO CAN PROVIDE CHINESE COMPANIES WITH TIPS ON PRODUCT DESIGN INCLUDING WHICH CHIPS OR SOFTWARE TO USE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME ARM HAS CREATED SUCH A PROGRAM, AND ITS AIM IS TO REMOVE ANY BARRIERS THAT MIGHT HINDER CHINESE STARTUPS FROM QUICKLY DELIVERING THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COUNTRY IS ALREADY HOME TO NUMEROUS COMPANIES, LARGE AND SMALL, DEVELOPING SMARTPHONES, WEARABLES AND OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES. HOWEVER, LOCAL STARTUPS TYPICALLY POSSESS FEW RESOURCES, AND NOT ENOUGH KNOW-HOW TO QUICKLY DELIVER THEIR PRODUCTS, ACCORDING TO ARM. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE INCLUDE SELECTING THE RIGHT COMPONENTS, OPTIMIZING THE DEVICE'S SOFTWARE, OR FINDING OUT WHICH OPERATING SYSTEM BEST FITS THEIR NEEDS. ARM'S ACCELERATOR PROGRAM WANTS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES BY PROVIDING WORKSHOPS, TRAINING AND DESIGN SERVICES RELATING TO THE COMPANY'S OWN CHIP DESIGNS. THE U.K. COMPANY IS BEST KNOWN FOR SUPPLYING THE PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY USED IN MOST SMARTPHONE AND TABLETS. BUT ARM ALSO WANTS TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS INTO IOT AREAS SUCH AS SMART CITIES, SMART HOMES AND HEALTHCARE, WHERE ITS LOW-POWER CONSUMING PROCESSORS COULD FLOURISH. LAST YEAR, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS MBED PLATFORMTO HELP VENDORS BUILD IOT SYSTEMS. SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT ARM'S ACCELERATOR IN CHINA WILL ALSO BE OFFERING DESIGN SERVICES AROUND MBED. BUT ON MONDAY IN BEIJING, ARM'S CEO SIMON SEGARS SAID THAT THE ACCELERATOR WILL ALSO OPEN ITSELF TO OTHER IOT PLATFORMS FROM OTHER COMPANIES. THE GOAL IS TO ESSENTIALLY CONNECT CHINESE STARTUPS WITH THE APPROPRIATE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS, MANY OF WHOM ARE ALREADY PARTNERS WITH ARM, HE ADDED. THE ACCELERATOR WILL WORK THROUGH A COMPANY ARM HAS ESTABLISHED WITH BEIJING-BASEDTHUNDERSOFT, WHICH ALREADYSPECIALIZES IN HELPING SMARTPHONE AND TABLET VENDORS REFINE THE SOFTWARE ON THEIR DEVICES.THE ACCELERATOR'S FIRST OFFICE WILL BE BASED IN BEIJING, BUT TO REACH MORE STARTUPS, FOUR OR FIVE OTHER OFFICES WILL BE SET UP ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO. ALL CHINESE COMPANIES ARE INVITED TO JOIN. THE NEW PROGRAM WILL SURELY HELP PROMOTE ARM'S CHIP DESIGNS AND SOFTWARE, BUT IT COULD ALSO ASSIST CHINESE VENDORS IN CREATING SUCCESSFUL IOT PRODUCTS,SAID KITTY FOK, AN ANALYST WITH RESEARCH FIRM IDC. IN THE FUTURE, ARM COULD EVEN ADVISE THESE CHINESE STARTUPS ON WHAT OPPORTUNITIES ARE EMERGING IN THE MARKET, OR WHICH CUSTOMERS TO TARGET, SHE ADDED.

575	GOOD MORNING TRADERS, AS OF THIS WRITING 4:10 AM EST, HERES WHAT WE SEE: US DOLLAR: DOWN AT 96.240 THE US DOLLAR IS DOWN 183 TICKS AND TRADING AT 96.240.  ROMETTY | CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, IBM BALAJI S. ENERGIES: OCTOBER CRUDE IS DOWN AT 46.20. FINANCIALS: THE SEPT 30 YEAR BOND IS UP 22 TICKS AND TRADING AT 156.21. INDICES: THE SEPT S&P 500 EMINI ES CONTRACT IS DOWN 44 TICKS AND TRADING AT 1935.00. GOLD: THE OCTOBER GOLD CONTRACT IS TRADING DOWN AT 1123.80. GOLD IS 2 TICKS LOWER THAN ITS CLOSE. INITIAL CONCLUSION THIS IS NOT A CORRELATED MARKET. THE DOLLAR IS DOWN- AND OIL IS DOWN- WHICH IS NOT NORMAL AND THE 30 YEAR BOND IS TRADING HIGHER. THE FINANCIALS SHOULD ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH THE US DOLLAR SUCH THAT IF THE DOLLAR IS LOWER THEN BONDS SHOULD FOLLOW AND VICE-VERSA. THE INDICES ARE DOWN AND CRUDE IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED. GOLD IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED US DOLLAR TRADING UP.  SHE ASKED ME IF I HAD EVER PUT ON A TOURNIQUET AND I SAID NO, OTHER THAN IN TRAINING, SO SHE TALKED ME THROUGH IT. I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT GOLD HAS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US DOLLAR AS WHEN THE US DOLLAR IS DOWN, GOLD TENDS TO RISE IN VALUE AND VICE-VERSA. THINK OF IT AS A SEESAW, WHEN ONE IS UP THE OTHER SHOULD BE DOWN.  AS TRADERS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS AND PROCEED WITH YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN. ALL OF ASIA TRADED LOWER. PLEASE NOTE THE CHINA EXCHANGES ARE A BANK HOLIDAY. AS OF THIS WRITING ALL OF EUROPE IS TRADING LOWER. POSSIBLE CHALLENGES TO TRADERS TODAY - FOMC MEMBER LACKER SPEAKS AT 8:10 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS M/M IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - NON-FARM EMPLOYMENT CHANGE IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST.  HE SURVIVED A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE IN FEBRUARY AFTER POOR POLLING AND A SERIOUS OF GAFFES IGNITED A BACKBENCH REVOLT. THIS IS MAJOR. - UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. CURRENCIES YESTERDAY THE SWISS FRANC MADE ITS MOVE AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AFTER THE UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS NUMBERS CAME OUT. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND THAT TIME AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHARTS BELOW THE USD GAVE A SIGNAL AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST, WHILE THE SWISS FRANC ALSO GAVE A SIGNAL AT JUST  ABOUT THE SAME TIME. LOOK AT THE CHARTS BELOW AND YOULL SEE A PATTERN FOR BOTH ASSETS. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH. THESE CHARTS REPRESENT THE LATEST VERSION OF TREND FOLLOWING TRADES AND IVE CHANGED THE TIMEFRAME TO A RENKO CHART TO DISPLAY BETTER. THIS REPRESENTED A SHORTING OPPORTUNITY ON THE SWISS FRANC, AS A TRADER YOU COULD HAVE NETTED 20 PLUS TICKS ON THIS TRADE. WE ADDED A DONCHIAN CHANNEL TO THE CHARTS TO SHOW THE SIGNALS MORE CLEARLY. REMEMBER EACH TICK ON THE SWISS FRANC IS EQUAL TO $12.50 VERSUS $10.00 THAT WE USUALLY SEE FOR CURRENCIES. CHARTS COURTESY OF TREND FOLLOWING TRADES BUILT ON A NINJA TRADER PLATFORM BIAS YESTERDAY WE  SAID OUR BIAS WAS NEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER. THE MARKETS MEANDERED INTO AND OUT OF POSITIVE TERRITORY ALL SESSION LONG BUT THE DOW CLOSED HIGHER BY 24 POINTS HOWEVER THE NASDAQ DROPPED BY 17, THE S&P CLIMBED BY 2. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS JOBS FRIDAY OUR BIAS IS NEUTRAL. COULD THIS CHANGE? OF COURSE. REMEMBER ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN A VOLATILE MARKET. COMMENTARY YESTERDAY WE SAID OUR BIAS WAS NEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS (USD AND BONDS) WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER AND USUALLY THATS NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR AN UPSIDE DAY. WHAT SEE WAS FOLLOW THRU ON THE PART OF THE INDICES HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS JOBS FRIDAY WE WILL MAINTAIN A NEUTRAL BIAS AS WE ALWAYS DO FOR JOBS FRIDAY. WHY? BECAUSE THE MARKETS HAVE NEVER SHOWN ANY SENSE OF NORMALCY ON JOBS FRIDAY OR FOMC DAY HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS.  HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. YESTERDAYS UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS CAME IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED AT 282,000 VERSUS 273,000 EXPECTED. TIME WILL TELL IF THIS HAS ANY EFFECT ON NON-FARM PAYROLLS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE ITS A GIVEN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WE WORK HARD FOR WHATEVER WE HAVE; WE SHOULD TAKE TIME TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOR. !!!!
576	REVISE -- IT WAS EARLIER REPORTED THAT THE COMPANY IS PLANNING TO DELIVER ABROAD MILITARY WEAPONRY AND HARDWARE FOR THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF AT LEAST $13 BILLION. OVER THE PAST YEAR, BACK WHEN WESTERN SANCTIONS DID NOT TARGET RUSSIAS ARMS MANUFACTURING AND EXPORTING FIRMS, ROSOBORONEXPORT EXPORTED ARMS FOR THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF $13.2 BILLION. RUSSIA IS ALSO RECEIVING MORE OFFERS FROM FOREIGN PARTNERS IN LEASING RUSSIAN MILITARY HARDWARE, ACCORDING TO GORESLAVSKIY. IN COLLABORATION WITH NEW DELHI, MOSCOW IS DEVELOPING RUSSIAN HELICOPTER KA-226T IN INDIA. THIS MODEL OF THE HELICOPTER CAN BE USED DURING RESCUE OPERATIONS IN INACCESSIBLE HIGH-MOUNTAIN AREAS OF INDIA. RUSSIA IS PUSHING ITS HARDWARE TO INTERNATIONAL MARKET OVER 15 YEARS SINCE ROSOBORONEXPORT WAS FOUNDED, THE VOLUME OF EXPORTS OF ARMS FOR GROUND FORCES HAS INCREASED BY TEN TIMES. WE CONFIDENTLY COMPETE WITH LEADING DEVELOPERS AND CAN OFFER THE MARKET OUR COMPLEX, ALL-INCLUSIVE SOLUTIONS IN THE FIELD OF NATIONAL SECURITY, GORESLAVSKIY NOTED. ACCORDING TO HIM, THE COMPANY IS PUSHING OVER 700 UNITS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. THE MAJOR CONTRACTS FOR ARMS DEVELOPED BY RUSSIA INCLUDE: THE DELIVERY OF T-90C TANKS TO INDIA AND AZERBAIJAN, THE BMP-3 FIGHTING VEHICLE TO AZERBAIJAN AND INDONESIA, SELF-PROPELLED ARTILLERY AND HEAVY FLAME-THROWING SYSTEMS TO IRAQ AND AZERBAIJAN, WEAPON SUPPLIES TO INDIA AND UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, ENGINEER EQUIPMENT TO IRAQ AS WELL AS ANTI-TANK COMPLEXES TO BAHREIN AND NAMIBIA. ALSO, RUSSIA IS WORKING ON MODERNIZING A NUMBER OF PREVIOUSLY DELIVERED HARDWARE, INCLUDING THE ONES IT DELIVERED TO ALGERIA. THE 10TH RUSSIA ARMS EXPO RAE-2015 INTERNATIONAL ARMS SHOW OPENED IN THE URAL CITY OF NIZHNY TAGIL ON SEPTEMBER 9 AND WILL RUN THROUGH SEPTEMBER 12. THE MOST PROMINENT SHOWCASES TOOK PLACE ON AN OPEN TRAINING RANGE OF OVER 400,000 SQUARE METERS, WHICH ALLOWED RUSSIAN MILITARIES TO SHOW OFF COMBAT AND OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MILITARY HARDWARE IN REAL TIME. RUSSIA ARMS EXPO RAE-2015 ORGANIZERS EARLIER SAID THAT THE SHOW WOULD BE ATTENDED BY AT LEAST 65 FOREIGN DELEGATIONS. THE SHOW ALSO INCLUDES BRAND NEW RUSSIAN ARMORED VEHICLE MODELS SUCH AS THE T-14 ARMATA MAIN BATTLE TANK AND HEAVY BMP T-15 ON THE ARMATA PLATFORM. LEAKED DETAILS OF RUSSIAS MILITARY DELIVERIES TO SYRIA DETAILS OF THE DELIVERIES OF RUSSIAN ARMS TO THE BASHAR AL-ASSAD REGIME IN SYRIA HAVE SURFACED IN THE RUSSIAN MEDIA. RUSSIA HAS CONFIRMED PROVIDING MILITARY AID TO SYRIA AND THE PRESENCE OF ITS MILITARY EXPERTS IN THE COUNTRY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN KOMMERSANT NEWSPAPER . AS OF TODAY, RUSSIA IS HOLDING TALKS WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO REACH AGREEMENTS ON THE DELIVERY OF A FEW BATCHES OF SMALL ARMS, GRENADE LAUNCHERS, THE BTR-82A ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS, THE URAL MILITARY VEHICLES AS WELL AS OTHER WEAPONRY NEEDED FOR LOCAL MILITARY ACTIONS AND DEPLOYING THE SYRIAN ARMY TO DIFFERENT SPOTS OF THE COUNTRY, ACCORDING TO SOURCES CITED BY KOMMERSANT. FOR MONTHS, THE KREMLIN HAS BEEN PUSHING FORWARD THE IDEA TO INCLUDE THE SYRIAN ARMY INTO THE U.S.-LED ANTI-TERRORIST COALITION. WASHINGTON CONSIDERS ANY MILITARY AID FROM RUSSIA TO THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT UNACCEPTABLE, ACCORDING TO THE SPOKESMAN FOR U.S. EMBASSY TO RUSSIA, WILLIAM STEVENS. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE TO PROVIDE THE ASSAD REGIME WITH ANY SUPPORT, AS IT ALLOWS ASSAD TO AVOID FINDING THE SOLUTION TO END THE CONFLICT, STEVENS SAID.  WHEN ASKED BY KOMMERSANT NEWSPAPER WHY THE WEST DOES NOT WANT TO JOIN ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT, STEVENS SAID THAT WE ARE ALREADY WAGING A WAR AGAINST ISIS WITH 60 FOREIGN COALITION PARTNERS. HE ADDED THAT THE ASSAD REGIME CANT BE A U.S. ALLY IN THIS WAR. BIPOLAR WORLD WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA ON ONE SIDE VALUEWALK EARLIER REPORTED THAT MOSCOW HAS PLANS TO TAKE OVER THE MIDDLE EAST WITH ITS ARMS. THE KREMLIN IS CURRENTLY INTERESTED IN REACHING MILITARY CONTRACTS WITH EGYPT, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN AND PAKISTAN.  WEAPONS IN THE COUNTRY, WHILE IRAN IS WAITING FOR RUSSIAS DELIVERY OF THE S-300 ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEMS BY THE END OF 2015. PAKISTAN, A TRADITIONAL RIVAL OF RUSSIA, IS PURCHASING RUSSIAS MI-35 COMBAT HELICOPTERS ALONG WITH THE KLIMOV RD-93 ENGINES FOR ITS JF-17 MULTI-ROLE FIGHTERS. ITS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PAKISTAN REQUIRES CHINAS ENGINEERS AND HELP IN CO-PRODUCTION AND CO-DEVELOPMENT OF JF-17 FIGHTER JETS. GIVEN THE WARMING RELATIONS BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND RUSSIA, THERE ARE INDICATIONS OF THE EMERGENCE OF THE WORLDS NEW SUPERPOWER AXIS BETWEEN RUSSIA, PAKISTAN AND CHINA , WHICH WORRIES WASHINGTON. IF SUCH A TRIANGLE IS CREATED, IT WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO A BIPOLAR WORLD WITH CHINA, RUSSIA, PAKISTAN AND A NUMBER OF OTHER AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL ASIA ON ONE SIDE, AND THE U.S., EU, JAPAN AND THEIR ASIAN ALLIES ON THE OTHER SIDE.

THE KREMLIN HAS REACHED A NUMBER OF CONTRACTS TO SELL THE KORNET-EM LONG-RANGE ANTI-TANK GUIDED MISSILE SYSTEMS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES, ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER OF THE MISSILE SYSTEM. IMAGE SOURCE: VITALY V. KUZMIN THE AGREEMENTS ON DELIVERY OF KORNET-EM [MISSILE] COMPLEX TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN ALREADY CONCLUDED, AN OFFICIAL FROM THE INSTRUMENT DESIGN BUREAU (KBP) TOLD RIA NOVOSTI DURING THE RAE-2015 MILITARY EXHIBITION ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER, THE OFFICIAL DID NOT SHED ANY LIGHT AS TO WHICH COUNTRIES RUSSIA REACHED AGREEMENTS WITH. THE KORNET-EM MISSILES WITH SHAPED-CHARGE WARHEADS HAVE A RANGE OF ABOUT 5 MILES, AND MISSILES WITH HIGH-EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF A RANGE OF ABOUT 6.2 MILES, AS DESCRIBED BY THE OFFICIAL. THE KORNET SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF FIRING TWO MISSILES SIMULTANEOUSLY AT ONE TARGET FOR HIGH ELIMINATION PROBABILITY. MEANWHILE, THE MISSILE WITH A HIGH-EXPLOSIVE WARHEAD CAN ELIMINATE AIRCRAFT TARGETS SUCH AS HELICOPTER AND DRONES. THE MUCH DESIRED BY FOREIGN CUSTOMERS MISSILE SYSTEM WAS SHOWCASED AT THE MAKS AIRSHOW IN AUGUST 2011. THE MAKS 2015 AIRSHOW INCLUDED SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, DRONES, HELICOPTERS AND OTHER BRAND NEW AIRCRAFT, WHICH KEPT RUSSIAN MILITARY MINDS OCCUPIED FOR SEVERAL YEARS IF NOT DECADES. THE COMPANY (KBP) IS A KEY RUSSIAN MANUFACTURER OF HIGH-PRECISION WEAPONS, GRENADE LAUNCHERS AS WELL AS MODERN AIRCRAFT GUNS. U.S. SANCTIONS DID NOTHING TO RUSSIAS ARMS EXPORTS ROSOBORONEXPORT, AN INTERMEDIARY AGENCY FOR RUSSIAS EXPORTS/IMPORTS OF ARMS, HAS STATED THAT U.S. SANCTIONS HAVE NOT AFFECTED ARMS EXPORT OF RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTINS COUNTRY. WE HAVE NO DOUBTS OF FULFILLING THE PLAN FOR THIS YEAR, DEPUTY CEO OF ROSOBORONEXPORT SERGEI GORESLAVSKIY TOLD RUSSIAN STATE-OWNED ITAR-TASS . HE ADDED THAT WESTERN SANCTIONS HAVE NOT AFFECTED RUSSIAS ARMS EXPORT.

580	HISTORIC PRESERVATIONISTS AND BUXTON RESIDENTS WHO FOUGHT FOR FIVE YEARS TO SAVE A HISTORIC SCHOOL BUILDING SAID THEY WEREDISMAYED TO SEE IT BEING TORN DOWN. THE FORMER SAMUEL D. HANSON SCHOOL WASDEMOLISHED THIS WEEK, NEARLY FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE MAINE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATIVE DISTRICT 6 BOARD FIRST VOTED TO RAZE IT AND THREE MONTHS AFTER IT WAS DECLARED UNSAFE BY A TOWN INSPECTOR. THE SCHOOL WAS NAMED TO MAINE PRESERVATIONS LIST OF MOST ENDANGERED HISTORIC PROPERTIES IN 2011. COMMUNITY MEMBERS TRIED FOR YEARS TO SAVE THE BUILDING, WHICH WAS CLOSED WHEN THE NEW BUXTON CENTER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OPENED IN 2010. THE HANSON SCHOOL, BUILT IN 1930, COULD HAVE FOUND A NEW LIFE AS A COMMUNITY CENTER, ACCORDING TO MEMBERS OF THE GROUP THAT WANTED IT SAVED. TWO OTHER FORMER SCHOOL BUILDINGS ONE IN THE BAR MILLS VILLAGE OF BUXTON AND THE OTHER IN HOLLIS HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM DEMOLITION. ON THURSDAY, CREWS PULLED DOWN THE REMAINING WALLS OF THE SCHOOL. GAPING HOLES IN THE WALLS REVEALED A GYM WITH A BASKETBALL HOOP STILL IN PLACE, ALONG WITH PILES OF DESKS AND CHAIRS. THIS WAS A TOTAL AND COMPLETE FIASCO, SAID MEG GARDNER, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE BUXTON-HOLLIS HISTORICAL SOCIETY. WHEN THEY WERE TAKING DOWN THE BUILDING THIS WEEK, ONE OF THE WORKERS SAID, SHE WAS A TOUGH OLD BIRD. SHE DIDNT WANT TO COME DOWN. SUPERINTENDENT FRANK SHERBURNE AND REBECCA BOWLEY, CHAIRWOMAN OF THE SCHOOL BOARD, DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT THURSDAY. AFTER THE DISTRICTS NEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OPENED IN 2010 AND THE CENTRAL OFFICE AND OTHER PROGRAMS WERE RELOCATED, SCHOOL OFFICIALS WERE LEFT WITH THREE FORMER SCHOOL BUILDINGS: THE HANSON SCHOOL, THE OLD BAR MILLS HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH HAD BEEN USED AS A CENTRAL OFFICE, AND THE OLD HOLLIS HIGH SCHOOL. THE BAR MILLS SCHOOL IS NOW LEASED TO THE BUXTON-HOLLIS HISTORICAL SOCIETY, WHICH IS RENOVATING IT. THE FORMER HIGH SCHOOL IN HOLLIS WAS SOLD. THE FATE OF THE HANSON SCHOOL BUILDING REMAINED IN QUESTION FOR YEARS AFTER BUXTON DECLINED TO LEASE IT FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. TOWN VOTERS FOUR YEARS AGO REJECTED A REFERENDUM EFFORT TO CONVERT IT TO A COMMUNITY CENTER BY NINE VOTES. THE SCHOOL BOARD VOTED MAY 18 TO DEMOLISH THE HANSON SCHOOL, WHICH WAS NO LONGER BEING USED BY THE DISTRICT. ON JUNE 10, THE BOARD VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO UPHOLD ITS PREVIOUS VOTE. THE COST OF DEMOLITION IS ESTIMATED AT $170,000. ACCORDING TO STATE LAW, A SCHOOL BUILDING CAN BE DEMOLISHED IF THE SCHOOL BOARD DETERMINES THE PROPERTY COULD BE BETTER USED FOR OTHER EDUCATION-RELATED PURPOSES WITHOUT THE BUILDING OR IF THE BUILDING HAS BEEN CONDEMNED BY LOCAL OR STATE OFFICIALS FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS. GREG PAXTON, DIRECTOR OF MAINE PRESERVATION, AND GARDNER BOTH SAID THE SCHOOL BOARD SHOULD HAVE HELD A PUBLIC REFERENDUM VOTE TO AUTHORIZE THE DEMOLITION, BUT THE LAW INDICATES THAT DECISION IS UP TO THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE SCHOOL UNIT. BUXTON CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER FRED FARNHAM, WHO HAS SINCE RETIRED, ON JUNE 23 LISTED THE HANSON SCHOOL AS AN UNSAFE STRUCTURE. THE NOTICE POSTED ON THE BUILDING SAID IT CONSTITUTES A FIRE HAZARD, UNSUITABLE FOR OCCUPANCY, STRUCTURALLY UNSAFE, CONSTITUTES HAZARD TO HEALTH AND SAFETY AND IS OTHERWISE DANGEROUS TO LIFE OR PROPERTY. IN A LETTER TO SCHOOL OFFICIALS, FARNHAM SAID THE BUILDING WAS NO LONGER SAFE FOR OCCUPANCY AND WAS BEING DECLARED UNSAFE. REMEDIATION OF MOLD AND LEAD IN THE BUILDING WOULD COST $35,000, HE SAID. BEYOND THAT, THERE HAS BEEN STUDY OF THE BUILDING COMPONENTS THAT WOULD NEED REPAIR, REPLACEMENT OR DISPOSAL TO BRING IT UP TO MINIMUM BUILDING STANDARDS AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF $2,170,038, HE WROTE. THE HANSON SCHOOL WAS BUILT IN 1930 AFTER THE PREVIOUS SCHOOL IN THE BUXTON CENTER LOCATION BURNED DOWN; THE GYM ANNEX WAS ADDED IN 1952. THE SCHOOL WAS NAMED FOR SAMUEL D. HANSON, WHO RAN THE HANSON COAT FACTORY AND EMPLOYED MORE THAN 1,200 PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM WOMEN WHO DID PIECEWORK AT HOME, MAKING COATS FOR UNION SOLDIERS DURING THE CIVIL WAR. THE BUILDING WAS A COMMUNITY ASSET, PAXTON SAID. ITS UNFORTUNATE NOT TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES FOR REUSE AND RESALE. THESE BUILDINGS CAN FIND NEW LIFE. PAXTON SAID 14 SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE BEEN RENOVATED SINCE 2008 USING HISTORIC REHABILITATION TAX CREDITS AND ARE NOW USED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES, INCLUDING AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING. GARDNER, WHO HAD TRIED TO SAVE THE SCHOOL ALONG WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY HERITAGE ALLIANCE OF RURAL MAINE, SAID IT WAS A SHAME IT WASNT PRESERVED. SHE SAID ADVOCATES TRIED TO RALLY BUXTON RESIDENTS FOR SUPPORT, BUT MOST PEOPLE SEEMED SURPRISED WHEN DEMOLITION ACTUALLY BEGAN. THERE IS A LOT OF APATHY ON THE PART OF TOWNSFOLK, SHE SAID. PEOPLE SEEMED UNAWARE IT WAS GOING ON. WE TRIED TO GET THE WORD, BUT THEY JUST WERENT PAYING ATTENTION.

THE REVIEW, BY A GROUP UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF FORMER BEAMISH AND CRAWFORD MANAGING DIRECTOR ALF SMIDDY, WILL MAKE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON IMPROVING LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN CORK. WHY CORK SHOULD RESIST ATTEMPTS TO MERGE COUNCILS A CRAZY IDEA FOR CORK CORK CITY MUST RETAIN POWER TO SELF-GOVERN, SAY 18 FORMER MAYORS THE IRISH TIMES UNDERSTANDS THAT AMONG THEM WILL BE A RECOMMENDATION THAT THE CITY AND COUNTY COUNCILS BE MERGED, AS HAPPENED IN LIMERICK AND WATERFORD. THE RECOMMENDATION IS THE MAJORITY VIEW OF THREE MEMBERS OF THE REVIEW GROUP: MR SMIDDY, SENIOR COUNSEL JOHN LUCEY AND FORMER KERRY COUNTY MANAGER TOM CURRAN.

583	OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES, JUST A FEW BREWERS HAVE TRIED OPENING A CRAFT BREWERY ON MAUI, AND FEW HAVE SUCCEEDED. BUT THIS YEAR MARKS THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF GARRETT AND MELANIE MARRERO'S MAUI BREWING CO. WHAT BEGAN WITH A BREWPUB IN LAHAINA, THE TOURISTY BEACH TOWN, SOON GREW TO INCLUDE A SEPARATE PRODUCTION BREWERY TO PRODUCE BEER IN CANS. BREWMASTER GARRETT GREW UP IN SAN DIEGO, WHERE HIS BEER-LOVING GRANDFATHER INTRODUCED HIM TO MICROBREWS, IMPORTS AND HOME-BREWING. GARRETT'S CAREER PATH MAY HAVE STARTED IN FINANCE AND INVESTMENT CONSULTING, BUT A MAUI VACATION IN 2001 DERAILED HIS PLANS. HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE HAWAIIAN ISLAND AND DECIDED HE WOULD EVENTUALLY OPEN A BREWERY THERE. MAUI BREWING MAKES FOUR FLAGSHIP BEERS, ALL IN CANS AND ALL BREWED YEAR-ROUND. BIKINI BLONDE LAGER IS A REFRESHING HELLES THAT'S LIGHT-BODIED FOR THE CLIMATE BUT STILL FULL-FLAVORED. BIG SWELL IPA IS AIMED AT HOP LOVERS, AND MANA WHEAT IS AN UNFILTERED AMERICAN WHEAT ALE BREWED WITH -- WHAT ELSE? -- PINEAPPLE. FOR THE MORE ADVENTUROUS, THERE'S A COCONUT PORTER, BREWED WITH TOASTED COCONUT, WHICH GIVES IT AN AMAZING AND VERY DIFFERENT TASTE PROFILE, WITH HINTS OF CHOCOLATE, COFFEE AND, OF COURSE, LOADS OF COCONUT FLAVOR. THE BREWERY ALSO DOES LIMITED RELEASES; OTHER BREWERIES CALL THOSE SEASONALS, BUT SINCE THERE'S ONLY ONE SEASON IN HAWAII, THEY DECIDED "LIMITED RELEASE" MADE MORE SENSE. THE LATEST ONE -- FOR FALL -- IS DOPPEL SHOT DOUBLE BOCK, A DOPPELBOCK WITH STRONG COFFEE NOTES. RECENT PAST RELEASES HAVE INCLUDED A LORENZINI DOUBLE IPA AND KIHEI KOLSCH. THE BREWPUB ALSO OFFERS 60 DIFFERENT BEERS. IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE ISLAND JUST YET, TAKE HEART: YOU CAN FIND MAUI BEER IN A DOZEN STATES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. THE MARREROS JUST ADDED A FEW MORE REASONS TO MAKE THE TREK, THOUGH. LAST YEAR, THEY ADDED A NEW 40,000-SQUARE-FOOT PRODUCTION BREWERY -- AND SOLD THE OLD ONE TO WHAT WILL BECOME MAUI'S SECOND BREWERY, KOHOLA BREWERY, WHICH HOPES TO OPEN LATER THIS YEAR. MAUI BREWING'S NEW FACILITY IS IN KIHEI, LOCATED (CONVENIENTLY) JUST 30 MINUTES SOUTH OF THE AIRPORT. THE TASTING ROOM IS OPEN FROM 11 A.M.-10 P.M. DAILY, WITH A ROTATING ARRAY OF FOOD TRUCKS. A MAUI BREWING RESTAURANT IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN EARLY 2017. AND THE BREWERY OFFERS TOURS AS WELL; RESERVATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED. SINCE MOVING INTO THE NEW DIGS, THE BREWERY HAS INCREASED PRODUCTION BY 75 PERCENT, AND SIX NEW FERMENTERS ARE DUE TO ARRIVE SHORTLY TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND. SOON, MAUI BREWING WILL HAVE A NEW SPOT ON OAHU, RIGHT IN THE HEART OF WAIKIKI. MAUI BREWING WILL TAKE OVER A 20,000-SQUARE-FOOT SPACE AT THE WAIKIKI BEACHCOMBER IN APRIL, WITH PLANS TO OPEN IN OCTOBER 2016. THEY'LL OPERATE MAUI BREWING WAIKIKI AS A RESTAURANT, SERVING ALL THEIR OWN BEERS AND MANY EXCLUSIVE BREWPUB BEERS. EVENTUALLY, THEY HOPE TO ADD A PILOT BREWERY SO THEY CAN CREATE UNIQUE BEERS FOR THE OAHU LOCATION. CHEERS! CONTACT JAY R. BROOKS AT BROOKSONBEER@GMAIL.COM .

584	IN 1851 A RADICAL LOOKING SCHOONER GHOSTED OUT OF THE AFTERNOON MIST AND SWIFTLY SAILED PAST THE ROYAL YACHT STATIONED IN THE SOLENT, BETWEEN THE ISLE OF WIGHT AND THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND, ON AN AFTERNOON WHEN QUEEN VICTORIA WAS WATCHING A SAILING RACE. AS THE SCHOONER, NAMED AMERICA, PASSED THE ROYAL YACHT IN FIRST POSITION, AND SALUTED BY DIPPING ITS ENSIGN THREE TIMES, QUEEN VICTORIA ASKED ONE OF HER ATTENDANTS TO TELL HER WHO WAS IN SECOND PLACE.YOUR MAJESTY, THERE IS NO SECOND, CAME THE REPLY. THAT PHRASE, JUST FOUR WORDS, IS STILL THE BEST DESCRIPTION OF THE AMERICAS CUP, AND HOW IT REPRESENTS THE SINGULAR PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE. THAT DAY IN AUGUST, 1851, THE YACHT AMERICA, REPRESENTING THE YOUNG NEW YORK YACHT CLUB, WOULD GO ON TO BEAT THE BEST THE BRITISH COULD OFFER AND WIN THE ROYAL YACHT SQUADRONS 100 POUND CUP. THIS WAS MORE THAN A SIMPLE BOAT RACE HOWEVER, AS IT SYMBOLISED A GREAT VICTORY FOR THE NEW WORLD OVER THE OLD, A TRIUMPH THAT UNSEATED GREAT BRITAIN AS THE WORLDS UNDISPUTED MARITIME POWER. THE TROPHY WOULD GO TO THE YOUNG DEMOCRACY OF THE UNITED STATES AND IT WOULD BE WELL OVER 100 YEARS BEFORE IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM NEW YORK. SHORTLY AFTER AMERICA WON THE 100 GUINEA CUP IN 1851, NEW YORK YACHT CLUB COMMODORE JOHN COX STEVENS AND THE REST OF HIS OWNERSHIP SYNDICATE SOLD THE CELEBRATED SCHOONER AND RETURNED HOME TO NEW YORK AS HEROES. THEY DONATED THE TROPHY TO THE NEW YORK YACHT CLUB UNDER A DEED OF GIFT, WHICH STATED THAT THE TROPHY WAS TO BE A PERPETUAL CHALLENGE CUP FOR FRIENDLY COMPETITION BETWEEN NATIONS. THUS WAS BORN THE AMERICAS CUP, NAMED AFTER THE WINNING SCHOONER AMERICA, AS OPPOSED TO THE COUNTRY. THE AMERICAS CUP IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST DIFFICULT TROPHY IN SPORT TO WIN. IN THE MORE THAN 150 YEARS SINCE THAT FIRST RACE OFF ENGLAND, ONLY FOUR NATIONS HAVE WON WHAT IS OFTEN CALLED THE OLDEST TROPHY IN INTERNATIONAL SPORT. FOR SOME PERSPECTIVE, CONSIDER THAT THERE HAD BEEN NINE CONTESTS FOR THE AMERICAS CUP BEFORE THE FIRST MODERN OLYMPIC GAMES WERE HELD IN ATHENS IN 1896.

CLINICIANS AT SOLSTICE EAST UTILIZE THE FOLLOWING FORMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY TO TREAT TEENS: EMDR: (EYE MOVEMENT DESENSITIZATION AND REPROCESSING) IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED TECHNIQUE USED TO TREAT TRAUMA AND ANXIETY. THIS FORM OF PSYCHOTHERAPY HELPS DAMPEN THE POWER OF EMOTIONALLY-CHARGED MEMORIES OF PAST TRAUMATIC EVENTS, SAYS DAN HADLEY, M.S., LMFT, DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL SERVICES AT SOLSTICE EAST. TF-CBT: (TRAUMA FOCUSED COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY) PROVIDES PSYCHOEDUCATION ON TRAUMA AND HOW IT IMPACTS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL HEALTH.

587	UPDATE -- THE SEC HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS AND ISSUES RELATING TO THE HIRING OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS FOR SOME TIME. NOW IT HAS FILED A SETTLED ACTION CENTERED ON BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES WHICH CONTAINS A CAUTIONARY NOTE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT UPDATED THEIR COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES IN VIEW OF THESE INQUIRIES. IN THE MATTER OF THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION, ADM. PROC. FILE NO.  ON TUESDAY, POLICE DETAINED THE 60 MIGRANTS FOR BREACHING THE RAZOR-WIRE FENCE, THE GOVERNMENT SAID. 3-16762 (AUGUST 18, 2015). RESPONDENT BNY MELLON IS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM WHICH AT TIMES OPERATES THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES. ONE UNIT IS BNYM ASSET SERVICING. ANOTHER IS WHOLLY OWNED BNY MELLON BOUTIQUE, AN ASSET MANAGEMENT FIRM.  THOUSANDS OF ORDERS ARE TRACKED IN REAL TIME USING A PROPRIETARY ORDER MANAGEMENT PLATFORM DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED BY DART APPRAISAL. TMIDDLE EASTERN SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND BECAME A CLIENT OF BNYM ASSET SERVICING IN 2000. THE QSERVICES WERE LARGELY CUSTODIAL.  TWO YEARS LATER ASSET SERVICING ENTERED INTO AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE WEALTH FUND UNDER WHICH THE ASSETS COULD BE LOANED OUT IN ACCORD WITH CERTAIN GUIDELINES. FOLLOWING THE MARKET CRISIS, DURING WHICH THE LENDING TERMS WERE CONSTRICTED, ASSET SERVICING SOUGHT TO EXPAND THE TERMS UNDER WHICH THOSE LOANS COULD BE MADE. IN 2009 THE WEALTH FUND BECAME A CLIENT OF ASSET MANAGEMENT, DESIGNATING THE BOUTIQUE TO MANAGE ABOUT $711 MILLION IN ASSETS.  CONTINUE 0 INSIDE AMAZON AT A NEW FULFILLMENT CENTER IN NEW JERSEY, HUMANS AND ROBOTS WORK TOGETHER IN A HIGHLY EFFICIENT SYSTEM. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT THE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT COULD BE INCREASED. OFFICIALS X AND Y, BOTH SENIOR OFFICIALS CONNECTED TO THE WEALTH FUND, BEGAN SEEKING INTERNSHIPS FOR RELATIVES IN 2010. AT THE TIME BNY MELLON HAD AN ESTABLISHED SUMMER INTERNSHIP PROGRAM FOR UNDERGRADUATES. THERE WAS A SEPARATE SUMMER PROGRAM FOR POSTGRADUATES ACTIVELY PURSUING AN MBA OR SIMILAR DEGREE.  OFFICIAL X REQUESTED THAT INTERN A, HIS SON, AND INTERN B, HIS NEPHEW, BE HIRED. HE REPEATED HIS REQUEST IN A NUMBER OF EMAILS. HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS WAS MORE OF A PERSONAL REQUEST AND THAT THE WEALTH FUND WAS NOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT. INTERNALLY AT THE BANK, OFFICIAL X WAS ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE A KEY DECISION MAKER. THE REQUEST WAS GRANTED, ALTHOUGH NONE OF THE PROGRAM HIRING STANDARDS WERE FOLLOWED. BNY MELLON RETAINED THE BOUTIQUE MANDATE AND FURTHER ASSETS WERE TRANSFERRED BY OFFICIAL XS DEPARTMENT WITHIN A FEW MONTHS. OFFICIAL Y SOUGHT TO HAVE INTERN C, HIS SON, RETAINED. OFFICIAL Y WAS VIEWED AS ESSENTIAL TO OBTAINING NEW BUSINESS BY THE BANK. AT THE TIME OF THE REQUEST A NUMBER OF CLIENT SERVICE ISSUES HAD THREATENED TO WEAKEN THE RELATIONSHIP. AFTER RETAINING INTERN C, WITHOUT FOLLOWING THE USUAL HIRING PROCESS, BNY MELLON RETAINED ITS EXISTING CUSTODY AND SECURITIES LENDING BUSINESS WHICH CONTINUED TO GROW. THE INTERNSHIPS FOR INTERNS A, B AND C WERE CUSTOMIZED ONE-OF A-KIND- TRAINING PROGRAMS CRAFTED FOR THESE INTERNS.  STATES THAT IN THE LAST 2 YEARS ALONE HE HAS SEEN 3 INSTANCES OF ALUMINUM WIRING CAUSING A SUBSTANTIAL FIRE, ONE RESULTING IN THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF A HOME. THEY WERE NEITHER INEXPENSIVE NOR EASY FOR BNY MELLON TO STRUCTURE, ACCORDING TO THE ORDER. NEVERTHELESS, THE INTERNS TURNED OUT TO BE LESS THAN EXEMPLARY EMPLOYEES. BHY MELLON HAD A CODE OF CONDUCT AND A SPECIFIC FCPA POLICY. DURING THE TIME PERIOD, HOWEVER, BNY MELLON HAD FEW SPECIFIC CONTROLS RELATING TO THE HIRING OF CUSTOMERS AND RELATIVES OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ACCORDING TO THE ORDER. HERE THE SENIOR MANAGERS WERE ABLE TO APPROVE THE HIRING OF THE INTERNS WITHOUT ANY REVIEW BY PERSONS WITH LEGAL OR COMPLIANCE BACKGROUNDS. ACCORDINGLY, THE ORDER NOTES, THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS WERE DEFICIENT. THE ORDER ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF EXCHANGE ACT SECTION 30A AND SECTION 13(B)(2)(B). THE COMMISSION ACKNOWLEDGED THE COOPERATIGON OF BNY MELLON AND ITS REMEDIAL ACTS WHICH, PRIOR TO THE SECS INVESTIGATION, INCLUDED INITIATING REFORMS TO ITS ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY TO ADDRESS THE HIRING OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS RELATIVES. TO RESOLVE THE CASE RESPONDENT CONSENTOED TO THE ENTRY OF A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER BASED ON THE SECTIONS CITED IN THE ORDER. IN ADDITION, BNY MELLON AGREED TO PAY DISGORGEMENT OF $8.3 MILLION, PREJUDGMENT INTEREST AND A CIVIL MONEY PENALTY OF $5 MILLION. BNY MELLON ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A PENALTY OF OVER $5 MILLION WAS NOT IMPOSED BASED ON ITS COOPERATION.
588	THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPPED BY NEARLY THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS BETWEEN 2013 AND 2104, ACCORDING THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, FROM 13.3 TO 10.4 PERCENT. PUT ANOTHER WAY, 8.8 MILLION MORE PEOPLE WERE INSURED IN 2014 THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. THE ANNUAL STUDY FROM CENSUS IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE MEASURE OF HEALTH INSURANCE, ALTHOUGH A CHANGE IN THE WAY HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED MAKE THIS YEAR'S REPORT COMPARABLE TO 2013 BUT NOT EARLIER YEARS. CENSUS OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT A DIFFERENT ANNUAL SURVEY THAT HAS ASKED HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THIS TO BE THE BIGGEST DROP IN THE UNINSURED SINCE AT LEAST 2008. OTHERS SAY THE SIZABLE INCREASE IN AMERICANS WITH INSURANCE DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL HEALTH LAW IS UNPRECEDENTED SINCE THE CREATION OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID 50 YEARS AGO. "IT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DROP EVER," SAID PAUL FRONSTIN, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH RESEARCH AT THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WHO HAS BEEN STUDYING THE UNINSURED SINCE 1993. MORE IMPORTANTLY, SAID DIANE ROWLAND, HEAD OF THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION'S COMMISSION ON MEDICAID AND THE UNINSURED, "THE GAINS ARE EXACTLY WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WERE," MEANING THE LARGEST INCREASES IN COVERAGE WERE IN THOSE GROUPS WITH TRADITIONALLY THE HIGHEST RATES OF UNINSURANCE YOUNGER, WORKING-AGE ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH LOW AND MODERATE INCOMES. (KAISER HEALTH NEWS IS AN EDITORIALLY INDEPENDENT PROGRAM OF THE FOUNDATION.) DESPITE THE GAINS, THE CENSUS STUDY FOUND THAT 33 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT INSURANCE. WHILE THE GAINS IN INSURANCE COVERAGE WERE WIDESPREAD, THEY WEREN'T EQUAL IN EVERY CATEGORY. NOT SURPRISINGLY, AMONG TYPES OF COVERAGE, THE BIGGEST INCREASES WERE IN PEOPLE COVERED BY MEDICAID (UP 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 62 MILLION PEOPLE) AND PEOPLE BUYING THEIR OWN HEALTH PLANS (UP 3.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 14.6 MILLION PEOPLE). EXPANDING MEDICAID AND MAKING PRIVATE INSURANCE EASIER TO PURCHASE BY THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER COVERAGE WERE KEY FOCUSES OF THE HEALTH LAW. BUT THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REMAINS EMPLOYERS. THAT NUMBER HELD STEADY AT AROUND 55 PERCENT. THE UNINSURED RATE DROPPED FOR EVERY AGE, INCOME AND ETHNIC GROUP AND IN EVERY STATE, ALTHOUGH, AGAIN, SOME GAINED MORE THAN OTHERS. THOSE AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE WERE MORE LIKELY TO GAIN INSURANCE THAN THOSE WITH MORE RESOURCES. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN $25,000 PER YEAR DROPPED 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE RATE FOR THOSE WITH INCOMES BETWEEN $25,000 AND $50,000 DROPPED 5 POINTS. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR THOSE EARNING MORE THAN $100,000 ANNUALLY DROPPED TOO, BUT BY LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT. SIMILARLY, THE UNINSURED RATE FOR THE WHITE NON-HISPANIC POPULATION (THE ETHNICITY MOST LIKELY TO HAVE INSURANCE) DROPPED BY JUST OVER 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS, WHILE THE RATES FOR BLACKS, ASIAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS DROPPED BY MORE THAN 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS EACH. AMONG STATES, MASSACHUSETTS (WHICH BEGAN REQUIRING MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE INSURANCE IN 2006) HAD THE LOWEST RATE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT COVERAGE, AT 3.3 PERCENT, WHILE TEXAS CONTINUED TO LEAD THE NATION WITH THE HIGHEST UNINSURED RATE 19.1 PERCENT. STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, HOWEVER, SAW OVERALL GAINS IN INSURANCE NOT JUST MEDICAID THAT WERE LARGER THAN THOSE THAT DIDN'T. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE WITH INCOMES ABOVE POVERTY BUT LESS THAN FOUR TIMES THAT (MOST OF WHOM AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID) STILL SAW AN OVERALL DECLINE IN UNINSURANCE OF 6.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, WHILE STATES THAT DIDN'T TAKE THAT OPTION SAW THAT RATE DROP BY ONLY 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

THIS GROUP OF RARE CUTANEOUS LYMPHOMAS OF T LYMPHOCYTES HAS A POOR PROGNOSIS WITH FEW THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS AT ADVANCED STAGES. IPH4102 IS A FIRST-IN-CLASS ANTI-KIR3DL2 HUMANIZED CYTOTOXIC ANTIBODY, DESIGNED TO SELECTIVELY DEPLETE CTCL CANCER CELLS. POTENT ANTITUMOR PROPERTIES OF IPH4102 WERE SHOWN AGAINST HUMAN CTCL CELLS IN VITRO AND IN VIVO IN A MOUSE MODEL OF KIR3DL2+ TUMORS, IN WHICH IPH4102 REDUCED TUMOR GROWTH AND IMPROVED SURVIVAL. THE EFFICACY OF IPH4102 WAS FURTHER EVALUATED IN LABORATORY ASSAYS USING THE PATIENTS' OWN NATURAL KILLER (NK) CELLS AGAINST THEIR PRIMARY TUMOR SAMPLES IN PRESENCE OF IPH4102. THESE LATTER STUDIES WERE PERFORMED IN PATIENTS WITH SZARY SYNDROME, THE LEUKEMIC FORM OF CTCL WITH THE WORST PROGNOSIS. IN THESE EXPERIMENTS, IPH4102 SELECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY INDUCED KILLING OF THE PATIENTS' CTCL CELLS. THESE RESULTS WERE PUBLISHED IN CANCER RESEARCH IN 2014. A PHASE I TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO START IN 2015. IPH4102 WAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG STATUS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR THE TREATMENT OF CTCL. BIOMARKER TOOLS ARE BEING DEVELOPED IN PARALLEL TO MONITOR KIR3DL2 EXPRESSION IN PATIENTS. ABOUT INNATE PHARMA: INNATE PHARMA S.A.

590	MORE THAN HALF OF REPUBLICANS THINK OBAMA IS A MUSLIM, ACCORDING TO NEW POLL HTTP://T.CO/ZGCKINHSNA PIC.TWITTER.COM/GLKBCXMFWK MASHABLE (@MASHABLE) SEPTEMBER 1, 2015 DURING A VISIT TO HIS FATHERS NATIVE NAIROBI, KENYA THIS SUMMER, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA THUMBED HIS NOSE AT THE SO-CALLED BIRTHER MOVEMENT: PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE HE WAS NOT BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. I SUSPECT THAT SOME OF MY CRITICS BACK HOME ARE SUSPECTING THAT IM BACK HERE TO LOOK FOR MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE, HE JOKED WHILE DELIVERING A TOAST AT A STATE DINNER HOSTED BY KENYAN PRESIDENT UHURU KENYATTA . THAT IS NOT THE CASE. BUT A NEW POLL RELEASED TUESDAY CONDUCTED BY PUBLIC POLICY POLLING SHOWS THAT A LARGE SWATH OF REPUBLICANS WHO ARE REGULAR PRIMARY VOTERS ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS INDEED MUSLIM AND WAS BORN OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER DONALD TRUMPS XENOPHOBIC RHETORIC, MOST NOTABLY AGAINST MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS, IS PLAYING WELL AMONG HIS PARTYS VOTERS, WHO ALSO BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS SHOULD BE DEPORTED, THE RESULTS SHOW. DONALD TRUMPS SAYING THINGS OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK, BUT THAT HAVE GENERALLY BEEN SEEN AS NOT APPROPRIATE TO TALK ABOUT IN PUBLIC, DEAN DEBNAM , PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY POLLING SAID IN A STATEMENT (PDF). SO ITS NOT SURPRISING THAT PEOPLE WHO HOLD THOSE KINDS OF BELIEFS ARE GRAVITATING TOWARDS HIM. VIA POLL RESULTS FROM PUBLIC POLICY POLLING : 66% OF TRUMPS SUPPORTERS BELIEVE THAT OBAMA IS A MUSLIM TO JUST 12% THAT GRANT HES A CHRISTIAN. 61% THINK OBAMA WAS NOT BORN IN THE UNITED STATES TO ONLY 21% WHO ACCEPT THAT HE WAS. AND 63% WANT TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION TO ELIMINATE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP, TO ONLY 20% WHO WANT TO KEEP THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE. TRUMPS BELIEFS REPRESENT THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE GOP ELECTORATE. 51% OVERALL WANT TO ELIMINATE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP. 54% THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A MUSLIM. AND ONLY 29% GRANT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. THATS LESS THAN THE 40% WHO THINK CANADIAN BORN [TEXAS SEN.] TED CRUZ [A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE] WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES TRUMP, THE REAL ESTATE MOGUL AND REALITY TELEVISION STAR, IS AN EARLY PROPONENT OF THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT, WHICH STARTED IN 2008 WHEN THEN-ILLINOIS SENATOROBAMA MADE HIS FIRST RUN FOR PRESIDENT. WHILE RUNNING FOR HIS SECOND TERM, PRESIDENT OBAMA RELEASED HIS LONG-FORM BIRTH CERTIFICATE IN APRIL 2011, AFTER TRUMP PROPELLED SPECULATION THAT HE WAS BORN OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. BUT THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE STILL HAS NOT CONVINCED TRUMP THAT THE PRESIDENT IS A NATIVE-BORN U.S. CITIZEN, HE SAID IN JULY DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH CNNS ANDERSON COOPER . I DONT KNOW, TRUMP TOLD CNN WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE THOUGHT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE U.S. I REALLY DONT KNOW. I DONT KNOW WHY HE WOULDNT RELEASE HIS RECORDS. THE POLL RESULTS SHOW THAT TRUMPS SUPPORTERS ARENT THE ONLY ONESWHO HOLD THESE VIEWS: ONLY AMONG SUPPORTERS OF [OHIO GOV.] JOHN KASICH (58/13), [EX-FLORIDA GOV.] JEB BUSH (56/18), [NEW JERSEY GOV.] CHRIS CHRISTIE (59/33), AND [FLORIDA SEN.] MARCO RUBIO (42/30) ARE THERE MORE PEOPLE WHO THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES THAN THAT HE WASNT. BUSH, WHO WAS THE APPARENT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER BEFORE THE SUMMER OF TRUMP , HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RISE IN POPULARITY BECAUSE OF AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT PRIMARY VOTERS WHO HOLD THE SAME BELIEFS AS THOSE WHO FAVOR TRUMP, THE POLL SHOWS. SMDH. PUBLIC POLICY POLLING SAID IT SURVEYED 572 USUAL REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS AND 545 USUAL DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY VOTERS FROM AUGUST 28-30. CLICK HERE TO READ THE COMPLETE POLL RESULTS. - HILLARY CLINTON UNVEILS AMBITIOUS PLAN TO COMBAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE ON WEDNESDAY, NEW HAMPSHIRES MANCHESTER UNION LEADER PUBLISHED AN OP-ED BY DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER HILLARY CLINTON THAT OUTLINES HER POLICY PLAN TO COMBAT THE EPIDEMIC OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION: TODAY IM RELEASING A STRATEGY TO CONFRONT THE DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION CRISIS. MY PLAN SETS FIVE GOALS: EMPOWER COMMUNITIES TO PREVENT DRUG USE AMONG TEENAGERS; ENSURE EVERY PERSON SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION CAN OBTAIN COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT; ENSURE THAT ALL FIRST RESPONDERS CARRY NALOXONE, WHICH CAN STOP OVERDOSES FROM BECOMING FATAL; REQUIRE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO RECEIVE TRAINING IN RECOGNIZING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND TO CONSULT A PRESCRIPTION DRUG MONITORING PROGRAM BEFORE PRESCRIBING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES; AND PRIORITIZE TREATMENT OVER PRISON FOR LOW-LEVEL AND NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENDERS, SO WE CAN END THE ERA OF MASS INCARCERATION. ACHIEVING THESE GOALS WONT BE EASY. IT WILL TAKE COMMITMENT FROM ALL CORNERS LAW ENFORCEMENT, DOCTORS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENT AT EVERY LEVEL. THATS WHY MY PLAN STARTS BY PARTNERING WITH STATES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS AMERICA TO MEET THESE GOALS AND SUBSTANTIALLY EXPAND ACCESS TO TREATMENT. WELL ASK STATES TO DESIGN AMBITIOUS PLANS USING THE PROGRAMS THAT MAKE MOST SENSE FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES NEEDS. IN RETURN FOR STRONG PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE CRISIS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL DRAW ON A NEW $7.5 BILLION FUND TO HELP STATES MEET THEIR GOALS. CONGRATULATIONS TO CLINTON FOR ADDRESSING AND RECOGNIZING A BIG PROBLEM IN AMERICA. WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OTHER CANDIDATES ABOUT HOW THEY WILLCONTESTTHIS ISSUE. WHAT ABOUT YOU?

592	THE MAN WHO SHOT AND KILLED AKEEM BASCILLO AND HIS GIRLFRIEND JEWEL GEORGE ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT HAD BEEN FOLLOWING THEM, WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME TO STRIKE. SO SAID BASCILLOS STEPFATHER, RYAN NANLAL, WHO TOLD THE MEDIA AT THE FORENSIC SCIENCE CENTRE, ST JAMES, YESTERDAY BASCILLO, 21 AND GEORGE, 20, NOTICED A STRANGE CAR FOLLOWING AND TRIED TO HIDE OUT AT A BAR ALONG THE EASTERN MAIN ROAD TO EVADE THEIR STALKERS. WHEN THEY THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE, THEY LEFT THE BAR AND WERE WALKING ALONG THE EASTERN MAIN ROAD, NEAR THE TACARIGUA PHARMACY WEST, WHEN A GUNMAN APPROACHED THE COUPLE AND SHOT THEM BOTH IN THE HEAD. HE THEN RAN OFF. POLICE SAID THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE AROUND 9 PM. THE COUPLE FELL ON THE PAVEMENT NEXT TO EACH OTHER ON THE SIDEWALK. PHOTOS OF THE DEAD BODIES WERE CIRCULATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA MINUTES LATER, BEFORE POLICE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND CORDONED OFF THE MAIN ROAD. BASCILLOS MOTHER, NANLAL SAID, WAS ABOUT 100 FEET AWAY AND HEARD THE GUNSHOTS THAT TOOK HER CHILDS LIFE AND THAT OF HIS GIRLFRIEND AS SHE AWAITED HIS ARRIVAL AT HER HOME. NANLAL SAID THE BOYS FATHER, RICARDO DANIEL, HAD EARLIER ADVISED THE COUPLE NOT TO LEAVE HIS HUGGINS STREET, TACARIGUA, HOME AS IT WAS TOO LATE. THE COUPLE, HE SAID, WANTED TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT BEFORE GOING TO THE HOME OF BASCILLOS MOTHER WHO LIVED SOUTH OF THE PRIORITY BUS ROUTE. EARLIER THAT DAY BASCILLOS LIFE WAS THREATENED, NANLAL SAID. HE SAID SOMEONE TELEPHONED BASCILLOS COUSIN, WHO HE LIMED WITH FREQUENTLY, TO RELAY THE THREAT TO THE DISC JOCKEY. HE SAID THAT SINCE THEN BASCILLO WAS MOVING CAUTIOUSLY. HE WAS WITH THE GIRL ABOUT TWO YEARS NOW. WE NOT SURE BUT WE BELIEVE IT HAVE SOMETHING RELATING TO THE GIRL. UNDER ALL SERIOUSNESS IT WOULD BE THROUGH THE GIRL. HIS FATHER BRACE HIM WHEN THEY WERE LEAVING AND ASKED THEM WHERE THEY WERE GOING AT THIS HOUR BECAUSE THEY WERE HOME GOOD ALL THE TIME. HE (BASCILLO) SAID THEY JUST WANTED TO GO BY THE CHINESE RESTAURANT AND THEN I THINK THEY WERE GOING BY HIS MOTHER HOUSE, WHILE THEY GONE TO GET FOOD BY THE CHINESE PLACE, THEY GET KILL BY THE GUNMAN, NANLAL SAID. BASCILLOS FATHER, WHO WAS ALSO AT THE FORENSIC SCIENCE CENTRE, SAID HIS SON WAS AN INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN WHO LOVED SPORTS AND DEEJAYING. HE WASNT ANY VIOLENT PERSON. HE WAS NEVER IN DRUGS. HE DIDNT EVEN LIKE TO SMOKE CIGARETTES. ANYWHERE YOU SEE HIM HE WAS A PLEASANT PERSON AND THOSE WHO KNEW HIM THEY COULD TELL YOU, DANIEL SAID, BEFORE HE WAS CALLED AWAY BY STAFF AT THE CENTRE. NANLAL TOLD THE MEDIA BASCILLO HAD WON A COMPETITION RECENTLY WITH RADIO STATION BOOM CHAMPIONS 94.1 FM AND WAS EXPECTED TO BEGIN WORKING THERE AS PART OF HIS PRIZE. RELATIVES OF GEORGE, WHO LIVED AT MACOYA ROAD, TUNAPUNA, WERE TOO DISTRAUGHT TO SPEAK WITH THE MEDIA WHEN APPROACHED.

594	ITS BANNED BOOKS WEEK . MICHELLE LUHTALA SHARES A CROWD-SOURCED PROJECT THAT WILL HELP US PROMOTE CENSORSHIP AWARENESS AS WE POOL OUR EFFORTS TO CREATE A PROJECT WITH FAR AND LASTING REACH. MICHELLE PROPOSES THAT WE WORK TOGETHER AND CONTRIBUTE TO A CHALLENGED BOOKS SLIDE SHOW . SHE EXPLAIN EXPLAINS THE BACK STORY: THIS PROJECT BEGAN WHEN A FELLOW CONNECTICUT LIBRARIAN POSTED A QUESTION TO OUR LISTSERV COMMUNITY VIA EMAIL IN THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER. AFTER MANY YEARS IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL, IM IN A HIGH SCHOOL FOR BANNED BOOKS WEEK FOR THE FIRST TIME. ID LOVE TO HEAR SOME WAYS YOUVE CELEBRATED THIS WEEK IN YOUR HIGH SCHOOL. IM GOING TO MEETING WITH THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT ON TUESDAY TO TALK ABOUT DOING SOMETHING DURING BANNED BOOKS WEEK WITH THEIR CLASSES AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I COULD IMPRESS THEM BY COMING IN WITH A LIST OF EXCELLENT IDEAS! DAVID BILMES I EXCITEDLY REPLIED. OOH! YOU JUST INSPIRED ME TO THINK OF SOMETHING NEW. SINCE WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED WITH OUR MAKERSPACE, I MIGHT SET UP A COLLAGE TABLE WITH COLOR PRINTOUTS OF THE 100 MOST CHALLENGED BOOK COVERS, GLUE, SCISSORS, AND BUTCHER BLOCK PAPER. MAYBE THEYLL COME UP WITH SOMETHING CREATIVE WE CAN DISPLAY IN THE SCHOOL. JUST A THOUGHT AND THE MONTH FLEW BY. IVE HAD MY CRAFTS TABLE PROJECT IDEA ON MY TO DO LIST FOR THREE WEEKS, BUT IT IS NOT IN PLACE FOR TOMORROW MORNING. I DID START COLLECTING THE BOOK COVER IMAGES THOUGH. THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION (ALA)S OFFICE OF INTELLECTUAL F REEDOM IS THE BEST LIST COLLECTOR FOR BANNED BOOKS WEEK . MY FAVORITE IS THE 100 MOST FREQUENTLY CHALLENGED BOOKS FROM 2000-2009 . THERE IS A 20TH CENTURY LIST, BUT MOST OUR STUDENTS WERE BORN AFTER 2000, SO I AM NOT SURE THAT IS AS RELEVANT FOR THEM AS THE POST-2000 LIST. I FOUND THAT GOODREADS WAS THE BEST RESOURCE TO FIND IMAGES OF CONSISTENT SIZE AND QUANTITY IMAGES, SO I CREATED A LIST THERE. I STARTED A SPREADSHEET , WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO SORT AND MANIPULATE INFORMATION, BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT WAS CLASSROOM FRIENDLY. THIS POST, BY THE WAY, OFFERS A GLIMPSE INTO MY TIME MANAGEMENT ISSUES. YOU SEE? I WAS JUST GOING TO PRINT PICTURES, BUT ALREADY, I CREATED A LIST IN GOODREADS , AND AN UNFINISHED SPREADSHEET . PRINTED PICTURES? NOPE. STILL DONT HAVE THOSE. IN POPULATING THE SPREADSHEET, IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO INCLUDE THE YEAR OF PUBLICATION PAGE COUNT INTEREST LEVEL READING LEVEL LEXILE NUMBER CONTENT CONCERNS DESCRIPTION I WAS REALLY LIKING THE SPREADSHEET IDEA, BUT THAT DID NOT SOLVE MY PICTURE PROBLEM. I STILL NEEDED PRINTABLE PICTURES FOR MY MAKERSPACE IDEA. PRINTING THE GOODREADS LIST DID NOT WORK EVEN IN PDF. FOR SOME REASON, TITLES OVERLAPPED, PLUS THEY WERE TOO SMALL. SO I DECIDED TO CREATE A SLIDE SHOW, AND PRINT THAT. THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT A SLIDESHOW MIGHT BE A NICE INSTRUCTIONAL TOOL TO PASS ALONG TO OTHERS LIKE DAVID WHO SENT THE ORIGINAL LISTSERV POST, SO I ADDED PLACE HOLDERS FOR ALL THE COLUMNS ON THE SPREADSHEET NEXT TO EACH BOOK COVER IMAGE YEAR OF PUBLICATION: PAGE COUNT, INTEREST LEVEL, READING LEVEL, LEXILE NUMBER, CONTENT CONCERNS, AND DESCRIPTION. I AM STILL TRYING TO POPULATE THE SLIDESHOW , AND TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF BANNED BOOKS WEEK . IT OCCURRED TO ME ON MY WAY TO THE S CHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL LEADERSHIP SUMMIT THAT THIS WAS A PERFECT PROJECT TO CROWD SOURCE. SO . . . THIS WAS A VERY LONG-WINDED REQUEST FOR HELP. IF 20 SCHOOL LIBRARIANS TACKLE 5 SLIDES, WE CAN COLLECTIVELY KNOCK OFF THE PROJECT PRETTY QUICKLY. WE COULD HAVE THIS THING READY FOR USE IN SCHOOLS EVERYWHERE WHEN STUDENTS ARRIVE ON CAMPUS IN THE MORNING. ARE YOU IN? TIPS: THE RESOURCES ARE ON THE LAST SLIDE. YOU CAN USE THE TABLE OF CONTENTS ON SLIDE #3 TO NAVIGATE. BOOK REVIEWS. COMMON SENSE MEDIA. 2015. ACCESSED SEPTEMBER 25, 2015. HTTPS://WWW.COMMONSENSEMEDIA.ORG/BOOK-REVIEWS. IN A BANNED WEBSITES AWARENESS DAY (BWAD) WEBINAR FOR AASL LAST WEEK, A PARTICIPANT CAUTIONED ME AGAINST RECOMMENDING COMMON SENSE MEDIA CURRICULUM FOR DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP LESSONS. SHE EXPLAINED THEIR BOOK REVIEWS WERE CONSERVATIVE. I DONT SEE THEM AS CONSERVATIVE AS MUCH AS INFORMATIONAL. THEY DO FEATURE CONTENT CONCERNS, BUT I THINK THIS IS TO HELP TEACHERS AND PARENTS AVOID MAKING UNINFORMED CHOICES. IT HELPS THEM PREVIEW RESOURCES RESPONSIBLY, AND PREVIEW IS ESSENTIAL. I USED THIS RESOURCE FOR THE CONTENT CONCERNS. LUHTALA, MICHELLE. 100 MOST CHALLENGED BOOKS 2000-2009. GOODREADS. SEPTEMBER 24, 2015. ACCESSED SEPTEMBER 25, 2015.

596	A RAPID ROLL OUT OF FIBRE OPTIC BROADBAND IN UPMARKET SOUTH AFRICAN NEIGHBOURHOODS HAS CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF INTERNET VIDEO STREAMING COMPANIES WHO ARE RACING TO CAPTURE A SLICE OF A LUCRATIVE, UNTAPPED MARKET. IN SPITE OF SOUTH AFRICA BEING THE CONTINENTS MOST DEVELOPED ECONOMY AND HAVING A BURGEONING MIDDLE-CLASS, SO FAR SATELLITE TELEVISION OPERATORS DOMINATE THE HOME-VIEWING MARKET. BUT FIVE SOUTH AFRICAN VIDEO ON DEMAND (VOD) SERVICES HAVE LAUNCHED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS AND, WHEN NETFLIX ANNOUNCED GLOBAL EXPANSION PLANS IN JANUARY, IT RAISED SPECULATION THAT THE US STREAMING GIANT WOULD SOON BE COMING TO SOUTH AFRICA. AFRICAS LARGEST MOBILE OPERATOR, MTN, LAST WEEK SAID IT WOULD WAIVE DATA CHARGES FOR SUBSCRIBERS ACCESSING ITS VOD OFFERING FRONTROW. WE KNOW CONNECTIVITY IS COMING TO SOUTH AFRICA, SAID RICHARD BOORMAN, SPOKESMAN FOR THE NASPERS-OWNED VOD SERVICE SHOWMAX, LAUNCHED IN AUGUST. THE THINKING FROM OUR END IS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE INVESTING NOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BOOM IN CONNECTIVITY. AN ESTIMATED ONE MILLION SOUTH AFRICAN HOUSEHOLDS HAVE THE BANDWIDTH SPEED TO STREAM VIDEOS BUT THIS NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO SWELL IN COMING YEARS AS FIBRE OPTIC INTERNET PROVIDERS RACE TO ROLL OUT NEW SERVICES. FIXED-LINE OPERATOR TELKOM AIMS TO BRING FIBRE TO ONE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS BY NEXT YEAR, WHILE START-UP TELECOMS COMPANIES SUCH AS VUMATEL HAVE SIGNED DEALS WITH AFFLUENT SUBURBS TO SUPPLY FIBREHOODS WITH HIGH SPEED INTERNET. INSTALLING FIBRE COSTS A LITTLE MORE THAN A FIXED-LINE CONNECTION, BUT ONCE THAT COST IS COVERED IT DELIVERS DATA SPEEDS OF UP TO 20 MEGABITS PER SECOND, 10 TIMES FASTER THAN FIXED-LINE COPPER CONNECTIONS. THERES AN ALMIGHTY GOLD RUSH TO TRY AND PUT IN FIBRE AND THATS BRINGING IN THESE STREAMING SERVICES, SAID DION CHANG, DIRECTOR OF FLUX TRENDS, A TECHNOLOGY CONSULTANCY. FASTER INTERNET SPEEDS GLOBALLY ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE VOD SUBSCRIBERS TO 200 MILLION BY 2020 FROM ABOUT 83 MILLION LAST YEAR, ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PORTAL STATISTA. REUTERS

599	FOR THE SECOND INSTALLMENT OF THEIR NEW PRINT EDITION, HYPETRAK PITTED THE BEST OF THE CURRENT GENERATION IN KENDRICK LAMAR WITH THE BEST OF ALL THE OTHERS IN QUINCY JONES FOR A LEGENDARY SITDOWN. NATURALLY, THE SCRIBE BEHIND TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY KNOWS THE 27-TIME GRAMMY WINNER FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS FOR MICHAEL JACKSONS THRILLER AND JONES, NOW 82, ISNT TOO SHABBY ABOUT STAYING UP ON THE HAPPENINGS OF TODAYS CULTURE , EITHER. HERES AN EXCERPT FROM THEIR SITDOWN: LIKE THE YOUNG WARRIOR, KENDRICK HAS SET ABOUT ON HIS OWN EXPEDITION THIS SUMMER, PERFORMING TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY AROUND THE WORLD; AN ALBUM THAT RECEIVED CRITICAL ACCLAIM FOR ITS RADICALLY INTROSPECTIVE LYRICS, AND A FUSION OF HIP-HOP, JAZZ, AND BLUES THAT QUINCY PIONEERED DURING THE EARLY 90S WITH ALBUMS BACK ON THE BLOCK AND QS JOOK JOINT. HOWEVER, JUST AS TPABS OUTRO MORTAL MAN ASSERTS, THIS HAS BEEN MORE THAN A PROMOTIONAL TOUR TO TURN HIS GOLD RECORD INTO PLATINUM. COMPTONS NATIVE SON IS LEADING AN ARMY INTO A BATTLE FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. HIS LYRICS HAVE BECOME A VOICE FOR BLACK AMERICAS YOUTH, AS THE THIN VEIL OF PRIVILEGE, WEALTH AND POLITICS CAN NO LONGER CONCEAL THEIR DAILY PERSECUTION FROM THE PREVIOUSLY IGNORANT. AFTER PROVIDING A BRIEF BUT VIVID ACCOUNT OF HIS ARDUOUS CHILDHOOD, THE 82-YEAR-OLD MUSICIAN-TURNED-MULTIMILLIONAIRE ENTREPRENEUR MOVES TO THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR TO ADD, THE HOOD IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD. AS HIS WORDS LINGER, LEAVING KENDRICK ANTICIPATING HIS NEXT PIECE OF ADVICE, YOU CAN HEAR A HINT OF FATIGUE ECHOING FROM QUINCYS VOICE, AND RIGHTFULLY SO. ALTHOUGH THE DECADES OF SOCIAL ACTIVISM, FROM WORKING WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. TO NELSON MANDELA, MAY HAVE HAD ITS TOLL ON JONES AND HIS WELL-KNOWN JOYOUS SPIRIT, ITS LIKELY MORE INDICATIVE OF THE UPHILL BATTLE THAT CONSTANTLY AWAITS HIS PEOPLE. LISTING THE PLACES HES BEEN, THE LANGUAGES HES LEARNED, AND THE CULTURES HES STUDIED, QUINCY URGES HIS MUSICAL OFFSPRING TO DO THE SAME AND EXPERIENCE IT FOR HIMSELF. ITS SO EDUCATIONAL THE FOOD, THE MUSIC, THE LANGUAGE. SIMILAR TO LAMAR, A YOUNG JONES ALSO WENT ON AN INTERNATIONAL TOUR AMID A VERY RACIALLY CHARGED TIME IN AMERICA. IN 1952, SHORTLY AFTER PLAYING AT SEATTLE CLUBS WITH CLOSE FRIEND RAY CHARLES AND THEN DROPPING OUT OF WHAT IS NOW THE ESTEEMED BERKLEE COLLEGE OF MUSIC IN BOSTON, A 19-YEAR-OLD QUINCY WAS HIRED TO PLAY TRUMPET FOR JAZZ VIBRAPHONIST LIONEL HAMPTON ON A EUROPEAN TOUR.

601	CATERHAM PHOTOGRAPHER 'CHASING THE PERFECT PICTURE' TALKS ABOUT HER CAREER CAPTURING ARTISTS ON TOUR 16:48, 22 SEP 2015 UPDATED 16:49, 22 SEP 2015 BY AMANIHUGHES, CHRISTIE GOODWIN HAS BEEN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS SINCE THE AGE OF 12 AND HAS BUILT UP AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY CAPTURING TOP RECORDING ARTISTS ON TOUR VIEW GALLERY FROM THE LIKES OF KATY PERRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND ONE DIRECTION, THIS PHOTOGRAPHER FROM CATERHAM HAS CAPTURED A HEAP OF FAMOUS NAMES AND IS CONTINUING HER SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT PICTURE. CHRISTIE GOODWIN, A BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHER, WHOSE CAREER SPANS MORE THAN 35 YEARS, STARTED TAKING PICTURES AT THE AGE OF 12 AND WAS BOUGHT HER FIRST CAMERA AT 13. SHE GRADUATED FROM THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS IN ANTWERP AND GOT HER FIRST JOB IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY, EVOLVING TOWARDS EDITORIAL AND WORKING FOR NEWS AGENCIES BEFORE ENDING UP IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND TAKING PICTURES OF ARTISTS ON TOUR. CHRISTIE'S PORTFOLIO IS A WHO'S WHO OF TOP NAMES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, INCLUDING KATY PERRY, ED SHEERAN, USHER, TAYLOR SWIFT, ONE DIRECTION, SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY AND KYLIE MINOGUE, AMONG MANY OTHERS. SHE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME ON TOUR CAPTURING IMAGES OF ARTISTS WHICH APPEAR ON CDS, DVDS, TOUR MERCHANDISE, POSTERS, INTERNATIONAL PUBLICATIONS, BOOKS AND EXHIBITIONS. EVEN THOUGH CHRISTIE HAS BEEN ON TOUR WITH MANY ARTISTS SHE ADMITTED SHE IS STILL ON THE HUNT FOR THE ELUSIVE PERFECT PICTURE. THE THING I HAVE BEEN CHASING IS THE PERFECT PICTURE, IT KEEPS ME GOING, TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT, CHRISTIE SAID. PHOTOGRAPHY IS BASICALLY ONE MOMENT IN TIME AND YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL TO OTHERS, THAT'S WHY YOU CAPTURE IT, TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE WHAT YOU FELT AND WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED. I WANT TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT IN TIME, IF I SHOOT A SHOW I WANT THE VIEWER TO FEEL LIKE THEY WERE THERE, THAT WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT A PICTURE THEY FEEL THE MUSIC AND FEEL THE CROWD. THAT'S WHAT I AIM FOR IN MY PHOTOGRAPHY. @CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE EXPLAINED OUT OF ALL THE TOURS SHE HAS CAPTURED, KATY PERRY'S PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR WAS THE MOST EXCITING. I STARTED DOING THE REHEARSALS SO I ACTUALLY SAW THE SHOW BUILD UP TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE END, I SPEND TWO TO THREE WEEKS ON THE SHOW. IT WAS REALLY EXCITING TO SEE HOW SOMETHING COMES TO LIFE. THROUGHOUT HER ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER CHRISTIE HAS CAPTURED SOME POWERFUL IMAGES, FROM BB KING AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL TO SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY STRUMMING A GUITAR. HOWEVER SHE EXPLAINED HER FAVOURITE MOMENT TAKEN SO FAR WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF KATY PERRY DURING HER PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR. AN IMAGE WHICH IS NOW ICONIC AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD TO PUBLICISE THE TOUR. IN THE SHOW IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE FIREWORKS WERE BEHIND HER, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN, CHRISTIE SAID. THE MOMENT THE FIREWORKS GO, YOU GET TO SHOOT THREE FRAMES, SHE DIDN'T HAVE HER HEAD AROUND, THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE FIREWORKS. THAT FRAME HAS MADE HISTORY AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD, IT WAS A LUCKY SHOT AND I WAS HAPPY THAT WE GOT IT. ALWAYS ON THE MOVE EVEN THOUGH PHOTOGRAPHING FAMOUS ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS SOUNDS EXCITING AND CONSTANTLY DIFFERENT, CHRISTIE ASSURED IT WAS NOT ALWAYS GLAMOROUS, AS YOU ARE ALWAYS ON THE MOVE AND NEVER IN ONE PLACE FOR VERY LONG. WHEN YOU DO NOT TRAVEL, IT'S VERY EXCITING BUT WHEN YOU TRAVEL ALL THE TIME, LITTLE THINGS START TO BOTHER YOU, YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR LAUNDRY AND YOU ARE NOT IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG TIME, IT'S A DRAG. HOWEVER IN CONTRAST TO THIS CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE EASILY GETS BORED AND ITCHY FEET WHEN SHE COMES HOME TO CATERHAM AND IS EAGER TO GET OFF TO HER NEXT DESTINATION AND NEXT TOUR. THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS I DO ENJOY, YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES, SLEEP IN YOUR OWN BED, BUT AFTER THREE DAYS I WANT TO GO AGAIN, I GET BORED. WHEN I AM ON THE ROAD, I WANT TO BE BACK AT HOME AND WHEN I'M HOME I WANT TO BE ON THE ROAD. I CANNOT LIVE AT HOME, I WOULD GET BORED, BUT YOU ALSO CANNOT BE ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME, I NEED A COMBINATION OF THE TWO. WHEN ASKED IF SHE COULD IMAGINE HER LIFE TAKING A DIFFERENT PATH, CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED DOING ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN PHOTOGRAPHY. I COULD NOT BE ANYTHING ELSE, WHEN I PICK UP A CAMERA, IT'S JUST ME AND THE CAMERA, IT'S PART OF ME, IT'S WHO I AM, I CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT THE CAMERA. TAKE PHOTOS LIKE A PRO CHRISTIE HAS TEAMED UP WITH CURRYS PC WORLD TO HELP MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR CAMERA EQUIPMENT AND PROVIDES HER TOP TIPS ON HOW TO CAPTURE PHOTOGRAPHS AT FESTIVALS, FROM TAKING THE PERFECT FESTIVAL SELFIE, LOOKING TO NAVIGATE OBSTRUCTIVE CROWDS OR CAPTURING FAST-MOVING STAGE ACTION. PLAN AHEAD: LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE, KNOW WHICH ARTISTS YOU WANT TO SHOOT, AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT IF YOU WISH TO PHOTOGRAPH BANDS ON DIFFERENT STAGES, YOU NEED TO GET THERE IN TIME. ALSO PREPARE FOR THE FACT THAT THEY MIGHT NOT START EXACTLY WHEN THEYRE SUPPOSED TO. I ALWAYS CARRY MY OWN FESTIVAL SCHEDULE ON MY PHONE. SHOOTING MY FIRST BIG FESTIVAL EARLY ON IN MY CAREER, I NEARLY MISSED AC/DC, BECAUSE I WASNT PREPARED! BE PREPARED: MAKE SURE YOU BRING ENOUGH MEMORY CARDS AND BATTERY POWER TO LAST ALL THE WAY. CHANCES ARE YOU WONT HAVE ANYWHERE TO CHARGE THEM FOR HOURS AND YOU DONT WANT TO RUN OUT JUST BEFORE YOUR FAVOURITE BAND IS ON. KEEP THEM IN A LITTLE POUCH WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES AND MAKE SURE ITS WATERPROOF, SO YOU DONT BECOME VICTIM TO FAILING CAMERA EQUIPMENT. COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS: FESTIVAL STAGES CAN BE QUITE MESSY AND CLUTTERY, SO TAKE THE TIME TO COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS. LOOK FOR ANGLES WHERE YOU CAN AVOID PEOPLE OR OBJECTS THAT WILL MAKE THE PHOTO LOOK A MESS. FESTIVAL STAGES CAN ALSO BE VERY HIGH, ESPECIALLY THE MAIN STAGE, SO IT CAN EVEN BE A CHALLENGE FOR US PROS IN THE PHOTO PIT IN FRONT OF THE STAGE. BUT MAKE SURE YOU WAIT FOR THOSE MOMENTS WHEN YOUR FAVOURITE SINGER IS RIGHT AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE THATS WHERE YOU GET YOUR BEST SHOTS. REMEMBER THE CROWD: SOME OF MY BEST SHOTS ARE NOT OF THE ARTISTS BUT OF PEOPLE IN THE CROWD. THE CROWD OFTEN MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE AND CAN BRING TO LIFE THAT FEELING YOU GET BEING AT A FESTIVAL. THE GO PRO HERO 4 OR EE 4GEE ACTION CAM ARE GREAT FOR THIS KIND OF SHOT DUE TO THEIR ULTRA-WIDE ANGLE LENSES FOR A UNIQUE CROWD VIEW. WHEN YOU DO THIS, TRY TO HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER OR EVEN LOWER, PLAY WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES. MAKE SURE TO ALSO TAKE AT LEAST ONE LONG WALK AROUND THE WHOLE FESTIVAL GROUND TO HELP YOU FIND THE PERFECT SUBJECTS. MIND THE RAIN: FESTIVALS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR EVER-CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS. PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEOPLE IN THE MUD ARE TOKEN FESTIVAL SHOTS. HAVING RAIN VISIBLE IN THE SHOT CAN ADD SOMETHING INTERESTING, SO DONT TAKE IT AS A BAD THING. I NEVER GO TO A FESTIVAL WITHOUT A PLASTIC BAG TO PROTECT MY GEAR, AND HAVING A WATERPROOF CASE OR AN ACTUAL WATERPROOF CAMERA LIKE THE FUJIFILM XP80 CAN HELP TO CATER FOR ANY WEATHER CHANGE. CONSIDER YOUR LENSES: CHANGING LENSES IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD CAN BE A NIGHTMARE. DUST, MUD, THE BOOTS OF A CROWDSURFER AND AN AIRBOURNE CUP OF BEER HAVE A WAY OF FINDING YOU THE TIME YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LENS. PRACTICE CHANGING THE LENS UNDER A PLASTIC BAG OR UNDER YOUR JACKET. BECOME A FESTIVAL SELFIE KING OR QUEEN: IF YOURE GOING TO TAKE A SELFIE, MAKE SURE THE SELFIE TELLS A STORY. YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE OF YOURSELF, OR YOU CAN TAKE A FEW EXTRA SECONDS AND FRAME THAT SELFIE A LITTLE BETTER, GET SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THE SHOT, OR SOMETHING ANNOYING OUT OF IT. TAKE YOUR TIME, LOOK AROUND, AND MAYBE HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER SO THAT YOU HAVE THE WHOLE FESTIVAL IN THE BACKGROUND. IF YOU TAKE A LOT OF SELFIES, THE COMPACT PANASONIC TZ57 HAS A SELFIE SCREEN AND WI-FI SO YOU CAN POST IT ON THE WEB IMMEDIATELY. THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT: WHEN YOU TAKE PHOTOS OF YOUR FRIENDS, OR WHEN YOU TAKE SELFIES, TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT. IF THE SUN IS BEHIND THE PERSON IN THE PHOTO, THEIR FACE WILL BE DARKER. ITS NOT A BAD IDEA TO USE A FLASH IF YOURE SHOOTING AGAINST THE LIGHT, EVEN ON A SUNNY DAY. OR DO THE OPPOSITE, SHOOT AGAINST THE LIGHT AND PLAY WITH DARK SILHOUETTES. YOU DONT NEED A PRO CAMERA TO GET AN AMAZING SHOT LIKE THAT. TAKE IN THE VIEW: IT CAN BE REALLY FUN TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT LENSES. A FISH-EYE OR WIDE-ANGLE LENS CAN REALLY HELP CAPTURE THE SCALE OF THE FESTIVAL. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE FUN. A FISH-EYE IS A PRIME LENS, MEANING THAT YOU CANT ZOOM IN OR OUT WITH IT. THEREFORE, ITS UP TO YOU TO ACT AS THE ZOOM FOR THE LENS. BE SURE TO CHANGE PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES AND LINES. GET DOWN LOW TO THE GROUND, EVEN IF IT MEANS LAYING ON YOUR STOMACH IN WHATS LEFT OF THE FESTIVAL GRASS. LEAN UP AGAINST A WALL AND USE THE DISTORTION OF THE LENS TO WRAP THE WALL AROUND THE FRAME. JUST HAVE FUN! BE AWARE THAT IF YOU FRAME A CLOSE UP OF A PERSON NEAR THE OUTER EDGES OF A WIDE ANGLE OR FISH-EYE SHOT, THEIR FACE CAN BE STRETCHED OUT. KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT: THIS ONE IS CRUCIAL. GETTING A NEW CAMERA WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT FEATURES IS TEMPTING, BUT MAKE SURE YOU LEARN HOW TO USE THEM. WALK THROUGH THE MANUAL GUIDE AND TEST IT ALL OUT. IT MIGHT SEEM A BIT TEDIOUS TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE STEPS BUT EVEN THE PRO PHOTOGRAPHER TAKES HIS TIME TO LEARN TO KNOW THEIR CAMERA. ONCE YOU KNOW ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF YOUR CAMERA AND HOW TO USE THEM THEN THERE IS NOTHING STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND THAT PERFECT SHOT. CHRISTIE ADDED TO TAKE MANY PHOTOS, AS IT IS THE VOLUME THAT MATTERS AND GET TO KNOW YOUR CAMERA. DO NOT SHOOT ON THE AUTOMATIC, PUT YOUR CAMERA ON MANUAL AND TEST IT OUT, YOU CANNOT LET THE CAMERA THINK FOR YOU, YOU HAVE TO THINK FOR THE CAMERA AND SHOOT WHAT YOU WANT.

INDIAN PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI (L) AND FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG ATTEND A TOWNHALL MEETING, AT FACEBOOK HEADQUARTERS IN MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA, ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2015 AN INVITATION-ONLY AUDIENCE JUMPED TO ITS FEET, CHEERING AND SNAPPING PHOTOS AS MODI STRODE INTO A SUN-SPLASHED COURTYARD WITH ZUCKERBERG -- SPORTING A JACKET AND TIE FOR THE OCCASION, IN A SARTORIAL ABOUT-FACE FOR THE TYPICALLY CASUAL CAMPUS. "TO LEADERS ALL OVER THE WORLD; YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GAIN BY RUNNING AWAY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA," SAID THE TECH-SAVVY PREMIER DURING A TOWN HALL-STYLE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION. "THE STRENGTH OF SOCIAL MEDIA TODAY IS THAT IT CAN TELL GOVERNMENTS WHERE THEY ARE GOING WRONG AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A COURSE CORRECTION." "YOU WILL GAIN FROM JOINING IT. YOU NEED REAL TIME INFORMATION," SAID THE 65-YEAR-OLD MODI, WHO HAS 30 MILLION FANS ON FACEBOOK AND TWEETS MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY. MODI USED THE SESSION, WHICH LASTED ALMOST AN HOUR AND WAS STREAMED ONLINE, TO PROMOTE HIS DIGITAL INDIA DRIVE AND PROMOTE THE COUNTRY AS A PLACE WORTHY OF TOURISTS, INVESTMENTS, AND ENTREPRENEURS WITH VISIONS OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY START-UPS. ZUCKERBERG OPENED BY TELLING OF A TIME, ABOUT A DECADE AGO, WHEN FACEBOOK WAS GOING THROUGH A "ROUGH PATCH" AND THERE WERE THOUGHTS OF SELLING THE STARTUP. HE SAID HE VISITED ONE OF HIS MENTORS, LATE APPLE CO-FOUNDER STEVE JOBS, WHO TOLD HIM TO VISIT A CERTAIN TEMPLE IN INDIA THAT HE VISITED DURING APPLE'S EARLY DAYS. "I WENT, AND TRAVELLED FOR ALMOST A MONTH," ZUCKERBERG RECOUNTED. "SEEING THE PEOPLE AND HOW PEOPLE CONNECTED, REINFORCED WHAT WE WERE DOING AND IS SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS REMEMBERED." MODI'S STOP AT FACEBOOK WAS PART OF A TOUR OF SILICON VALLEY. IT IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1982 THAT A PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA HAS VISITED THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES. MODI LEFT FACEBOOK TO VISIT GOOGLE'S MAIN CAMPUS IN NEARBY MOUNTAIN VIEW. HE WAS LATER TO STAR AT AN EVENT ATTENDED BY SOME 18,000 PEOPLE IN A CONVENTION CENTER IN THE CITY OF SAN JOSE IN SILICON VALLEY.
603	DRIVE TO THE GROCERY STORE, WATER YOUR PLANTS. THE 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI IS THE JAPANESE AUTOMAKERS FIRST PRODUCTION HYDROGEN FUEL CELL SEDAN AND IS CLOSE TO BEING LAUNCHED IN CALIFORNIA. THE MIRAI, ALONG WITH THE HYUNDAI TUCSON AND HONDA FCV, ARE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES (FCEV) THAT USES COMPRESSED HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IN A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT CREATES ELECTRICITY TO POWER A COMPACT MOTOR, WHICH IN TURN DRIVES THE FRONT WHEELS. THE ONLY EMISSION IS WATER VAPOR. THE TOYOTA MIRAI PROMISES A 312-MILE RANGE BETWEEN HYDROGEN FILL-UPS, ROOM FOR FOUR PASSENGERS AND A REFUELING TIME OF THREE TO FOUR MINUTES (H70/700 BAR). UNLIKE A PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE, THERES NO WAITING HOURS FOR THE BATTERY TO RECHARGE. WITH A TOP SPEED OF 111 MPH AND ZERO-TO-60 MPH TIMES OF LESS THAN 10 SECONDS, PERFORMANCE IS SIMILAR TO AN EV SUCH AS THE NISSAN LEAF AND VW E-GOLF. A LITTLE LARGER THAN ITS HYBRID COUSINS, THE PRIUS AND CT 200H, THE MIRAI IS BUILT ON A PLATFORM THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY USED BY THE RETIRED LEXUS HS 250H. SIZE MATTERS AND EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE PROPULSION SYSTEM, BATTERY, AND TWO LIGHTWEIGHT CARBON FIBER REINFORCED PLASTIC, HIGH-PRESSURE HYDROGEN TANKS HAD TO FIT. MANY COMPONENTS OF THE ELECTRIC-DRIVE SYSTEM ARE SHARED WITH TOYOTAS HYBRID DRIVETRAIN WITH THE BENEFIT OF KEEPING BUILD COSTS DOWN. DRIVING IMPRESSIONS PROMISING A PUNCH OF 152 HORSEPOWER AND 247 LB-FT OF TORQUE, THE ENGINE FEELS REASONABLY STRONG AND ALSO HAS A POWER MODE THAT RELEASES MORE HYDROGEN INTO THE FUEL CELL STACK. EVEN THOUGH IT SHARES ELECTRIC POWERTRAIN BITS FROM THE PRIUS, THE MIRAI IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN ITS HYBRID COUSIN. CABIN MATERIALS ARE NICER THAN A PRIUS AND IT HAS MANY PREMIUM FEATURES THAT YOU WONT FIND IN A PRIUS. PLUS, THIS IS A HEAVIER CAR THAT WEIGHS 1,006 POUNDS MORE THAN A REGULAR PRIUS, AND YOU FEEL THE EXTRA WEIGHT PUSHING THE CAR INTO CORNERS. REALISTICALLY, THE MIRAI HAS PLENTY OF PEP FOR A CAR WHERE PERFORMANCE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A SELLING POINT. MASHING THE THROTTLE TO THE FLOOR FROM A DEAD- OR ROLLING-STOP INVIGORATES THE MIRAI WITH INSTANTANEOUS TORQUE RESPONSE FROM THE ELECTRIC MOTOR. TRYING TO COAX MORE ACCELERATION FOR PASSING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IS A SLOW AND STEADY PROCESS A BEHAVIOR THAT IS TYPICAL WITH HYBRIDS AND EVS. TOYOTA THINKS MOST BUYERS OF THE MIRAI WILL BE MORE APPRECIATIVE OF THE SMOOTH, COMFORTABLE RIDE OVER A SPORTY EDGE. I DROVE THE 2016 MIRAI FOR A DAY AND INTO THE NIGHT, AND LOGGED 262 MILES. AT THE END OF MY TEST DRIVE THE MIRAI REPORTED A MILES PER GALLON EQUIVALENCY (MPGE) OF 60 COMPARED TO THE FACTORY SPEC OF 67 MPGE. THIS WAS MY SECOND TIME BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE MIRAI THE FIRST EXPERIENCE WAS LIMITED TO A 5 MINUTE TEST DRIVE AROUND THE BLOCK AND A DISTANCE LESS THAN TWO MILES. THIS TIME I HAD THE FULL EXPERIENCE AND DROVE IT FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, TO SACRAMENTO, THEN TO THE EAST BAY FOR MORE DRIVING TIME AT NIGHT. I WAS EXPECTING THE MIRAI TO DRIVE SIMILAR TO AN EV, BUT HAD A TOTAL CHANGE IN ATTITUDE BY THE TIME I WAS READY TO RETURN THE KEY TO TOYOTA. THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS ZERO-EMISSION CAR, AND VERY FEW THAT ARENT SO GOOD. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT I APPRECIATED WAS THE HUSH TONE OF THE CABIN AND ITS ABILITY TO INSULATE THE PASSENGERS FROM ROAD NOISE. THE COMBINATION OF ACOUSTIC GLASS, SOUND ABSORBING MATERIALS, AND SOUND-INSULATING MATERIALS PLACED INSIDE THE BODY FRAME WORK TOGETHERREDUCING NOISE AND VIBRATIONS; THE CARPETS ARE FITTED WITHOUT ANY GAPS AND THERE ARE LOTS OF SOFT-TOUCH SURFACES THAT ABSORB SOUND. EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER RESULTING IN A QUIET, REFINED TRIP THAT IS ON PAR WITH A LEXUS ES OR GS. THE STEERING RESPONSE HAS A LIGHT FEEL AND SOMEWHAT NUMB, BUT OVERALL IT IS GOOD FOR BEING ELECTRIC POWER ASSISTED. HANDLING AND RIDE QUALITY IS EVEN BETTER. THERE IS MINIMAL BODY LEAN CARVING THROUGH THE CORNERS AND THE RIDE QUALITY, WHICH FEELS ON THE FIRM SIDE, IS NOT BUMPY OR HARSH FEELING. THE 4,078 POUND CURB WEIGHT PROBABLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE SMOOTH, PLUSH RIDE. THE SEATS ARE INJECTION-MOLDED AND COVERED IN A PSUEDO-LEATHER MATERIAL CALLED SOFTEX, WHILE COMFORTABLE AND CONFORMING, THE MATERIAL ISNT NICE TO TOUCH. I HAVE A SMALL BODY FRAME AND DID NOT NOTICE MYSELF SQUIRMING IN THE SEAT TO FIND A COMFORTABLE SPOT, NOR WAS I SLIDING AROUND WHEN TESTING THE CORNERING CAPABILITIES. THE FRONT AND REAR SEATS ARE HEATED, BUT NEITHER SETUP WITH FANS UNDERNEATH FOR COOLING. THE CABIN DESIGN HAS A SCULPTED DASHBOARD AND AN INFORMATION DISPLAY MOUNTED HIGH AND CENTERED. SCROLLING THROUGH THE MULTITUDE OF DISPLAY SCREENS REPORT INFORMATION ON ENERGY USAGE, MPGE DIARY, HOW GOOD (OR POORLY) YOUR DRIVING STYLE HAS AFFECTED FUEL CONSUMPTION, AND MORE. NAVIGATION, INFOTAINMENT AND CLIMATE CONTROLS ARE ACCESSIBLE ON ANOTHER PANEL BELOW THE CENTRAL DISPLAY SCREENS. THE ELECTROSTATIC TOUCHSCREEN SWITCHES ARE MODERN AND ATTRACTIVE, BUT GETS MESSY WITH FINGERPRINTS AND SMUDGES EASILY. THE MIRAI IS WELL EQUIPPED WITH LED HEADLAMPS, HEATED STEERING WHEEL, INDIVIDUAL AUTOMATIC CLIMATE CONTROL FOR THE FRONT PASSENGERS, AND ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL. BACK SEAT PASSENGERS HAVE HEATED SEATS AND PLENTY OF LEGROOM. BECAUSE THE REAR SEATS SIT ABOVE THE HYDROGEN TANKS, HEADROOM IS LIMITED. MIRAI ALSO HAS A BROAD RANGE OF STANDARD ONBOARD SAFETY TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING VEHICLE PRE-COLLISION, BLIND SPOT MONITOR, LANE DEPARTURE ALERT, DRIVE START CONTROL AND AUTOMATIC HIGH BEAMS. BEGINNING FALL 2015, THE MIRAI IS ONLY GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS WHOSE APPLICATION IS ACCEPTED BY TOYOTA. INITIALLY, EIGHT DEALERSHIPS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO SELL 700 UNITS OF THE HYDROGEN FUEL-CELL CAR, BUT THE PROGRAM WILL EXPAND UP TO 2,000 UNITS NEXT YEAR AND EVENTUALLY BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE NORTHEAST STATES OF CONNECTICUT, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, AND RHODE ISLAND. EARLY ADOPTERS BEWARE THE COST TO OWN A 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI OUTRIGHT IS $58,325, OR LEASE IT FOR $499 A MONTH FOR 36 MONTHS WITH $3,649 DUE AT SIGNING. IF YOU CHOOSE TO PURCHASE A MIRAI, THERE ARE FEDERAL AND STATE INCENTIVES AVAILABLE, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE PRICE BY AS MUCH AS $13,000. THE PURCHASE PRICE INCLUDES THREE YEARS OR $15,000 WORTH OF FREE HYDROGEN FUEL FOR THE CAR; A WEEKS WORTH OF RENTAL-CAR ACCESS FOR THE FIRST THREE YEAR; A HYDROGEN FUEL STATION FINDER APP; 24/7 CUSTOMER SUPPORT; AND AN EIGHT-YEAR, 100,000-MILE HYDROGEN POWERTRAIN WARRANTY. ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES ARE ALLOWED ACCESS TO CALIFORNIAS HIGH OCCUPANCY (HOV) LANES, WHICH IS A GOOD PERK IF YOURE COMMUTING ALONE. LOCATING A REFUELING STATION WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR EARLY ADOPTERS, MUCH LIKE TRYING TO FIND AN EV CHARGING STATION A FEW YEARS AGO. CALIFORNIA HAS PLANS TO OPEN 56 HYDROGEN REFUELING STATIONS IN SELECT AREAS UP THROUGH AUTUMN 2016, OF WHICH EIGHT ARE OFFICIALLY OPEN NOW. CHECK THE CALIFORNIA FUEL CELL PARTNERSHIP (WWW.CAFCP.ORG) WEBSITE FOR MAPS AND CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLANNED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AND THE PROGRAMS PROGRESS. THE WEBSITE IS ALSO A GOOD SOURCE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE COLLABORATION THAT IS HAPPENING WITH INVOLVED GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AUTOMAKERS, AND ENERGY PROVIDERS. USING THE TFL CAR SCALE OF BUY IT! LEASE IT! RENT IT! OR FORGET IT! THE MIRAI GETS EARNS A LEASE IT! FOR ITS ADVANCED ENGINEERING, NEAR-LUXURY RIDE AND COMFORT, AND BETTER THAN AVERAGE RIDE QUALITY. IT LOSES POINTS FOR ITS EXPENSIVE ENTRY PRICE, LACK OF FEEDBACK THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL, AND THE TOUCH QUALITY OF THE SEAT MATERIAL AND PANEL SWITCHES. PLUS, ITS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO BE TIED TO EVOLVING AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGIES SHORT-TERM. WHILE THE MIRAI LEADS US DOWN THE PATH OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND ZERO EMISSIONS, AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS SIMPLY A CAR THAT DOES ITS JOB WELL AND HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF PROVIDING WATER FOR YOUR PLANTS. 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI SPECS: TYPE: POLYMER ELECTROLYTE FUEL CELL MAX.

604	- AS PART OF THE NSW GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSED REFORMS TO STRATA LAWS, A NEW SYSTEM ON RECTIFYING BUILDING DEFECTS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED TO PROTECT UNIT AND HOME OWNERS. UNDER THE STRATA SCHEMES MANAGEMENT BILL 2015, DEVELOPERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO: 1. HAVE THE BUILDING WORK INSPECTED BY A BUILDING INSPECTOR; AND 2. LODGE A BUILDING BOND A SECURITY FOR BUILDING DEFECTS. THE RATE OF THE BOND IS AT 2 PERCENT OF THE CONTRACT PRICE FOR THE BUILDING WORK. THE DRAFT BILL, ACCORDING TO MINISTER FOR INNOVATION AND BETTER REGULATION VICTOR DOMINELLO, AIMS TO GUARANTEE OWNERS THAT BUILDING DEFECTS APPEARING IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS WILL BE FIXED OTHER THAN TAKING IT TO THE COURT. THE PROPOSED REFORMS WILL AFFECT DEVELOPERS OF STRATA BUILDINGS GREATER THAN THREE STOREYS HIGH IN NEW SOUTH WALES. THE BILL COVERS ALL RESIDENTIAL BUILDING WORKS THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM THE HOME BUILDING COMPENSATION INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE HOME BUILDING ACT 1989 OR BUILDINGS USED FOR MIXED USE PURPOSES THAT INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES. COMMON DEFECTS IDENTIFIED INCLUDED SHIFTING FOUNDATIONS, WALL CRACKS AND TILING FAULTS. INSPECTION REPORTS THE DRAFT BILL REQUIRES THE DEVELOPER TO HAVE THE BUILDING WORK INSPECTED BY A BUILDING INSPECTOR APPROVED BY THE OWNER CORPORATION. BUILDING INSPECTORS MUST BE APPOINTED NOT LATER THAN 12 MONTHS AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE WORK. IF THE DEVELOPER AND OWNER CORPORATION DO NOT AGREE WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF BUILDING INSPECTOR, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE OFFICE OF FINANCE AND SERVICES WILL ARRANGE THE APPOINTMENT. AN INTERIM REPORT PREPARED BY THE BUILDING INSPECTORS MUST BE PROVIDED NOT LATER THAN 18 MONTHS AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE WORK TO THE DEVELOPER AND OWNER CORPORATION. THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE MUST ARRANGE A FINAL INSPECTION NOT LATER THAN 2 YEARS AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE WORK. THE DEVELOPER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE EXPENSES THAT WILL INCUR TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUIREMENT. BUILDING BONDS THE DRAFT BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE DEVELOPER TO LODGE A BUILDING BOND AS A SECURITY TO FIX ANY DEFECTIVE WORK IDENTIFIED IN THE FINAL INSPECTION OF THE BUILDING INSPECTORS. THE BUILDING BOND IS IN THE AMOUNT OF 2 PER CENT OF THE CONTRACT PRICE FOR THE BUILDING WORK. THE BALANCE THEREOF OR THE WHOLE BUILDING BOND, IF NO DEFECTS ARE REPORTED, MUST BE PAID OUT OR REFUNDED TO THE DEVELOPER 2 YEARS AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE BUILDING WORK OR WITHIN 60 DAYS OF THE FINAL INSPECTION REPORT GIVEN TO THE DEVELOPER, WHICHEVER OCCURS LATER. THE BILL IS SCHEDULED TO BE INTRODUCED TO THE PARLIAMENT IN OCTOBER AND IS EXPECTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN 2016.

605	THE WESTERN CAPE HIGH COURT HAS PUT THE BRAKES ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL ROADS AGENCYS (SANRALS) PLAN TO TOLL SEGMENTS OF THE N1 AND N2 IN THE PROVINCE, DEALING THE PARASTATAL A MAJOR BLOW. ON WEDNESDAY, THE COURT SET ASIDE THE PLAN IN A JUDGMENT LIKELY TO EMBOLDEN OPPONENTS OF THE AGENCYS GAUTENG E-TOLLS. THE COURT ALSO ORDERED SANRAL TO REVIEW ITS PLANS FOR THE HIGHWAYS. IN ADDITION, THE COURT SAID IF SANRAL WANTED TO PROCEED WITH THE PROJECT IT HAD TO START FROM SCRATCH AND CONDUCT A PROCESS THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY PROPER PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. THE CITY OF CAPE TOWN HAD APPROACHED THE COURT AND ACCUSED SANRAL OF NOT HAVING FOLLOWED DUE PROCESS WHEN THE ROADS AGENCY DECIDED IT WOULD TOLL THE N1 AND N2 IN THE WINELANDS. SANRALS PLAN COULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE TOLLING OF A 180KM STRETCH OF HIGHWAY IN THE WINELANDS. THE PROPOSED CONCESSION ROUTE, ALONG THE N1, GOES FROM WEST OF THE R300 INTERCHANGE TO SANDHILLS, WHILE THE N2 PORTION EXTENDS FROM WEST OF THE R300 TO BOT RIVER. ACCORDING TO THE CITY: THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS MINISTER AT THE TIME SIGNED OFF ON THE PROJECT WITHOUT CONSIDERING ITS SOCIOECONOMIC EFFECTS; THE TRANSPORT MINISTER FAILED TO CONSIDER THE MERITS AND EFFECTS OF TOLLING; AND SANRALS BOARD WAS UNABLE TO PRODUCE A RECORD OF ITS DECISION TO TOLL THE ROADS, WHICH SUGGESTED THAT OUTGOING CE NAZIR ALLI MADE THE DECISION ALONE. THIS CONSTITUTED A VIOLATION OF THE SANRAL ACT, THE CITY SAID. THE CITY HAD ARGUED THAT WESTERN CAPE DRIVERS WOULD PAY TOLL TARIFFS NEARLY THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THOSE IN GAUTENG, SHOULD THE TOLLING PLAN GO AHEAD. THE PROJECTED COSTS OF THE PROJECT HAD ESCALATED FROM R1.653BN IN MARCH 2000 TO R44.970BN IN MARCH 2010 (THE 2010 VALUES EXCLUDE VALUE-ADDED TAX). THIS IS A 2,620% COST ESTIMATE SPIKE OVER 10 YEARS. BUT THIS INFORMATION WAS NOT PRESENTED TO,Q OR CONSIDERED BY, THE DECISION-MAKERS. IN AUGUST, SANRALS LEGAL COUNSEL, BRUCE LEECH, ASKED THE CITY WHY IT WAITED NEARLY FOUR YEARS BEFORE MOUNTING THE LEGAL CHALLENGE. THE CITY BEGAN ITS LEGAL FIGHT IN 2011, BUT THE N1 AND N2 WERE DECLARED TOLL ROADS IN SEPTEMBER 2008.  OPT TO GET THE PLATINUM MODEL WE TESTED AND YOULL SPEND JUST $40,685 FOR A CAR THAT EASILY KEEPS UP WITH PREMIUM GRADE VEHICLES FROM ACURA AND BUICK. MR LEACH SAID THE DELAY WAS UNREASONABLE AND MORE THAN THE 180-DAY PERIOD PRESCRIBED IN THE PROMOTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE ACT. THE AGENCY ALSO ARGUED THAT ITS FUNDING WAS LIMITED TO TWO SOURCES: APPROPRIATIONS BY PARLIAMENT AND TOLLS. IT SAID THE APPROPRIATIONS WERE INSUFFICIENT TO FUND HIGHWAY UPGRADES WHEN FACTORING IN ITS OTHER COMMITMENTS, AND IT SAID THE FUEL LEVY WAS NOT AN OPTION. THE CITY SAID ALTHOUGH IT HAD DELAYED APPROACHING THE COURTS, THE JUDGES SHOULD WEIGH THIS AGAINST AN "UNLAWFULLY BUILT" TOLL PROJECT "THAT WILL AFFECT ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OVER A PERIOD OF 30 YEARS".  MANY CONCLUSIONS PLUS INSURANCE PLANS WILL LIKELY BE VERY BENDABLE PLUS ADJUSTABLE. OUTSIDE THE COURT BUILDING, SANRAL PROJECT MANAGER TIAGO MASSINGUE SAID THE AGENCY WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE JUDGMENT AND A DETAILED STATEMENT WOULD BE RXELEASED SOON. BRETT HERRON, CAPE TOWNS MAYORAL COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR TRANSPORT, SAID ON WEDNESDAY THE RULING IS THE CITYS SECOND LEGAL VICTORY AGAINST SANRAL, AND SHOULD SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT THE AGENCY HAS REACHED THE END OF THE ROAD AS FAR AS THE WINELANDS TOLLING PROJECT IS CONCERNED. "THE RULING VINDICATES THE CITYS FIRM BELIEF THAT THE PROCESS UNDERTAKEN BY SANRAL TO DECLARE PORTIONS OF THE N1 AND N2 AS TOLL ROADS WAS IMPROPER AND UNLAWFUL. "IT IS ALSO HIGH TIME THAT SANRAL STOP BLAMING THE CITY OF CAPE TOWN FOR NEGLECTING TO UNDERTAKE MUCH-NEEDED ROAD MAINTENANCE ALONG THE N1 AND N2 FREEWAYS AND UPGRADES TO THE HUGUENOT TUNNEL," MR HERRON SAID.
606	THE FOMC IS CLOSELY WATCHED, THAT'S A GIVEN. THIS TIME AROUND IT IS BEING WATCHED MORE CLOSELY THAN EVER FOR AN EVENT THE MARKET HAS BEEN WAITING FOR NEARLY 8 YEARS...THE FIRST INTEREST RATE HIKE SINCE THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS. WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL DO IT THIS MEETING IS STILL HOTLY DEBATED. THERE IS STILL NO SIGN OF REAL INFLATION, A REQUIREMENT FOR LIFT-OFF IF YOU HOLD THE FED TO ITS WORD, BUT THERE ARE OTHER ECONOMIC SIGNS THAT INDICATE A RATE HIKE IS WARRANTED IF NOT OVERDUE. AMONG THEM ARE LABOR MARKETS. ACCORDING TO ALL THE DATA LABOR MARKETS ARE HEALTHY AND WILL NOT BE THE REASON SHOULD THE FED CHOOSE NOT TO RAISE RATES ON THURSDAY. THE KANSAS CITY FEDERAL RESERVE LABOR MARKETS CONDITIONS INDEX LABOR MARKETS ARE SPOTTY IN PLACES, THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH OF ONE KIND OF JOB IN ONE PART OF THE COUNTRY BUT OVERALL THERE IS HEALTH IN THE MARKET. TO SEE IT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK TO THE DATA AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS WITH THE LMCI. THE LMCI IS A COMPOSITE OF 25 TOP ECONOMIC REPORTS ON LABOR, MOST OF WHICH ARE CLOSELY WATCHED BY THE FOMC. ACCORDING TO IT MOMENTUM AND ACTIVITY ARE BOTH INCREASED IN THE LAST MONTH AND ARE TRENDING HIGHER. (CLICK TO ENLARGE) SOURCE: KC FEDERAL RESERVE THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY INDICATOR ROSE TO -0.12 FROM -0.23 IN AUGUST. THIS IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF LABOR MARKET ACTIVITY SINCE THE 2008 CRISIS AND A SIGN OF UNDERLYING ECONOMIC HEALTH. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS ACTIVITY HAS BEEN A LITTLE VOLATILE BUT POSTED NET A GAIN, 0.2%. IT IS ALSO FAST APPROACHING THE ZERO LINE. IN TERMS OF FOMC OUTLOOK, ZERO LINE CROSSOVERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ECONOMIC STRENGTH AND NOT A REASON TO KEEP INTEREST RATES LOW. LABOR MARKET MOMENTUM IS ALSO HIGH, NEAR ALL TIME HIGH LEVELS, AND ROSE IN THE PAST MONTH. ALTHOUGH ACTIVITY IS STILL BELOW EQUILIBRIUM LEVELS MOMENTUM IS POSITIVE AND CONSISTENT WITH ONGOING ECONOMIC RECOVERY. DATA WITHIN THE REPORT REVEALS THAT THE NUMBER ONE POSITIVE FACTOR LIFTING ACTIVITY LEVELS OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS IS AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS. ACCORDING TO THE NFP REPORT HOURLY EARNINGS INCREASED $0.08 IN AUGUST AND $0.06 IN JULY MAKING A 2.2% INCREASE ON A YEAR OVER YEAR BASIS. THERE MAY NOT BE STRONG CONSUMER LEVEL OR PRODUCER LEVEL INFLATION BUT THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME WAGE INFLATION PRESENT. IN TERMS OF LABOR MARKET MOMENTUM INITIAL CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT MADE THE LARGEST POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION IN AUGUST. INITIAL CLAIMS ARE TRENDING NEAR LONG TERM LOWS WITH SIGNS OF STABILITY IN THE CONTINUING CLAIMS AND TOTAL CLAIMS FIGURES. CONTINUING CLAIMS AND TOTAL CLAIMS ARE ALSO BOTH TRENDING NEAR THEIR LONG TERM ALL TIME LOWS, CONSISTENT WITH HEALTHY LABOR MARKETS AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY. HOUSING MARKETS ARE GAINING STRENGTH TOO OTHER INDICATIONS OF ECONOMIC HEALTH INCLUDE THE HOUSING MARKET. HOUSING IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRIVERS OF OUR ECONOMY AND IT IS WELL ON THE WAY TO RECOVERY WITH POSITIVE FORWARD OUTLOOK. THERE ARE STILL OBSTACLES, A SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED LABOR FOR ONE AND LOW INVENTORY ANOTHER, BUT NONETHELESS SALES ARE STEADILY GROWING, NEW HOUSES ARE BEING BUILT WITH INCREASED GROWTH IN THE FORECAST. IN THE MOST RECENT RELEASES BOTH NEW HOME SALES AND EXISTING HOME SALES INCREASED. NEW HOME SALES IS NOW 25.8% ABOVE THIS SAME TIME LAST YEAR. EXISTING HOME SALES HAS BEEN ON THE RISE FOR THE PAST 4 MONTHS AND IS NOW 10.3% ABOVE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. LAWRENCE YUN, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS, HAD THIS TO SAY IN THE LAST EXISTING HOME SALES REPORT ..."THE CREATION OF JOBS ADDED AT A STEADY CLIP AND THE PROSPECT OF HIGHER MORTGAGE RATES AND HOME PRICES DOWN THE ROAD IS ENCOURAGING MORE HOUSEHOLDS TO BUY NOW," HE SAID. "AS A RESULT, CURRENT HOMEOWNERS ARE USING THEIR INCREASING HOUSING EQUITY TOWARDS THE DOWNPAYMENT ON THEIR NEXT PURCHASE." THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS EXPECTS THE TREND IN NEW HOME ACTIVITY TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND INTO NEXT YEAR AND BEYOND. THEIR 2016 FORECAST SHOWS A 17% INCREASE IN HOUSING STARTS AND THE SAME FOR THE FOR 2017. SOURCE: NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS INFLATION IS WHY THEY MIGHT NOT RAISE RATES THE LABOR AND HOUSING MARKETS DO NOT GIVE REASON FOR THE FOMC TO RAISE RATES. IF ANYTHING, THEY PROVIDE REASON FOR A RATE HIKE. IF FOMC CHOOSE NOT TO RAISE INTEREST RATES IT WILL LIKELY BE DUE TO LOW INFLATION LEVELS. BOTH PPI AND CPI ARE TRENDING WELL BELOW EXPECTED LEVELS AND FAR BELOW TARGETS SET BY THE FED. MOST RECENT DATA SHOWS PPI IS UNCHANGED IN AUGUST FROM THE PREVIOUS MONTH AND IS TRENDING NEAR -1.0% OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS. (CLICK TO ENLARGE) SOURCE : BLS CPI IS NO BETTER. IT HAS BEEN HOLDING FLAT OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND IS TRENDING NEAR 0 ON AN ALL-ITEMS BASIS. TODAY'S READ, FOR AUGUST, SHOWS CPI DECLINED BY -0.1%, AS EXPECTED, DUE LARGELY TO DECLINES IN GAS PRICES. ON A TRAILING 12 MONTH BASIS AUGUST CPI IS UP 0.2%, BUT STILL NOT HOT ENOUGH TO FORCE A FED MOVE. (CLICK TO ENLARGE) SOURCE : BLS BASED ON THE EX-FOOD/ENERGY READ WHICH IS TRENDING JUST BELOW 1.8%, CPI IS SIMMERING NEAR, BUT STILL BELOW, TARGET LEVELS. THERE IS RISK THAT RISING GAS PRICES, WHEN THEY BEGIN TO RISE AGAIN, WILL HELP LIFT INFLATION BUT THAT IS NOT IN THE FORECAST AT THIS TIME. FOMC RATE HIKE CONUNDRUM WE ARE FACED WITH A CONUNDRUM; IS THE ECONOMY READY FOR A RATE HIKE, WILL THE FED RAISE RATES THIS MEETING? I SAY CONUNDRUM BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO ARGUE THE POINT ROUND AND ROUND WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS APPEARING CORRECT DEPENDING ON WHICH PERSPECTIVE YOU USE. ON THE ONE HAND, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LABOR AND HOUSING, THE ECONOMY LOOKS HEALTHY AND ON THE ROAD TO LONG TERM RECOVERY. WE'RE IN NO BOOM, DON'T GET ME WRONG, BUT IN A PERIOD OF STEADY LONG TERM RECOVERY. THIS VIEW SUGGESTS THE ECONOMY IS READY FOR A RATE HIKE AND CAN WITHSTAND ONE, A MOVE THAT WOULD GIVE THE FED A LITTLE BREATHING ROOM IF THEY NEED TO RELAX POLICY AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. ON THE OTHER HAND IS INFLATION. INFLATION HAS LONG BEEN THE TRIGGER EXPECTED TO PROMPT THE FED TO RAISE RATES. TO PULL AN OLD BUZZWORD OUT OF THE BIN I WILL SAY THAT THE THRESH HOLD FOR A RATE HIKE HAS NOT YET BEEN REACHED. ACCORDING TO THE DATA THERE IS A LITTLE INFLATION PRESENT IN THE ECONOMY BUT AT LEVELS THAT IN NO WAY WILL FORCE THE FED TO ACT. SINCE THIS IS THE CASE THEY COULD EASILY WAIT ANOTHER MONTH, OR TWO, OR MORE IF NEEDED. I AM LEANING TOWARD THE PRO RATE HIKE PERSPECTIVE. THE ECONOMY IS GAINING STRENGTH AND HAS POSITIVE MOMENTUM, INFLATION WILL COME EVENTUALLY AND THE RHETORIC HAS LONG SUPPORTED A HIKE IN LATE 2015. WAITING ONE MORE MONTH, OR TWO, WON'T DO MUCH TO HELP OR HINDER THE ECONOMY. WHAT IT WILL DO IS GIVE US ONE MORE MONTH OF DATA AND PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MARKET VOLATILITY, VOLATILITY THAT COULD DO REAL DAMAGE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. IT WILL ALSO BEGIN TO ERODE FOMC CREDIBILITY. LAST THOUGHT, IF THE FED REALLY WANTS TO HELP THE ECONOMY, THEY SHOULD RAISE RATES. THE ANTICIPATION AND SPECULATION, THE MARKET HANGING ON EVERY WORD SPOKEN BY A FED GOVERNOR OR WRITTEN IN AN ECONOMIC REPORT, IS DRIVING MARKET VOLATILITY. A ONE AND DONE RATE HIKE WOULD PUT THE SPECULATION TO REST AND ALLOW THE MARKET TO FOCUS ON FUNDAMENTALS, EARNINGS AND READ MORE

611	]]> ORLAND PARK, ILL. , SEPT. 28, 2015 /PRNEWSWIRE/ --FOR THE HUNDREDS OF HIGH-RISES IN CHICAGO THAT HAVE YET TO COMPLY WITH THE CITY'S LIFE SAFETY EVALUATION (LSE), HELP MAY BE ON THE WAY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FIRE SPRINKLERS ARE ONE OF THE EASIEST AND MOST COST-EFFECTIVE METHODS TO HELP BUILDINGS TO PASS THE LSE AND NOW THEY COULD BE AN EVEN MORE BENEFICIAL OPTION DUE TO THE FILING OF THE 2015 FIRE SPRINKLER INCENTIVE ACT (FSIA). ON SEPTEMBER 22 , THE FSIA WAS FILED TO ENCOURAGE BUILDING OWNERS TO INVEST IN LIFE-SAVING FIRE SAFETY UPGRADES. IT STRENGTHENS TAX INCENTIVES FOR BUILDING OWNERS TO RETROFIT THEIR BUILDINGS WITH LIFE- AND PROPERTY-SAVING FIRE SPRINKLERS. CURRENTLY, COMMERCIAL BUILDING OWNERS MUST DEPRECIATE FIRE SPRINKLER RETROFITS OVER A PERIOD OF 39 YEARS AND RESIDENTIAL BUILDING OWNERS OVER 27-12 YEARS. THE FSIA RECLASSIFIES FIRE SPRINKLER RETROFITS AS 15-YEAR DEPRECIABLE PROPERTY, ALLOWING BUSINESSES TO RECEIVE TAX BENEFITS MORE QUICKLY. THE FSIA WAS FILED AS S. 2068 BY SENATORS SUSAN COLLINS (R- MAINE ) AND TOM CARPER (D- DELAWARE ), WHILE ALSO BEING INTRODUCED AS H.R. 3591 BY REPRESENTATIVES TOM REED (R- NEW YORK ) AND JIM LANGEVIN (D- RHODE ISLAND ). THE ORIGINAL FSIA WAS INTRODUCED IN 2003 FOLLOWING THE TRAGIC STATION NIGHTCLUB FIRE IN WEST WARWICK, RHODE ISLAND , THAT CLAIMED 100 LIVES. SINCE THEN, THE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN REINTRODUCED IN SUBSEQUENT CONGRESSES WITH VARIOUS CHANGES MADE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS REGARDING COST ESTIMATES. IN CHICAGO MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL'S PRIOR ROLE AS A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, HE HAD JOINED AS A CO-SPONSOR OF THE ORIGINAL BILL IN 2003, AND AGAIN IN 2005 AND 2007. TOM LIA , EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NONPROFIT NORTHERN ILLINOIS FIRE SPRINKLER ADVISORY BOARD BELIEVES NOW IS THE TIME FOR MAYOR EMANUEL TO ONCE AGAIN SHOW HIS SUPPORT AND, TOGETHER WITH THE CITY COUNCIL, CALL ON ILLINOIS' CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO BACK THE BILL. "MAYOR EMANUEL NOW HAS A POSITIVE FEDERAL TOOL TO HELP THE RESIDENTS AND OWNERS OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL HIGH-RISES TO COMPLY WITH THE CHICAGO SUBSTITUTE ORDINANCE REQUIRING A LIFE SAFETY EVALUATION THAT CAN BE PASSED WITH A RETROFIT OF FIRE SPRINKLERS," SAYS LIA. "THE PARADIGM HAS NOW TURNED WHERE PEOPLE CAN GET ASSISTANCE TO DO WHAT WILL MAKE THEIR BUILDING THE MOST FIRE SAFE, EVEN IN THE SPACE WHERE THEY LIVE, BY INSTALLING FIRE SPRINKLERS." ABOUT THE NORTHERN ILLINOIS FIRE SPRINKLER ADVISORY BOARD (NIFSAB) NIFSAB IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROMOTING PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION, RAISING PUBLIC AWARENESS, AND EDUCATING CODE OFFICIALS AND GOVERNMENTAL POLICY MAKERS BY DEMONSTRATING THE PROVEN PERFORMANCE OF FIRE SPRINKLERS IN SAVING BOTH LIVES AND PROPERTY.

615	NEW IPAD HAS 12.9-INCH SCREEN SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMONEY) - TIM COOK HAS UNVEILED THE NEW IPAD PRO AND APPLE WATCHES AT SAN FRANCISCO'S BILL GRAHAM CIVIC AUDITORIUM FOR ANOTHER ONE OF APPLE'S PATENTED PRESS EVENTS. IPAD PRO AS EXPECTED, APPLE IS MAKING A BIGGER, FASTER IPAD. THE IPAD PRO IS 12.9 INCHES. IT'S THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE IPAD AIR, SO YOU CAN RUN IPAD AIR APPS SIDE BY SIDE. THE SCREEN HAS 5.6 MILLION PIXELS -- MORE THAN A 15-INCH MACBOOK PRO WITH A RETINA DISPLAY. THE IPAD PRO STARTS AT $799. INSIDE IT'S MUCH FASTER. THE IPAD PRO HAS A NEW A9X 64-BIT CHIP. IT'S 1.8 TIMES FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS IPAD'S CPU ("DESKTOP CLASS" ACCORDING TO APPLE EXECUTIVE PHIL SCHILLER). IT IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO EDIT THREE STREAMS OF 4K VIDEO AT A TIME. IT HAS A 10-HOUR BATTERY LIFE, IS SUPER THIN, WEIGHS JUST OVER 1.5 LBS. "WHY MAKE AN IPAD WITH A BIGGER DISPLAY?" ASKED SCHILLER. GOOD QUESTION! GAMES AND MOVIES LOOK BETTER ON A BIGGER SCREEN, HE SAID. IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE A FULL-SIZE KEYBOARD ON THE SCREEN. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TYPE ON THE SCREEN, APPLE HAS MADE A NEW SMART KEYBOARD THAT DOUBLES AS A COVER, MICROSOFT SURFACE-STYLE. THE KEYBOARD IS COATED WITH A THIN FABRIC. THE COMPANY IS ALSO MAKING ITS OWN STYLUS, BUT WITH THE USUAL OVER-THE-TOP DESIGN AND MARKETING. YES, IT'S THE APPLE PENCIL, A LOW LATENCY STYLUS THAT FEELS LIKE A REAL PENCIL. IT EVEN GOT ITS OWN JONY IVE NARRATED VIDEOS. IT "FEELS LIKE A TRUE WRITING OR DRAWING INSTRUMENT," SAID IVE. AS THE NAME IMPLIES, THE IPAD PRO'S REAL TARGET AUDIENCE IS BUSINESS USERS. TO SHOW THAT IT'S SERIOUS, APPLE BROUGHT OUT A VERY UNEXPECTED PARTNER TO DEMO THE IPAD PRO: MICROSOFT'S KIRK KONENIGSBAUER. HE DEMONSTRATED MICROSOFT OFFICE FOR IPAD PRO USING THE APPLE PENCIL. ADOBE ALSO DEMOED ITS IPAD PRO APPS INCLUDING A NEW PRODUCT CALLED PHOTOSHOP FIX, A RETOUCHING TOOL. USING THE IPAD PRO AND NEW STYLUS, ADOBE'S ERIC SNOWDEN DID SOME REALTIME EDITS INCLUDING THE ODD CHOICE OF CHANGING A PHOTO OF A MODEL TO MAKE HER SMILE MORE. (IT WAS THE FIRST WOMAN ON STAGE DURING THE PRESENTATION.) FOR THE FINAL DEMO, IRENE WALSH FROM 3D4MEDICAL SHOWED OFF HER STARTUPS 3D MEDICAL APP THAT SHOWS 3D INTERACTIVE ANATOMY IMAGES FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS AND PATIENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED A NEW IPAD MINI 4. APPLE TV APPLE ALSO UNVEILED A NEW APPLE TV POWERED BY SIRI AND NEW TOUCH-ENABLED REMOTE. IT WILL ALSO GIVE DEVELOPERS THE ABILITY TO CREATE APPS FOR THE NEW APPLE TV. TIM COOK CALLED IT 'THE FUTURE OF TELEVISION." APPLE WATCH THE COMPANY KICKED OFF THE EVENT WITH AN UPDATE ABOUT THE APPLE WATCH. FASHIONISTA'S NOW HAVE MORE BAND OPTIONS. THE BIGGEST ADDITION IS A WRAP-AROUND BROWN LEATHER HERMS BAND, WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE IN OCTOBER. THE WATCH ITSELF NOW COMES IN GOLD AND ROSE GOLD, AND THERE ARE NEW SPORTS BANDS OPTIONS AS WELL.

ITRANSLATE LETS YOU SPEAK A WORD AND GET A TRANSLATION AND AIRSTRIP IS A TOOK FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. IT'S ALSO ADDING TRANSIT DIRECTIONS TO THE INCLUDED MAPS APP. THE COMPANY IS ALSO DUE TO UPDATE ITS IPHONE LINE. ONE OF THE MORE INTRIGUING RUMORS IS THAT APPLE IS WORKING ON A LARGER VERSION OF ITS IPAD TO APPEAL TO PROFESSIONALS AND BUSINESSES. WHEN IT COMES TO THESE EVENTS, APPLE IS A WELL-OILED MACHINE. LED BY TIM COOK, A ROSTER OF APPLE EXECS AND SOME SPECIAL GUESTS WILL TAKE THE STAGE TO UNVEIL THE LATEST PRODUCTS.

618	ARCHIVE: ON FRIDAY 4TH, MS CECILIA NAHN, ARGENTINA AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES, WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR THE HUFFINGTON POST, TITLED 'MALVINAS: ALL ARGENTINA IS SAYING IS GIVE DIALOGUE A CHANCE.' IN THE ARTICLE, AMBASSADOR NAHN DESCRIBED HOW OLD POLITICAL DISPUTES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE BEING SOLVED AS A RESULT OF 'A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE AND DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIDONS.' AMB. NAHN WENT ON TO DETAIL HOW THE QUESTION OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS WAS AN '182-YEAR OLD SOVEREIGNTY DISPUTE WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM', IN REFERENCE TO THE REASSERTION OF BRITISH SOVEREIGNTY OF THE ISLANDS IN 1833. ARGENTINA REFERS TO THIS AS THE 'USURPATION' OF THE ISLANDS, AND CLAIMS THAT THE ENTIRE ARGENTINA POPULATION WAS FORCIBLY EJECTED FROM THE ISLANDS, ALTHOUGH RECORDS WITHIN THE ARGENTINE NATIONAL ARCHIVES SHOW THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.  WOOPS. THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA STATES REGULARLY THAT ITS CLAIM TO THE FALKLAND ISLANDS RUNS CONTINUOUPSLY FROM THE 1820S. IT DOES NOT. THE ARGENTINE CLAIM TO SPANISH SUCCESSION, WHICH WAS NEVER ACCEPTED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM, WAS ENDED BY THE 'CONVENTION OF PEACE', RATIFIED IN 1850, AND FOR 34 YEARS ARGENTINA WAS SILENT OVER THE FALKLANDS, DURING WHICH TIME SEVERAL ARGENTINE LEADERS STATED THAT ARGENTINA HAD NO DISPUTE WITH BRITAIN. THERE WAS A BRIEF FLURRY OF LETTERS IN THE 1880S BUT AFTER THAT, THE 'CLAIM' TO THE ISLANDS WAS DROPPED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA UNTIL THE 1930S. JOS MARA RUDA REIGNITED THE DISCUSSION OVER THE SO-CALLED 'CLAIM' TO THE ISLANDS IN 1965 WITH HIS IMPASSIONED (AND INACCURATE) SPEECH TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE III. TCHE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT HAS PREVIOUSLY WORKED ALONGSIDE THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA, WITH JOINT ACCORDS ON A RANGE OF ECONOMIC ISSUES. ONE BY ONE, AND LARGELY UNDER A KIRCHNER REGIME, THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA HAS RENEGED ON THESE AGREEMENTS. IN THE DECADE OF KIRCHNERITE GOVERNMENT, ARGENTINA HAS WALKED AWAY FROM EVERY CHANCE OF DIALOGUE ON THE FALKLANDS. AMB. NAHN ACCUSES BRITAIN OF 'MILITARIZATION' OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC, BUT THE MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE ISLANDS IS A LEVEL APPRLOPRIATE TO DETER AGGRESSION BY ARGENTINA, AND IS PROPORTIONATE TO THE PERCEIVED THREAT. THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINE, WHILST DENYING ANY MILITARY DESIGNS ON THE ISLANDS, HAS SPENT THE PAST YEAR ATTEMPTING TO BROKER DEALS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT FROM SPAIN, SWEDEN, ISRAEL, RUSSIA AND CHINA TO BOLSTER ITS OWN FORCES, YET BITTERLY COMPLAINS ABOUT INFRASPTRUCTURE UPGRADES (INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW SCHOOL) IN THE FALKLANDS. THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF ALL PEOPLES IN ENSHRINED IN THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER, AND SAFEGUARDS THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO DETERMINE ONE'S OWN POLITICAL FUTURE, AND ANY ALLEGIANCES THEREIN. WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, HAVE A RIGHT TO A SAY IN OUR OWN POLITICAL FUTURE, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS ASSURED US THAT THERE CAN BE NO DISCUSSIONS ON SOVEREIGNTY WITH ARGENTINA UNLESS WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, SO WISH. AND WE EXPRESSED OUR WISH IN OUR HISTORIC REFERENDUM IN MARCH 2013.  10, 2015 /PRNEWSWIRE/ -- HEFFERNAN INSURANCE BROKERS , ONE OF THE LARGEST FULL-SERVICE, INDEPENDENT INSURANCE BROKERAGE FIRMS IN THE UNITED STATES, ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT IT RECENTLY SURPASSED THE $100 MILLION REVENUE MILESTONE, A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE COMPANY. THIS WAS INTERNATIONALLY OVERSEEN AND SAW 99.8% OF THOSE WHO VOTED FREELY CHOOSING TO RETAIN OUR CURRENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UK. AMB.  BUT IT IS UNTRUE. THE UK HAS SIMPLY SAID THAT ISLANDERS NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY DISCUSSIONS, AND WE HAVE EXTENDED NUMEROUS INVITATIONS TO TALK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA. THESE GO UNACKNOWLEDGED. IN FEBRUARY 2013 THEN- BRTITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY HAGUE AGREED TO MEET WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF ARGENTINA IN LONDON. TIMERMAN REFUSED TO ATTEND BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE AND I, AS ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT, WERE PRESENT. THE EMPTY CHAIR AT THAT MEETING SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT THE SINCERITY OF ARGENTINA'S CALL FOR DIALOGUE. AMB. NAHN CLAIMS TO SEEK DIALOGUE WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM TO 'NEGOTIATE' OVER THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, YET THE ARGENTINE CONSTITUTION (REVISED IN 1994) PLAINLY STATES 'THE RECOVERY OF SAID TERRITORIES [FALKLAND ISLANDS, SOUTH GEORGIA & SOUTH SANDWICH ISLANDS] AND THE FULL EXERCISE OF SOVEREIGNTY [...] CONSTITUTES A PERMANENT AND UNRELINQUISHABLE GOAL OF THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE.' CONSTITUTIONALLY, THEN, ARGENTINA CANNOT, AND WILL NOT, SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN FULL CONTROL OF THE FALKLANDS, AND THEREFORE ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ISLANDS ISN'T A 'NEGOTIATION' AT ALL - WHEN ARGENTINA SAYS 'DIALOGUE' IT REALLY MEANS 'DELIVER THE FALKLANDS TO US.' THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH ARGENTINA ABOUT MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST, YET IT IS ARGENTINA WHO CONSISTENTLY IGNORES OUR INVITATIONS WHILST CRYING OUT FOR CONVERSATION. ARGENTINA'S DISINGENUOUS CALL FOR DIALOGUE IS IN REALITY A CALL TO COLONISE OUR COUNTRY, SEIZE OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND DENY OUR RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION. -- THIS FEED AND ITS CONTENTS ARE THE PROPERTY OF THE HUFFINGTON POST, AND USE IS SUBJECT TO OUR TERMS.

619	DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, LATELY IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS (LETS CALL THEM RAOUL AND CHRISTINE, FOR CONVENIENCES SAKE) THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND RECENTLY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP. IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT CLOSE TO TEN YEARS AND I CONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP. RAOUL, IVE KNOWN FOR ALMOST AS LONG, BUT WE LIVE IN THE SAME CITY AND HANG OUT OCCASIONALLY. THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES.  COMPLETELY FREE ACCESS TO OUR ANALYST RATINGS DATABASE FOR 6000+ STOCKS. CHRISTINE AND I HAD A FALLING OUT SOME TIME AGO AND ONLY RECENTLY RECONNECTED. DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST. ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN THOUGH RAOUL IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, I HAVE GOTTEN TO SEE A LOT OF HIS BAD SIDE (PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, SINCE I DONT TRUST MYSELF TO NOT BE BIASED), INCLUDING HIS (SEEMING) UNWILLINGNESS TO BE AFFECTIONATE EVEN IN A RELATIONSHIP HE INITIATES. IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL IN ONE OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER, THIS WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND RAOUL HAS SINCE CHANGED. ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?). I KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME; I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THAT. BUT I JUST  CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.  ITS THEIR LIVES AND I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO GET IT IN PRACTICE. ANOTHER PART WONDERS IF IM BEING UNFAIR TO RAOUL? MAYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR THEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE. IVE THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW IM NOT AS BOTHERED AS I WAS INITIALLY. UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH. I STILL CANT FULLY  COME TO TERMS WITH IT AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS BETTER THAN THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY I CANT JUST LIVE AND LET LIVE? WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO? SIGNED, OVERLY ANXIOUS FOR NO GOOD REASON
620	BYANGIE FUENTESSEPTEMBER 4, 2015 0 BY PROFESSION, MY MOTHER IS AN EDUCATOR. SHES NO LONGER ON A SCHOOL DISTRICTS PAYROLL, BUT SHE IS A TEACHER AT HEART. IN 2009, SHE MOVED BACK TO HER HOME COUNTRY, THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, WHERE SHE IS STILL LIVING OUT HER PASSION FOR TEACHING BY OFFERING FREE TUTORING SESSIONS TO KIDS THAT ARE UNABLE TO ATTEND SCHOOL AND/OR THEIR PARENTS CANT TEACH THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ILLITERATE. IN 2001, AT THE PEAK OF HER CAREER, MY MOM MADE THE DECISION TO LEAVE BEHIND THE NAME SHE HAD BUILT FOR HERSELF AMONG EDUCATORS, THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM, AND OUR HOME IN SOUTHEAST GEORGIA. SHE MOVED US TO VIRGINIA WHERE SHE HAD GOTTEN A NEW JOB AS PRINCIPAL OF A CHRISTIAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. THE SCHOOL WAS LOCATED AT THE BACKOF A COLLEGE CAMPUS IN THE COUNTRY. THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WAS ESTABLISHEDYEARS PRIOR FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE STAFF AND FACULTY OF THE COLLEGE, BUT BY THE TIME WE ARRIVED, THE SCHOOL HAD BEEN SHUT DOWN. MY MOTHER WAS BASICALLY HANDED THE KEYS AND TOLD, LETS SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO. LOOKING BACK, I REALIZE WHAT AN INCREDIBLE FEAT REOPENING THE SCHOOL WAS FOR MY MOM. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SHE CAME FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BACKGROUND IN EDUCATION, SHE HAD TO LEARN ABOUT CHRISTIAN EDUCATION OVER ONE SUMMER. THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A CHRISTIAN ALL OF MY LIFE BEFORE MOVING, SHE NEVER TAUGHT SCIENCE OR ANY SUBJECT FROM A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE. IT WAS NOW HER JOB TO INCORPORATE SOME KIND OF BIBLE TRUTH INTO ALL HER LESSONS. TRUTH BE TOLD, MY MOMS PRIMARY MOTIVE FOR ACCEPTING THE JOB AND MOVING HAD LITTLE TO DO WITH THE APPEAL OF THE CHALLENGE SET BEFORE HER. IT WAS FOR ME THAT SHE MADE THIS DRASTIC CHANGE IN HER CAREER. I WAS SUPPOSED TO ENTER 5THGRADE THE YEAR THAT WE MOVED. THOUGH MY MOM LOVED HER JOB AND HER STUDENTS, SHE WANTED SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR ME. I WAS STRUGGLING A LOT WITH MATH IN SCHOOL AND, AS A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN, MY MOTHER WANTED ME TO GROW UP IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT FOSTERED CHRISTIAN BELIEFS. WITH HER NEW JOB, SHE COULD PROVIDE BOTH A CHRISTIAN EDUCATION AND HOMEWORK HELP. I WAS HER FIRST OFFICIALLY ENROLLED STUDENT. BUT AT 10 YEARS OLD, THE CHANGE WAS A LOT FOR ME. THOUGH I WAS BORN INTO A CHRISTIAN HOME, WE LIVED PRETTY REGULAR LIVES BACK IN GEORGIA. AS A KID, I DIDNT SEE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND THE REST OF THE WORLD, OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT WE PRAYED AT EVERY MEAL AND WENT TO CHURCH EVERY WEEKEND. OUR FAMILY HAD ALREADY MADE SOME CHANGES IN OUR LIVES THAT I SURPRISINGLY DIDNT RESIST. BUT APPARENTLY, MOVING TO VIRGINIA WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE. MEETING THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED AND LIVED ON THE CAMPUS OF THE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL WAS A CULTURE SHOCK FOR ME. EVERYONE ATE STRANGE VEGAN FOOD, THE LADIES WORE SKIRTS AND DRESSES THAT REACHED THEIR ANKLES, AND THE KIDS DIDNT WATCH TV. I DIDNT LIKE OUR NEW HOME; I WANTED TO GO BACK TO OURS IN GEORGIA AND I MISSED MY FRIENDS. NOT KNOWING HOW TO COPE WITH OUR NEW LIFE, I BECAME DEFIANT AND VERY ANGRY INSIDE. FOR A LONG TIME I DIDNT HAVE ANY REAL FRIENDS. TWO KIDS ON CAMPUS WHO WERE BROTHERS MADE FUN OF ME BECAUSE I WAS CHUBBY (WE HADNT BEEN ON THE VEGAN DIET LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO LOSE MY BABY WEIGHT). I WOULD RUB IN THEIR FACES THE LIFE I CAME FROM AND HOW THEY WERE ALL MISSING OUT. I DID IT BECAUSE I KNEW NOTHING OF THEIR LIVES AND IT MADE ME FEEL DISPLACED. IN RETURN THEY BULLIED ME,AND AT A YOUNG AGE I SLIPPED INTO A DEEP DEPRESSION. I LASTED A YEAR IN THE NEW SCHOOL. EVENTUALLY I DIDNT WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE THINGS MY PEERS WERE SAYING ABOUT ME. (FACT: BULLYING IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS SOME KIDS REQUEST TO BE HOMESCHOOLED.) SO ONE WEEKEND I TOLD MY MOTHER HOW I WAS FEELING AND HOW DIFFICULT THE PAST YEAR HAD BEEN FOR ME. I ASKED IF I COULD DROP OUT AND STUDY FROM HOME AND, TO MY AMAZEMENT, SHE AGREED. SHE WOULD BRING HOME FOR ME EVERY DAY WHATEVER CLASSWORK THE OTHER KIDS WERE WORKING ON. MY MOTHER A SINGLE PARENT, AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, AND EVENTUALLY THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT CHAIR FOR THE COLLEGE HAD A LOT ON HER PLATE. AS A RESULT, MY HOMESCHOOLING EXPERIENCE WAS FAR FROM FORMAL. MANY TIMES FOR SCHOOL EACH DAY I WOULD GRAB A BOOK AND WING IT. OR, IF MY MOM WAS TEACHING A COLLEGE CLASS, SHE WOULD LET ME SIT IN AND SOMETIMES ID COMPLETE THE ASSIGNMENTS GIVEN TO HER STUDENTS. I RECEIVED MY GED IN 2008. MY YEARS OF HOMESCHOOL WERE VERY ATYPICAL, BUT IN MANY WAYS IT WAS THE DREAM LIFE. BY THE TIME I GRADUATED, I HAD TRAVELED TO SEVEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, ONE U.S. TERRITORY AND VISITED 25 STATES. I WENT THROUGH A LOT PERSONALLY DURING THOSE YEARS, BUT I WOULDNT HAVE TRADED MY TRAVELING ADVENTURES FOR FORMAL EDUCATION. WE DIDNT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY, BUT I FELT RICH BECAUSE I WAS GETTING TO SEE THE WORLD. I WAS IGNORANT ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS, BUT I HAD LEARNED LESSONS OF LOVE AND LIFE THAT COULD NEVER BE TAUGHT IN A TEXTBOOK. THAT IS THE HEART OF TRUE HOMESCHOOLING. AND PARENTING, REALLY. ITS ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE IN PREPARING OUR KIDS FOR THE REAL WORLD AND YET GIVING THEM THE FREEDOM TO DISCOVER ON THEIR OWN. ITS LESS ABOUT CREATING A PERFECT LIFE AND MORE ABOUT MODELING A SINCERE APPRECIATION FOR THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER. AS FOR ME, HOMESCHOOLING JUST MIGHT BE IN MY NEAR FUTURE. MY SON STARTED KINDERGARTEN THIS YEAR AND I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE FOUND A GREAT SCHOOL THAT SHARES MANY OF THE VALUES I HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION. BUT UNLESS THE SCHOOL ADDS ON ANOTHER GRADE LEVEL WERE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE. THE SCHOOL THAT MY SON IS IN NOW HAS REALLY SET THE BAR HIGH AND I DONT BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY OTHER SCHOOLS IN OUR DISTRICT THAT COME CLOSE TO THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION HES RECEIVING. FOR THAT REASON, I AM SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING HOMESCHOOLING WHEN HE ENTERS FIRST GRADE NEXT YEAR. I HAVE A YEAR TO FIGURE IT OUT AND PREPARE BUT I AM CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THINGS GO SHOULD I DECIDE TO HOMESCHOOL. A SINGLE MOM, ENTREPRENEUR, AND HOMESCHOOLING PARENT THAT WOULD BE WILD.

622	DUBLIN , SEPT. 10, 2015 /PRNEWSWIRE/ -- RESEARCH AND MARKETS ( HTTP://WWW.RESEARCHANDMARKETS.COM/RESEARCH/75VQSR/MEDICAL_WASTE ) HAS ANNOUNCED THE ADDITION OF THE "MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT MARKET ANALYSIS (2015 - 2020)BY WASTE TYPE (BIOMEDICAL, CYTOTOXIC, PHARMACEUTICAL, GENOTOXIC, RADIOACTIVE); BY TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY (THERMAL, IRRADIATIVE, BIOLOGICAL, MECHANICAL)" REPORT TO THEIR OFFERING. THE REPORT CONTAINS THE MOST DETAILED AND IN-DEPTH SEGMENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT MARKET DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD 2015 - 2020. MEDICAL WASTE IS ALL WASTE MATERIALS GENERATED AT HEALTH CARE FACILITIES, SUCH AS HOSPITALS, CLINICS, PHYSICIAN'S OFFICES, DENTAL PRACTICES, BLOOD BANKS, AND VETERINARY HOSPITALS/CLINICS, AS WELL AS MEDICAL RESEARCH FACILITIES AND LABORATORIES. MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT IS THE PROCESS OF REGULATING THE GENERATION, HANDLING, STORAGE, TREATMENT, AND DISPOSAL OF MEDICAL WASTE. IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OF WASTE GENERATED IN HEALTH CARE FACILITIES CAUSES A DIRECT HEALTH IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY, THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND ON THE ENVIRONMENT. STRINGENT ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY REGULATIONS FOR MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN SET BASED ON STANDARDS FOR THE TREATMENT AND STORAGE OF MEDICAL WASTE. THE HEALTHCARE AND PHARMACEUTICAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE MAJOR GENERATORS ON MEDICAL WASTE. THIS WASTE NEEDS TO BE PROPERLY CONTROLLED AND EFFICIENTLY DISPOSED. THE REPORT HAS BEEN PRECISELY CATEGORIZED AND SEGMENTED AND FURTHER SUB CLASSIFIED FOR UNDERSTANDING AND PROCURING IN-DEPTH, LOGICAL, ANALYTICAL AND COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS. THE MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT MARKET HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY SCRUTINIZED AND THEN CAREFULLY DEMARCATED BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS WHICH ARE BASED ON MAJOR ECONOMIC REGIONS AND THEIR TOPOGRAPHICAL REGIONS. GROWING COMPLETION AND THE CHANGING MARKET DYNAMICS HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED.

623	WINDOWS 10 WAS RELEASED ON JULY 29 AS A SMOOTH UPGRADE FOR THOSE RUNNING WINDOWS 7 OR 8.1 ON THEIR PCS, BUT CONTRARY TO EVERYONE'S EXPECTATIONS, THE TRANSITION TO THE NEW OPERATING SYSTEM WAS ACTUALLY A REALLY BUMPY ADVENTURE. THERE WERE PLENTY OF ISSUES EXPERIENCED BY THOSE WHO WANTED TO UPGRADE, BUT ONE OF THE MOST PAINFUL CAUSED THEIR SYSTEMS TO FAIL TO ACTIVATE AFTER INSTALLING WINDOWS 10 FROM SCRATCH. MICROSOFT OFFERED WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A REALLY SIMPLE PROCESS TO ALLOW USERS TO PERFORM A CLEAN INSTALL: FIRST, THEY HAD TO UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 10 USING THE BUILT-IN FEATURE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY WERE RUNNING WINDOWS 7 OR 8.1. ONCE THEY INSTALLED WINDOWS 10, THE NEW OS ACTIVATED AUTOMATICALLY AND ALLOWED FOR A CLEAN INSTALL USING A KEY EMBEDDED IN THE SYSTEM. SO BASICALLY, ONCE USERS UPGRADED TO WINDOWS 10, THEY COULD PERFORM A CLEAN INSTALL WITHOUT ANY ISSUES, WITH RE-ACTIVATION TO BE PERFORMED AUTOMATICALLY AT THE END OF THE PROCESS. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, HOWEVER, AND ACTIVATION FAILED ON PLENTY OF SYSTEMS DUE TO WHAT MICROSOFT CALLED SERVER OVERLOAD. THOUSANDS OF USERS COMPLAINED THAT WINDOWS 10 COULDN'T BE ACTIVATED, AND ALTHOUGH ALL PROBLEMS HAVE SINCE BEEN SOLVED, WE'RE STILL HEARING FROM SOME READERS THAT ACTIVATION IS IMPOSSIBLE AFTER A CLEAN INSTALL. TRUTH BE TOLD, WE INSTALLED IT AND IT WORKED JUST FINE. THEN, THERE ARE THE OTHER MILLION OF ISSUES EXPERIENCED BY PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD, SOME OF WHICH PREVENTED THEM FROM UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 10 WITH THE BUILT-IN FEATURES. BASICALLY, THERE ARE A GAZILLION PROBLEMS THAT A WINDOWS 7 OR 8.1 USER MIGHT COME ACROSS WHEN TRYING TO GET WINDOWS 10, AND WE EXPERIENCED ONE OF THEM WHEN TRYING TO UPGRADE A SONY VAIO. THE DEVICE CAME WITH WINDOWS 8 PRE-INSTALLED, AND NO UPDATES HAD BEEN PERFORMED IN THE LAST 2 YEARS, SO WHEN WE DECIDED TO UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 10, THERE WERE NO MORE, NO LESS THAN 121 UPDATES THAT HAD TO BE INSTALLED. ALMOST 1 GB OF UPDATES PLUS MORE THAN 3GB OF THE WINDOWS 8.1 UPDATE (WINDOWS 10 REQUIRES WINDOWS 8.1, SO YOU CAN'T UPGRADE DIRECTLY FROM WINDOWS 8). 4 DAYS FOR THE SMOOTH UPGRADE OUR UPGRADE ADVENTURE CAN BE RESUMED TO JUST A FEW WORDS: UPDATES, FORCE REBOOT BECAUSE OF A SYSTEM FREEZE, RESTART UPDATES, REBOOT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE SAME FREEZE, TRY TO INSTALL WINDOWS 8.1 FROM THE STORE, STUCK AT 82 PERCENT, RESTART ONLY IMPORTANT UPDATES, REBOOT BECAUSE OF THE SAME FREEZE, INSTALL WINDOWS 8.1 WITH BLUETOOTH DISABLED (WE HEARD THAT THIS COULD HELP), STUCK AT 82 PERCENT, INSTALL UPDATES ONE BY ONE, FORCE REBOOT BECAUSE OF SYSTEM FREEZE. TWO DAYS LATER, WE WERE PRETTY MUCH IN THE VERY SAME POINT, WITH OUR DEVICE STILL RUNNING WINDOWS 8 AND STILL UNABLE TO UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 10. SO WE DECIDED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH MICROSOFT SUPPORT. AFTER 30 MINUTES OF CHATTING AND A REMOTE CONTROL SESSION, WE'RE CONNECTED TO A LEVEL 2 TECHNICIAN BECAUSE, SOMEHOW, OUR PROBLEM NEEDS A MORE IN-DEPTH LOOK AT SYSTEM FILES. IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO CONTACT MICROSOFT SUPPORT, YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT IT'S ALL A BIG PAIN IN THE NECK, SO WE ENDED UP TRYING TO FIX THE ISSUE ON OUR OWN. AND WE DID MANAGE TO DO THAT WITH THE MEDIA CREATION TOOL, A FORCED UPDATE TO WINDOWS 8.1, ANOTHER GAZILLION OF UPDATES TO PREPARE THE SYSTEM FOR WINDOWS 10, AND FINALLY, THE UPGRADE ITSELF TO WINDOWS 10. FOUR DAYS LATER, WE MANAGED TO GET WINDOWS 10 UP AND RUNNING. WINDOWS 10 RUNNING ON SONY VAIO PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE AFTER SO MANY DAYS TRYING TO INSTALL WINDOWS 10, WE CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO SOMEONE WITH LIMITED COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE OR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME OR THE PATIENCE TO DIAGNOSE ALL THESE ERRORS. WE'VE RECEIVED THE ANSWER FROM ONE OF OUR READERS: PIRATE WINDOWS 10. AFTER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE LOGIC BEHIND THIS REASON, WE GOT IT. AND HE REALLY DOES HAVE A POINT HERE. WHY TRY SO HARD WHEN YOU CAN CLEAN-INSTALL WINDOWS 10 AND USE IT IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY (FOR MICROSOFT)? IGNORANCE MIGHT ACTUALLY HURT WINDOWS 10. AS AWFUL AS IT MAY SOUND FOR SOME, IT'S EXTREMELY EASY TO BYPASS WINDOWS 10 ACTIVATION AND GET A PIRATED COPY RUNNING ON YOUR COMPUTER IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK. INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO DO THAT ARE SO DETAILED THAT EVEN YOUR GRANDMA CAN DO IT. SO BASICALLY, GIVEN ALL OF THE ABOVE, WE HAVE TWO CATEGORIES OF USERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING ISSUES WITH WINDOWS 10: THOSE WHO CANNOT ACTIVATE THE NEW OS AND THOSE WHO COME ACROSS SO MANY UPGRADE ISSUES AND DON'T WANT TO CLEAN-INSTALL BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THEY COULD LOSE THEIR LICENSE. IN BOTH CASES, A CLEAN INSTALL OF WINDOWS 10 THAT CAN FIX ANY OTHER TIME WASTING ISSUE AND A ONE-CLICK METHOD TO BYPASS ACTIVATION COULD BECOME A SOLUTION, AND BY SIMPLY IGNORING ALL PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY ITS USERS, MICROSOFT MIGHT ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO GO IN THE WRONG WAY. WINDOWS 10 NEEDS EVERYTHING TO RUN SMOOTHLY, AND AFTER SPENDING SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO UPGRADE A DEVICE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT THE NEW OS IN FULL, IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT NOT EVERYONE IS WILLING TO WASTE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF HOURS TO INSTALL IT. SO BEFORE ANYTHING, IF MICROSOFT WANTS ITS USERS TO GO GENUINE, IT MUST MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO INSTALL AND ACTIVATE WINDOWS 10 LEGITIMATELY. OTHERWISE, THE NUMBER OF USERS TEMPTED TO GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION MIGHT BE GROWING.
624	IN 2011 SFFS DEBT WAS $112 MILLION BUT IT BALLOONED TO $387M. AN AGGRESSIVE REPAYMENT PLAN WAS EXPECTED THIS YEAR TO SHRINK IT TO ABOUT $150 MILLION. SFF CHAIRMAN ROB HEWETT SAID THE MARKET PANICKED TO SECURE LAMBS FOLLOWING THAT HORROR SNOWSTORM BUT BY JANUARY 2012 PRICES COLLAPSED AND MARKETS SLOWED, LEADING TO A MASSIVE BUILD-UP OF INVENTORY. THAT INVENTORY HAD TO BE FUNDED, LEAVING SFF, IN PARTICULAR, BADLY EXPOSED. COLLECTIVELY, THE MEAT INDUSTRY LOST $200M THAT YEAR, HE SAID. SFF WAS ALSO COMMITTED TO REBUILDING ITS FIRE-DAMAGED TE AROHA BEEF WORKS, DECIDING TO INVEST $30M MORE THAN THE INSURANCE PAYOUT TO MAKE IT A STATE-OF-THE-ART PLANT. IT ALSO TRIED TO LOCK IN SUPPLY BY OFFERING FARMERS WHAT PROVED TO BE GENEROUS, LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR SHEEP MEAT AND BULL BEEF. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS CONTRACTING SUPPLY COST SFF $50M. THOSE COMMITMENTS HAVE FINALLY BEEN WOUND DOWN. OTHER COMMENTATORS ALSO POINT TO THE PROTRACTED AND BITTER 2004 BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF RICHMOND WHICH COST $150M AND CREATED AN ABUNDANCE OF ANIMOSITY AMONG NORTH ISLAND FARMERS. WHILE DEBT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE, HEWETT SAID A REVIEW IDENTIFIED ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE AS A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY. SPECIFICALLY, BANKS WANTED A STRONGER DEBT-EQUITY RATIO BECAUSE OF THEIR RISK EXPOSURE. HEWETT SAID THE ASSOCIATED UNCERTAINTY EVERY YEAR AFFECTED STAFF MORALE, CONFIDENCE AND THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND PLANS. THE MOVE TO CONSUMER-READY PRODUCTS IN ITS PLATE TO PASTURE STRATEGY HAS ALSO BEEN COSTLY AND WHILE SALES CONTRIBUTE 5% OF REVENUE, IT HAS BEEN A LONG PROCESS REQUIRING ONGOING INVESTMENT OF UP TO $4M A YEAR. SFF HAS TWICE PREVIOUSLY SOUGHT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO REDUCE DEBT, FUND NEW TECHNOLOGY AND ITS PLATE TO PASTURE CONSUMER RETAIL PACK STRATEGY. IN 2008 SHAREHOLDERS AGREED TO SELL HALF THE COMPANY TO PGG WRIGHTSON IN A $220M DEAL BROKERED BY THE LATE CRAIG NORGATE AND TWO DUNEDIN BUSINESS BROTHERS BAIRD AND ALAN MCCONNON. ONE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT MOST BANKS DO NOT WANT TO LEND TERM DEBT TO MEAT COMPANIES. ROSS HYLAND MIE THE DEAL WOULD HAVE SEEN PGG WRIGHTSON TAKE A HALF SHARE IN THE COMPANY AND SOURCE STOCK FOR SFF, ALLOWING THE MEAT CO-OPERATIVE TO RETIRE DEBT, SAVING IT $20M A YEAR IN INTEREST COSTS, AND INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGY AND MARKETING. BUT THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS INTERVENED AND PGG WRIGHTSON COULDNT RAISE THE MONEY. A SETTLEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED IN WHICH PGG WRIGHTSON PAID SFF $25M AND ISSUED IT WITH 10M ORDINARY SHARES. IRONICALLY, THE MONEY WAS SOURCED FROM SOUTH CANTERBURY FINANCE, WHICH LATER COLLAPSED BECAUSE OF DEBT. A YEAR LATER SFF WENT TO SHAREHOLDERS WITH A NEW CAPITAL STRUCTURE OFFER, SEEKING $80M BUT HOPING FOR $128M. IT SECURED JUST $22M. THE FUNDS WOULD HAVE RETIRED $70M IN MATURING BONDS AND ALLOWED INVESTMENT OF BETWEEN $25M AND $30M FOR X-RAY CARCASE IMAGING AND ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGY. ON AT LEAST TWO OCCASIONS SERIOUS CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO A MERGER WITH ALLIANCE GROUP. SFF WALKED AWAY FROM MERGER TALKS WITH ALLIANCE IN 2007 WHEN THE INVERCARGILL CO-OPERATIVE VALUED SFF AT VIRTUALLY NOTHING. A YEAR LATER SFF WALKED AWAY AGAIN FROM A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD HAVE LOCKED UP ABOUT 80% OF THE NATIONS RED MEAT PROCESSING SAYING CONCESSIONS ALLOWING OTHER COMPANIES TO EXEMPT PRODUCT WOULD HAVE UNDERMINED ITS EFFECTIVENESS. THAT LACK OF PROFITABILITY AND PERCEIVED RISK PLAGUES THE MEAT INDUSTRY AND LIMITS ITS ABILITY TO SECURE LONG-TERM FUNDING, MEAT INDUSTRY EXCELLENCE ADVISER ROSS HYLAND SAYS. ONE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT MOST BANKS DO NOT WANT TO LEND TERM DEBT TO MEAT COMPANIES. AS A RESULT COMPANIES WERE LIMITED IN WHERE THEY COULD SOURCE FUNDING AND WERE FORCED TO PAY PREMIUM INTEREST RATES, HE SAID. BECAUSE OF ITS SCALE, LACK OF RISK BY HAVING CONTRACTED SUPPLY AND GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS, INVESTORS VIEWED FONTERRA DIFFERENTLY AND IT WASNT RELIANT ON TRADING BANKS BUT COULD GET FUNDING, SUCH AS BONDS, FROM INTERNATIONAL EQUITY MARKETS. HYLAND SAID UNPAID SEASONAL FINANCE WAS OFTEN ROLLED OVER INTO TERM DEBT WHICH WAS PAID DOWN IN A GOOD YEAR BUT LOW MARGINS MEANT IT BUILT UP AGAIN.

627	U.S. SPACE AGENCY NASA ANNOUNCED ON MONDAY IT HAS FOUND "STRONG" EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS LIQUID WATER INTERMITTENTLY FLOWING ON PRESENT-DAY MARS. IMAGES TAKEN FROM THE MARS ORBIT SHOWED DARK, FINGER-LIKE MARKINGS THAT, TYPICALLY LESS THAN FIVE METERS IN WIDTH, APPEAR ON SLOPES DURING WARM SEASONS, LENGTHEN AND THEN FADE DURING COOLER SEASONS ON THE RED PLANET. THESE SURFACE FEATURES, KNOWN AS RECURRING SLOPE LINEAE (RSL), HAVE BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO FORM BY THE ACTIVITY OF BRINES, BUT DIRECT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN LACKING. NOW, USING AN IMAGING SPECTROMETER FROM NASA'S MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER (MRO), RESEARCHERS DETECTED SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED MINERALS ON SLOPES WHERE THE MYSTERIOUS STREAKS ARE SEEN ON MARS. "OUR QUEST ON MARS HAS BEEN TO 'FOLLOW THE WATER,' IN OUR SEARCH FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, AND NOW WE HAVE CONVINCING SCIENCE THAT VALIDATES WHAT WE'VE LONG SUSPECTED," SAID JOHN GRUNSFELD, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR OF NASA'S SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE IN WASHINGTON. "THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT, AS IT APPEARS TO CONFIRM THAT WATER -- ALBEIT BRINY -- IS FLOWING TODAY ON THE SURFACE OF MARS." THESE PUZZLING SURFACE FEATURES WERE FIRST NOTICED IN 2010 BY LUJENDRA OJHA, THEN A UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT, USING IMAGES FROM THE MRO'S HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGING SCIENCE EXPERIMENT. IN THE NEW STUDY, OJHA, NOW A GRADUATE STUDENT AT GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, AND HIS COLLEAGUES ANALYZED SPECTRA DATA FROM THE COMPACT RECONNAISSANCE IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR MARS (CRISM) ABOARD THE MRO FROM FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHERE THE RSL FEATURES WERE PRESENT. THEY REPORTED IN THE BRITISH JOURNAL NATURE GEOSCIENCE THAT SIGNATURES OF HYDRATED SALTS AT THESE RSL LOCATIONS EXISTED ONLY WHEN THE DARK FEATURES WERE RELATIVELY WIDE. "WE FOUND THE HYDRATED SALTS ONLY WHEN THE SEASONAL FEATURES WERE WIDEST, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT EITHER THE DARK STREAKS THEMSELVES OR A PROCESS THAT FORMS THEM IS THE SOURCE OF THE HYDRATION," OJHA SAID. "IN EITHER CASE, THE DETECTION OF HYDRATED SALTS ON THESE SLOPES MEANS THAT WATER PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THESE STREAKS." THE RESEARCHERS INTERPRETED THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES AS CAUSED BY HYDRATED MINERALS CALLED PERCHLORATES, WHICH ARE LIKELY A MIXTURE OF MAGNESIUM PERCHLORATE, MAGNESIUM CHLORATE AND SODIUM PERCHLORATE. SOME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO KEEP LIQUIDS FROM FREEZING EVEN WHEN CONDITIONS ARE AS COLD AS MINUS 94 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT (MINUS 70 CELSIUS), NASA SAID. ON EARTH, NATURALLY PRODUCED PERCHLORATES ARE CONCENTRATED IN DESERTS, AND SOME TYPES OF PERCHLORATES CAN BE USED AS ROCKET PROPELLANT. PERCHLORATES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEEN ON MARS. FOR EXAMPLE, NASA'S PHOENIX LANDER AND CURIOSITY ROVER BOTH FOUND THEM IN THE PLANET'S SOIL, AND SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THAT THE VIKING MISSIONS IN THE 1970S MEASURED SIGNATURES OF THESE SALTS. "HOWEVER, THIS STUDY OF RSL DETECTED PERCHLORATES, NOW IN HYDRATED FORM, IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAN THOSE EXPLORED BY THE LANDERS," NASA SAID. "THIS ALSO IS THE FIRST TIME PERCHLORATES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM ORBIT." FOR OJHA, THE NEW FINDINGS ARE MORE PROOF THAT THE MYSTERIOUS LINES HE FIRST SAW DARKENING MARTIAN SLOPES FIVE YEARS AGO ARE, INDEED, PRESENT-DAY WATER. "WHEN MOST PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WATER ON MARS, THEY'RE USUALLY TALKING ABOUT ANCIENT WATER OR FROZEN WATER," HE SAID. "NOW WE KNOW THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY. THIS IS THE FIRST SPECTRAL DETECTION THAT UNAMBIGUOUSLY SUPPORTS OUR LIQUID WATER-FORMATION HYPOTHESES FOR RSL."
628	PEYTON MANNING'S SUMMER WAS BOTH DAZZLING AND PERPLEXING. PRACTICES CONSISTED OF SPRINT-OUTS, ROLL-OUTS AND BOOTLEGS FROM UNDER CENTER, PLAY-ACTION PASSES FROM THE PISTOL FORMATION AND SCRAMBLES FOR FIRST DOWNS IN DEFIANCE OF HIS 39-YEAR-OLD LEGS. PRESEASON GAMES WERE FILLED WITH EMPTY BACKFIELDS AND SHOTGUN FORMATIONS THAT PRODUCED A PAUCITY OF POINTS AND PLENTY OF ANGST AMONG BRONCOS FANS AND FANTASY FOOTBALL OWNERS ALIKE. WHICH MANNING SHOWS UP SUNDAY IS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE. "THE LAST THREE YEARS HE'S BEEN HERE, THERE WERE (PRESEASON) GAMES WE DIDN'T SCORE POINTS AND WE'D COME OUT AND SCORE 35, 42 POINTS" IN THE OPENER, WIDE RECEIVER DEMARYIUS THOMAS SAID. "SO, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BY DESIGN OR NOT, BUT IT HAPPENS." IF MANNING IS CONCERNED THAT HE DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN AUGUST, HE DIDN'T SHOW IT WEDNESDAY. "HEY, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SUNDAY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM," MANNING SAID. "WE'VE GOT SOME NEW GUYS PLAYING AND WE'VE GOT SOME NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO. I'VE SAID ALL ALONG THE KEY FOR US IS TO IMPROVE THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF A GAME. "BALTIMORE'S AN EXCELLENT DEFENSE. ARE YOU GOING TO DOMINATE ALL FOUR QUARTERS? I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S EVER DONE THAT AGAINST BALTIMORE, BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WIN ENOUGH PLAYS AND BE EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO WIN THE FOOTBALL GAME." RAVENS COACH JOHN HARBAUGH SAID ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES HE'S FACING THIS WEEK AS HE PREPARES FOR THE OPENER WAS FIGURING OUT HOW BRONCOS COACH GARY KUBIAK, HIS FORMER OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WAS ADAPTING HIS SCHEME TO FIT MANNING'S SKILLS.  "I'M SURE THAT THEY DIDN'T SHOW IN THE PRESEASON EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE PLANNING ON DOING." THE BRONCOS SHOWED ALMOST NOTHING IN THE PRESEASON, IN PART BECAUSE MANNING NEVER HAD PRO BOWL RECEIVERS THOMAS AND EMMANUEL SANDERS TOGETHER WITH HIM ON THE FIELD. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO USE TRAINING CAMP TO GET A FEEL FOR THE FUTURE. GENERAL MANAGER JOHN ELWAY SAID HE LIKED WHAT HE SAW IN BROCK OSWEILER, WHO'S ENTERING HIS FOURTH SEASON AS MANNING'S BACKUP.  STILL DONT HAVE THOSE. HE ALSO LIKED ROOKIE TREVOR SIEMIAN, SO MUCH SO THAT HE HAD TO KEEP THE FORMER NORTHWESTERN QB ON THE 53-MAN ROSTER RATHER THAN RISK TRYING TO SLIP HIM THROUGH TO THE PRACTICE SQUAD. MANNING MADE CAMEOS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD EXHIBITION GAMES AND DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN NINE FULL POSSESSIONS.  "WHILE ALL EYES WILL BE ON APPLE'S NEW PRODUCTS, I WOULD SUGGEST PEOPLE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CURRENT IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS MARKET PERFORMANCE, SHOULD THE ACCUSTOMED PRICE DROP OCCUR AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 9 PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT," MILANESE SAID. HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PLAYED MORE AND BETTER BUT WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS PREPARATION FOR HIS 18TH NFL SEASON. HARBAUGH MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO EXPECT SUNDAY, BUT HE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF KUBIAK AND HIS TOP LIEUTENANT, RICK DENNISON, LAST YEAR, RAVENS QUARTERBACK JOE FLACCO HAD THE BEST SEASON OF HIS SEVEN-YEAR CAREER. "I'M SURE THAT PEYTON IS HAVING A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM," FLACCO SAID. "... THEY JUST HELPED ME PLAY FAST, PLAY WITH A QUIET MIND, BE CONFIDENT AND MAKE QUICK DECISIONS.  BUT I DO PREFER WHEN THE CUBS AND CARDINALS ARE BOTH GOOD, AND ITS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN 2015, THOUGH SHOULD WE BE SURPRISED? I THINK THAT OUR LINE PLAYED REALLY WELL LAST YEAR UNDER THEIR PROTECTION SCHEME AND I THINK THAT HELPED OUT A TON." THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR MANNING, WHO HAS FOUR NEW O-LINEMEN, INCLUDING TWO NOVICES IN LEFT TACKLE TY SAMBRAILO AND CENTER MATT PARADIS. RAVENS RUNNING BACK JUSTIN FORSETT WENT FROM JOURNEYMAN TO PRO BOWLER IN KUBIAK'S ZONE BLOCKING SCHEME LAST YEAR, AND HARBAUGH SAID DENVER PRO BOWLER C.J. ANDERSON SHOULD BE IN FOR A SIMILARLY SPECTACULAR SEASON. "HE'S A DOWNHILL, ONE-CUT, VERY PHYSICAL GUY," HARBAUGH SAID. "DIFFERENT KINDS OF BACKS ARE GOOD IN THIS SCHEME, BUT THEY'VE GOT TWO OF THEM. RONNIE HILLMAN DOES IT DIFFERENTLY THAN C.J.  I THINK THEY'VE GOT TWO GUYS WITH DIFFERENT STYLES THAT RUN THE SCHEME VERY WELL." NOTES: PLAYERS VOTED MANNING, DE DEMARCUS WARE AND S DAVID BRUTON JR. AS TEAM CAPTAINS. ... DE KENNY ANUNIKE (KNEE) WAS THE ONLY PLAYER TO SIT OUT PRACTICE. --- AP NFL WEBSITE: WWW.PRO32.AP.ORG AND WWW.TWITTER.COM/AP-NFL
629	TEXT SIZE - + SCIENTISTS ARE LEARNING A BIT MORE ABOUT BAT HUNTING HABITS. THEY'VE CREATED THE FIRST VISUAL IMAGES FROM ECHOLOCATION TO SHOW HOW THESE NOCTURNAL CREATURES SENSE THEIR WORLD. (NOT PICTURED) (PHOTO : FLICKR/ANNE BROOKE, USFWS) SCIENTISTS ARE LEARNING A BIT MORE ABOUT BAT HUNTING HABITS. THEY'VE CREATED THE FIRST VISUAL IMAGES FROM ECHOLOCATION TO SHOW HOW THESE NOCTURNAL CREATURES SENSE THEIR WORLD. LIKE US ON FACEBOOK MOST BATS HUNT BY DETECTING THE MOVEMENT OF FLYING INSECTS USING ECHOLOCATION. ONLY A THIRD OF ALL BAT SPECIES ARE ABLE TO HUNT FOR PREY ON SURFACES. PREVIOUS STUDIES, THEREFORE, HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BATS MUST DETECT PREY BY SIGHT, SMELL AND SOUND. IN THIS LATEST STUDY, THOUGH, THE RESEARCHERS SUGGEST THAT INSTEAD OF SEARCHING FOR PREY DIRECTLY, BATS INTIMATELY LEARN THE LAYOUT OF A HOME RANGE-DOWN TO THE SURFACE OF INDIVIDUAL LEAVES AND STONES. WHEN ONE OF THESE FAMILIAR LEAVES IS COVERED BY AN INSECT, THE NORMAL ECHOES ARE INTERRUPTED AND THIS "ACOUSTIC SHADOW" IS A VERY STRONG SIGNAL TO A HUNTING BAT. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE COMMON BIG-EARED BAT MICRONYCTERIS MICROTIS, A NEOTROPIOCAL SPECIES FROM SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA, HAS BEEN FOUND TO USE ECHOLOCATION ALONE. SCIENTISTS HAVE SPECULATED THAT BY HOVERING BESIDE PREY, THIS SPECIES BOMBARDS IT AND THE SURFACE ON WHICH IT RESTS WITH SHORT SOUND WAVES. BY CONTINUALLY CHANGING THEIR ANGLE OF SCANNING, THE PREY BECOMES EASIER TO PICK OUT. IN THIS LATEST STUDY, THE RESEARCHERS DEVELOPED A NEW IMAGING TECHNIQUE TO ALLOW THEM TO ENTER THE BAT'S WORLD VIEW. THEY BUILT FOUR ACOUSTIC CUES INTO THE SYSTEM, COMBINING THE DURATION AND AMPLITUDE OF ECHOES WITH THE DEPTH PROFILE OF OBJECTS AND THE STRENGTH OF THE SHADOW CAST BY INSECTS. "USING INFORMATION LIKE X-RAYS TO BUILD PICTURES IS WELL ESTABLISHED IN MEDICINE WITH THE USE OF CT SCANS AND ULTRASOUND, BUT NO ONE HAS EVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED TO CREATE IMAGES FROM SOUNDS GENERATED IN ECOLOGY," SAID ELIZABETH CLARE, ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS, IN A NEWS RELEASE. THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THE ACOUSTIC CUES AVAILABLE TO BATS TO DETECT MOTIONLESS PREY DON'T IMPROVE GREATLY IF THE PROFILE OF THE INSECT SEEMS TO STAND OUT MORE. INSTEAD, IT SEEMS AS IF IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO THE KIND OF SURFACE ON WHICH THE INSECT RESTS. FOR EXAMPLE, INSECTS ARE EASIER TO "SEE" ON SLATE AND SMOOTH LEAVES RATHER THAN ON ROUGH BARK. "OUR FINDINGS ALSO SUGGEST A NEW PHENOMENON OF ACOUSTIC CAMOUFLAGE, WHERE INSECTS ARE HARDER TO DISCERN ON ROUGH SURFACE SUCH AS BARK AND BATS COMPENSATE FOR THIS BY FOCUSING THEIR ATTENTION ON THE SIMPLER, MIRROR-LIKE SURFACES IN THEIR PATCH," SAID CLARE. THE FINDINGS ARE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY. RELATED STORIES FOR MORE GREAT SCIENCE STORIES AND GENERAL NEWS, PLEASE VISIT OUR SISTER SITE, HEADLINES AND GLOBAL NEWS (HNGN).

633	HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED HOW PEOPLE WHO LIVE, WORK AND STUDY IN LONDON USE SOCIAL MEDIA? IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH LONDON? DO MORE FEMALES USE SNAPCHAT THAN MALES? WE THOUGHT THE SAME AND DECIDED TO FIND OUT THE ANSWER FOR OURSELVES! LINK HUMANS, TOGETHER WITH SOCIAL MEDIA LONDON SURVEYED PEOPLE WHO WORK AND LIVE IN LONDON AND ASKED QUESTIONS BASED ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT CATEGORIES: TRAVEL RELATIONSHIPS FOOD WORD FASHION SOCIAL MEDIA BRANDS WE THOUGHT THAT BY PROVIDING THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, WE COULD FIND OUT WHY CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE USING SOCIAL MEDIA, IF THERE ARE COMMON TRENDS AND HOW THIS CAN HELP BRANDS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS IN THE FUTURE FOR CONTENT AND TARGETING PURPOSES. SO, WHO REALLY IS USING SOCIAL MEDIA IN LONDON AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SOCIAL SECRETS THAT WE FOUND OUT? SOCIAL MEDIA IN TERMS OF PRIVACY, WE DISCOVERED THAT IN LONDON,51% OF FEMALES PREFER TO USE A PRIVATE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT, WHEREAS ONLY 28.21% OF MALES WOULD USE PRIVATE ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION TO THIS, WE WANTED TO FIND OUT LONDONS FAVOURITE SOCIAL NETWORK.TWITTER RANKED FIRST AS FAVOURITE SOCIAL NETWORK IN OUR SURVEY, INSTAGRAM CAME SECOND AND FACEBOOK RANKED 3RD. IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE THE RISE OF THE VISUAL NETWORK AND HOW POPULAR IT IS IN COMPARISON TO FACEBOOK. ON THE TOPIC OF VISUAL NETWORKS, WE ALSO WANTED TO DISCOVER RESPONDENTS FAVOURITE SOCIAL NETWORK FOR VIDEO, 71.67% OF RESPONDENTS CHOSE YOUTUBE AS THEIR FAVOURITE. AN INTERESTING STATISTIC WAS HOW POPULAR SNAPCHAT IS AMONGST CERTAIN AGE GROUPS. WE FOUND THAT 35.71% OF 18-24 YEAR OLDS USE SNAPCHAT DAILY AND THIS WAS THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OUT OF ANY OF THE POSSIBLE AGE GROUPS. BRANDS IT WAS IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT TAKEAWAYS FOR BRANDS FROM THIS STUDY. BRANDS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO TARGET AND ENGAGE WITH CERTAIN AUDIENCES, TO DO THAT THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEIR AUDIENCE WANT FROM THEM ON SOCIAL NETWORKS. WE FOUND THAT75.83% OF RESPONDENTS FOLLOW BRANDS FOR INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING CONTENT AND PROMOTIONS AND DISCOUNTS CAME NEXT IN TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE WANT FROM BRANDS. WHAT WASNT SO POPULAR WAS JOB LISTINGS AND PARTICIPATING IN DISCUSSIONS WHICH ONLY 16.67%SAID THEY WANTED FROM BRANDS. PERHAPS BRANDS NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON VARIED CONTENT THAT IS ENTERTAINING FOR VARIOUS GROUPS OF PEOPLE. SHAREABLE CONTENT IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT! 52.38% OF 18-24 YEAR OLDS CONSIDER COMPETITIONS TO BE IMPORTANT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHEN IT COMES TO BRANDS, SO PERHAPS THIS IS THE WAY TO ATTRACT MILLENNIALS AND A YOUNGER GENERATION. POLITICS AND EVENTS WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AT NETWORKING EVENTS AND HOW SOCIAL MEDIA IS INCORPORATED INTO THAT COMMUNICATION. SURPRISINGLY, WE FOUND THAT71.54% OF PEOPLE WOULD GIVE OUT THEIR TWITTER HANDLE AT AN EVENT AND 62.60% WOULD GIVE OUT THEIR EMAIL! LINKEDIN WAS NOT IN THE TOP 2 ALTHOUGH MANY MAY HAVE EXPECTED IT TO BE. HOWEVER, 90.23% OF RESPONDENTS SAID THEY WOULD DEFINITELY CONNECT ON LINKEDIN AFTER AN EVENT. WORK SOCIAL MEDIA AND WORK ARE MERGING MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. NOT ONLY HAS THERE BEEN AN INCREASE IN JOBS IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA INDUSTRY, PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA AT WORK FOR BOTH WORK PURPOSES AND TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES. THIS IS PROVEN THROUGH THE RESULTS WE GATHERED IN OUR SURVEY:73.23% OF RESPONDENTS SPEND 1 HOUR+ AT WORK DAILY AND88.55% USE SOCIAL MEDIA FOR WORK PURPOSES. IN TERMS OF WHAT LONDONERS WANT FROM BRANDS THAT THEY WISH TO WORK FOR IN THE FUTURE89.13% OF FEMALES EXPECT JOB LISTINGS ON SOCIAL MEDIA FROM POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS AND 44.57% EXPECT INTERVIEW TIPS. PERHAPS BRANDS SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF THIS, IT COULD BE A WAY TO RECRUIT MORE POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES IF THEY ARE BEING GIVEN WHAT THEY ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING FROM CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, IN ADDITION TO THIS, 92.31% OF 18-24 YEAR OLDS USE FACEBOOK AT UNIVERSITY SO THIS NETWORK WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO RECRUIT AND CREATE JOB POSTINGS.

634	INNOV8TIV INNOV8TIV - BLACKS IN TECHNOLOGY IN USA, UK, CARIBBEAN ISLANDS & AFRICA NIGERIA HAS A COLLECTIVE BANDWIDTH CAPACITY OF MORE THAN 19 TERABYTES, WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, THE SUBMARINE CABLES BROUGHT IN BY THE MAINONE, WACS, AND GLO 1 AMONG OTHER INTERNET PLAYERS. ALL THESE BROADBAND INVESTMENTS WERE MADE IN ANTICIPATION THAT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT WILL ENCOURAGE THE PENETRATION OF BROADBAND USAGE TO ABOUT 30% BY THE YEAR 2017. HOWEVER, THE PENETRATION RATE HAS BEEN QUITE LOW, AND STAKEHOLDERS ARE ALREADY CONCERNED. THE CURRENT BROADBAND PENETRATION IN NIGERIA STANDS AT 10%, DESPITE THE COUNTRYS GREAT CAPABILITY. OVER THE LAST WEEKEND, TWO FORUMS WERE HELD WHERE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF GOVERNMENT PUSH TO FAST-TRACK THE ADOPTION OF BROADBAND ACROSS NIGERIA WERE DISCUSSED. THE TWO FORUMS WERE THE NIGERIA INTERNET GROUP (NIG) UNDER THE THEME: INTERNET PENETRATION: THE WAY FORWARD AND THE NIGERIA INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY REPORTERS ASSOCIATION (NITRA) WHICH HELD ITS QUARTERLY SEMINAR UNDER THE THEME: FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AN IMPETUS TO ACHIEVING UBIQUITOUS BROADBAND PENETRATION . ALL THESE FORUMS CENTERED ON THE DISCUSSIONS LOOKING AT VARIOUS WAYS TO REMOVE OBSTACLES PREVENTING HIGHER RATE OF BROADBAND PENETRATION. THE STAKEHOLDERS DESCRIBED THE RATE AS SNAIL SPEED DEVELOPMENT FROWNING AT THE AWKWARD RATE OF PENETRATION REGISTERED IN THE FEW PAST MONTHS. THEY SAY THAT THE MULTIPLE TAXATIONS, DEGRADATION OF THE NAIRA AND THE STATES GOVERNMENT MOVE TO INSTALL FIBER OPTIC CABLES THROUGH THE FEDERATION TO BE CAUSING THE SNAIL-PACED BROADBAND PENETRATION RATE. THEY URGED THE STATE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO LINK UP THE FIBRE OPTIC. ACCORDING TO THEM, THIS MOVE WILL HELP THEM GENERATE MORE REVENUE, AND THE ECONOMYS GDP WILL INCREASE. EMMANUEL EKWUEM, THE CEO AT TELEDOM GROUP AND THE CHAIRMAN AT THE OCCASION SAID: OUR CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION SHOULD BE PUT TO WORK IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE CONTENT ALSO NEEDS TO BE SCRUTINIZED. ACCORDING TO EKWUEM, NIGERIA NEEDS TO CHECK ON THE TYPE OF CONTENT THAT WILL BE PRODUCED AND THE IMPACT THEY WILL HAVE ON THE DAILY LIVES OF THE USERS. GBENGA ADEBAYO THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF LICENSED TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATORS OF NIGERIA (ALTON) THROUGH REPRESENTATION SHARED HIS SKEPTICISM ON BROADBAND PENETRATION GOING FAR GIVEN THE CURRENT CHALLENGES BEDEVILING THE SECTOR.

635	VERY OFTEN, WHEN IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT PENTAX CAMERAS YOU'LL HEAR THE PHRASE: 'IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO SPORT PHOTOGRAPHY THIS CAMERA (K-30) IS EXCELLENT FOR YOU' ANDI AM ALWAYS SURPRISED BY THIS PHRASE. I TAKE PHOTOS OF MANY TYPES OF SPORT COMPETITIONS: FOOTBALL, BEACH VOLLEYBALL, FIGHTING, ATHLETICS, CLASSIC RALLY, DRIFT, RALLY-RAID, MOTO-CROSS, FREESTYLE-MOTOCROSS AND STUNT-RIDING, TO NAME A FEW. FROM THE START OF MY CAREER I USED PENTAX EQUIPMENT, BEGINNING WITH THE K20D AS WELL AS THE K-01 AND 645D AND NOW I USE A BLUE PENTAX K-30 FOR TAKING MY SHOTS. RECENTLY I HAD THE CHANCE TO TEST THIS INEXPENSIVE AND RELIABLE CAMERA IN VERY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS AND FOR MY EFFORTS I RECEIVED ACCREDITATION AT THE WORLD SUPERBIKE STAGE. ON THE SATURDAY OF THE SHOOT, THE RACE CIRCUIT AT THE MOSCOW RACEWAY WAS COVERED BY CLOUD BUT IT SOON GOT A LOT WORSE WHEN SUNDAY ARRIVED. DRIZZLING RAIN WHICH BEGAN ON THE FIRST LAP OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS SUPERBIKES HIT THE TRACK AND IT SOON BECAME REALLY HEAVY RAINFALL! HOWEVER, LUCKILY, THIS WAS NO BIG PROBLEM FOR ME! I'VE GOTTEN USED TO RAIN AND IT GAVEME A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THE QUALITY OF THE DUST-PROOFING AND WATERPROOFING OF THE K-30. AS I EXPECTED, THE MOISTURE PROTECTION OF THE CAMERA PROVED TO BE EXCELLENT. I WAS SHOOTING IN THE RAIN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND HAD NO PROBLEMS. ON A SIDE NOTE, THE REASON WHY I WASATTRACTED TO THIS CAMERA IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS BECAUSE OF ITS 16MP SENSOR THAT ALSO FEATURES IN MY K-5. I ALSOREALLY LIKE THE AGGRESSIVE SPORTY DESIGN THE CAMERA HAS SO ALL-IN-ALL, THE CAMERA WAS WORTH LOOKING AT. PLUS NOW, AFTER SHOOTING SUPERBIKE COMPETITIONS, IT'S BEEN CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS THE CAMERA FOR ME. I MUST ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW COMPACT ANDLIGHT WEIGHT THIS MODEL IS. EVEN WITH A 400MM LENS ATTACHED, THIS CAMERA DOESN'T WEAR YOU OUT WHEN SHOOTING ALL DAY. IT ALSO HAS A VERY COMFORTABLE GRIP. WORKING IN AUTOFOCUS MODE WITH AF TRACKING AND CONTINUOUS SHOOTINGWAS VERY EASY! THE CAMERA DID EVERYTHING ITSELF AND WHETHER THE SUBJECT WAS MOVING PARALLEL TO OR AWAY FROM THE CAMERA, THE RESULT WAS THE SAME. THE CAMERA IS ACCURATE, WITH VIRTUALLY ERROR-FREE FOCUS. AND EVEN WHEN THE RAIN CLOSED IN, THE CAMERA STILL WORKED WITHOUT ERROR. IT ALSO PERFORMED WELL AT HIGHER ISO LEVELS, I WAS SHOOTING WITH ISOS AROUND THE 800-1600 MARK,AND ITS OPTICAL STABILIZER ALSO PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN THESE CONDITIONS. CAMERAS WHICH DON'T OFFER THIS STABILIZER AND HAVE POOR QUALITY HIGHER ISOS MAKE MY JOB A LOT HARDER. IT'S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING THE TWO CONTROL WHEELS THE CAMERA HAS AS WITH A RAPID ROTATION OF BOTH, I COULD QUICKLY SET THE DESIRED PARAMETERS WITHOUT TAKING MY EYE FROM THE VIEWFINDER. ALL OF THESE QUALITIES ALLOW ME TO CONCLUDE THAT THE K-30, DESPITE ITS LOW PRICE, ALLOWS ME TO CAPTURE SPORT EVENTS IN THE MOST DIFFICULT OF CONDITIONS.
636	TODAY WE ARE GOING TO BE ENGAGING LATEST TECNO CAMON C8 WITH INFINIX HOTE NOTE BY COMPARISON. NOW BEFORE WE MOVE AHEAD, WE WANT TO STATE IT HERE THAT LOTS OF FOLKS OUT THERE DONT KNOW THAT INFINIX HOT NOTE IS OF 3 SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT HARDWARE VERSIONS. WE HAVE THE FIRST INFINIX HOT NOTE WITH 1GB RAM AND 16GB STORAGE, THEN WE HAVE THE PRO VERSION WITH 2GB RAM AND 32GB STORAGE VERSION AND FINALLY WE HAVE THE LATEST ONE WITH 2GB RAM AND 16GB STORAGE; THOSE ARE THE ONLY SPECS VARIATIONS BETWEEN THOSE 3 INFINIX HOT NOTE, AS EVERY OTHER FEATURES, INCLUDING SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND DESIGN REMAIN THE SAME. NOW WE ARE JAMMING UP THE CAMERA FANTASTIC TECNO CAMON C8 WITH INFINIX HOT NOTE OF 2GB AND 16GB STORAGE VERSION. AS WE NORMALLY DO HERE, WE CONCENTRATE MORE ON THE SPECS VARIATIONS AND WE PICK OUT ONLY THOSE MAJOR DIFFERENCES IN BOTH DEVICES UNDER OUR COMPARISON. TALKING ABOUT THE INFINIX HOT NOTE, I HAVE ONE AROUND ME, AND THEN TALKING ABOUT THE TECNO CAMON C8, MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR AND A GOOD FRIEND HAS IT AND I HAVE HANDLED IT VERY WELL AS MUCH AS I HAVE DONE WITH THE INFINIX HOT NOTE, SO BE REST ASSURED THAT YOU WILL GET A GOOD COMPARISON COMING OUT FROM THE RIGHT SOURCE THAT HAS HANDLED BOTH DEVICES. MUST READ: INNJOO HALO VS INFINIX HOT WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, LETS GO STRAIGHT INTO THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY AND SEE THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE TWO AWESOME DEVICES; THE FIRST DIFFERENCE WE ARE BRINGING TO YOU IS IN THE TYPE OF SIM BOTH DEVICES ARE USING; THE TECNO CAMON C8 USES 1 MINI SIM AND 1 MICRO SIM WHILE THE INFINIX HOT NOTE HAS SIM SLOT SUPPORT FOR DUAL MICRO SIM SECONDLY IS IN THERE PROCESSOR; WHILE WE HAVE THE TECNO CAMON C8 FEATURING 1.3GHZ QUAD-CORE MEDIATEK MT6735 CHIPSET THE INFINIX HOT NOTE ON THE OTHER HAND CAME WITH 1.4GHZ OCTA-CORE MEDIATEK MT6592 PROCESSOR THIRDLY IS THEIR RAM SIZES; CAMON C8 CAME WITH 1GB RAM WHEREAS HOT NOTE FEATURES 2GB RAM COMING DOWN TO CAMERA PIXEL; THE CAMON C8 SPOTS 13MP BACK SHUTTER AND 5MP FRONT CAMERA WHILE THE HOT NOTE FEATURES 8MP AND 2MP BACK AND FRONT CAMERA. THEN TALKING ABOUT THEIR INBUILT OS, THE CAMON 8 CAME WITH ANDROID 5.0 LOLLIPOP WHEREAS THE HOT NOTE IS BUILT WITH ANDROID 4.4.2 KITKAT THOUGH NOW UPGRADABLE TO LOLLIPOP FINALLY IS IN THEIR BATTERY CAPACITY; WHILE WE HAVE THE BACK OF THE CAMON C8 PACKING A 3000MAH LI-PO BATTERY CAPACITY, THE INFINIX HOT NOTE IS PACKING A 4000MAH LI-PO BATTERY CAPACITY. THOSE ARE SIMPLY THE MAJOR VARIATIONS BETWEEN THE TECNO CAMON C8 AND INFINIX HOT NOTE. THEN WE HAVE THE TECNO CAMON C8 CURRENTLY SELLING AT ABOUT $135 (N27000) AND YOU CAN BUY INFINIX HOT NOTE HERE FOR $128 (N25500).
637	DEVO SINGER AND BASSIST GERALD "JERRY"CASALE SAYS HE HAS AN EXPLANATION FOR HIS INAPPROPRIATE WEDDING CAKE AFTER PHOTOS FROM HIS NUPTIALS TO KRISTA NAPP WERE PUBLISHED ONLINE. FANS OF THE 67 YEAR OLD WERE SHOCKED TO DISCOVER THAT THE COUPLE CHOSE TO HAVE THEIR CAKE SHAPED LIKE THE WORLD TRADE CENTER TWIN TOWERS WHEN THEY TIED THE KNOT ON FRIDAY, SEPT. 11. THE PHOTOS OF THE CAKE WHICH ALSO FEATURED CASALE AND NAPPS FACE ON THE TWIN TOWERS WERE POSTED BY TMZ . GUESTS AT THEIR RECEPTION, WHICH WAS HELD AT MICHAELS RESTAURANT IN SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA, REPORTEDLY WERENT SURPRISED BY THE BIZARRE AND OFFENSIVE PASTRY. ONE PERSON IN ATTENDANCE TOLD THE OUTLET THAT CASALE HAS REAL HEART AS AN ARTIST, AND IS A SUPER SWEET GUY. HOWEVER, CASALE IS CLAIMING THAT THE CAKE AT HIS WEDDING WAS A SURPRISE. CASALE, WHO ALSO CO-FOUNDED DEVO, TOOK TO TWITTER TO ISSUE AN APOLOGY AND CLEAR UP ANY RUMORS SURROUNDING HIS WEDDING DAY. HE TWEETED THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE: DEEP APOLOGIES FOR ALL OFFENDED. THERE IS A REAL EXPLANATION AND ITS NOT WHAT YOU THINK. SURPRISE CAKE AND PIX TO TMZ WAS A SET UP. TBC... GERALD CASALE (@GVC3CASALE) SEPTEMBER 15, 2015 THE RECORDING ARTIST ALSO SPOKE TO BILLBOARD ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY, EXPLAINING THE SITUATION IN MORE DETAIL. ACCORDING TO CASALE, THE REASON HE AND NAPP, 26, GOT MARRIED ON THE 14-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS IS BECAUSE THEIR MARRIAGE APPLICATION WAS GOING TO EXPIRE AND THE BEVERLY HILLS COURT HOUSE IS ONLY OPEN FRIDAYS. SO, HOW DID THEY END UP WITH A CAKE OF THE TWIN TOWERS? BEFORE THE CEREMONY, WHICH ONLY INVOLVED THE COUPLE A WITNESS, SOMEONE TOLD CASALE THAT IT WASNT APPROPRIATE FOR THE TWO TO WED ON SEPT. 11. CASALE REPORTEDLY SAID THAT HE AND HIS BRIDE ARE THE TWIN TOWERS OF LOVE. HE TOLD BILLBOARD THAT HE CITED DONALD TRUMP, WHO WANTED TO REBUILD THE TOWERS AT THE SITE AS A F--- YOU TO ANYONE WHO THREATENS OUR WAY OF LIFE OR FREEDOM TO LIVE. A FRIEND ALLEGEDLY OVERHEARD CASALE AND OFFERED TO BRING THE CAKE TO THE RECEPTION, WHICH HAD APPROXIMATELY 20 CLOSE FRIENDS OF THE COUPLE. CASALE AND NAPP DIDNT REALIZE THAT THE CAKE WAS SHAPED LIKE THE TWIN TOWERS UNTIL THEY MOVED INTO ANOTHER ROOM AT THE RESTAURANT FOR DESSERT. CASALE ADDED THAT THEY SPENT THEIR HONEYMOON IN JOSHUA TREE, CALIFORNIA, OVER THE WEEKEND AND DIDNT REALIZE THAT THE PHOTOS FROM THE RECEPTION WERE LEAKED UNTIL MONDAY MORNING. HE BELIEVES THAT ONE OF HIS GUESTS SOLD THE IMAGES TO TMZ, AND SAYS THAT IT RUINED OUR WEDDING.
638	DUBLIN, SEPT. 28, 2015 /PRNEWSWIRE/ -- RESEARCH AND MARKETS (HTTP://WWW.RESEARCHANDMARKETS.COM/RESEARCH/RRWMPN/GLOBAL_FOOD) HAS ANNOUNCED THE ADDITION OF THE REPORT TO THEIR OFFERING. FOOD ADDITIVES WHICH ARE USED TO ENHANCE THE TASTE, COLOR, TEXTURE OF FOOD, SAME TIME MAINTAINING THE FRESHNESS AND NUTRITIONAL CONTENT, ARE EXPECTED TO CROSS US $50 BILLION BY 2020; GROWING AT A CAGR OF 5.5% FROM 2015 AND 2020. THE GLOBAL POPULATION IS GROWING AT A RATE OF 1.14% AND THE INCREASING CALORIE INTAKE PER CAPITA IS LEADING TO SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE GLOBAL FOOD PRODUCTION. GROWING URBANIZATION AND CHANGING LIFESTYLES ARE DRIVING DEMAND FOR CONVENIENCE AND PACKAGED FOODS. THE PACKAGED FOOD INDUSTRY RECORDED US $2.4 TRILLION IN RETAIL SALES FOR THE YEAR 2014. IN THE PROCESSED AND PACKAGED FOODS, ENSURING FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY STARTING FROM TRANSPORTATION TO FARM TO FORK AND STORAGE FACILITIES IS A MAJOR CONCERN. TO MEET THIS DEMAND, FOOD ADDITIVES ARE USED. THE MATURE MARKETS OF DEVELOPED ECONOMIES CONSTITUTE NEARLY 60% OF PROCESSED FOOD MARKET. THIS, IN SPITE OF POPULATION GROWTH RATE NOT EXCEEDING THE GROWTH RATES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE INCREASING DISPOSABLE INCOMES OF THE BURGEONING MIDDLE CLASS IS DRIVING THE SHIFT TOWARDS CONVENIENCE AND PROCESSED FOODS, THUS ESCALATING THE NEED FOR FOOD, THEREBY NEED FOR FOOD ADDITIVES. THE GLOBAL RETAIL AND FOOD SERVICE MARKET WHICH GROSSED SALES OF US $4.4TRILLION IN 2013 IS A MAJOR DRIVER FOR THE FOOD ADDITIVES MARKET DRIVEN MAJORLY BY INCREASED CONSUMER'S EXPOSURE TO PACKAGED FOOD AND BEVERAGES.

639	THE CONTEST WHEN IT COMES TO AEBLESKIVER, JAM IS THE SECRET. NOT NECESSARILY FOR ENHANCING THE TRADITIONAL DANISH PUFF PASTRY TASTE THOUGH IT HELPS BUT FOR MAXIMUM SPEED WHEN INHALING THE RACQUET BALL-SIZED PANCAKE PUFFS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ITS SO DOUGHY, YOU CANT CHEW IT, SAID BRIAN HANRAHAN, A ONE-TIME AEBLESKIVER EATING CONTEST CHAMPION WHO SWEARS BY THE JAM. HE LOST HIS TITLE LAST YEAR WHEN DEFENDING IT AGAINST THE RUNNER-UP FROM 2013. THE RASPBERRY JAM, HANRAHAN CONTENDS, HELPS THE AEBLESKIVER SLIDE DOWN THE THROAT. THATS KEY DURING THE ANNUAL AEBLESKIVER EATING CONTEST AT SOLVANGS DANISH DAYS A BOUT THIS YEAR BETWEEN EIGHT GROWN MEN WHO, WITH THEIR HANDS TIED BEHIND THEIR BACKS, ARE CHALLENGED TO EAT AS MANY OF THE TREATS IN FIVE MINUTES AS POSSIBLE. IT TAKES PLACE TWICE DURING THE FESTIVAL, ONCE FOR ADULTS, AND AGAIN FOR CHILDREN. BY THE END OF THE COMPETITION, MOST WERE BELLYACHING, CAKED IN CONFECTIONERS SUGAR AND STICKY WITH JAM. THEY ALL LOOKED LIKE THEY HAD BEEN IN A TERRIBLE FIGHT, ONE ONLOOKER SAID. AS THE COMPETITION GOT UNDERWAY, SUPPORTIVE WIVES AND GIRLFRIENDS POPPED OPEN CUPS OF JAM AND DRIZZLED THEM ON THE AEBLESKIVER AS THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS ATTACKED THEIR PLATES. MORE JAM! ONE BEARDED CONTESTANT BELLOWED OUT BEFORE A CROWD OF ONLOOKERS. SWALLOW IT WHOLE! ANOTHER YELLED. WHEN HANRAHAN COMPETED, HE DOWNED 11, THE SAME NUMBER AS SATURDAYS REIGNING CHAMP THIS YEAR. ANTON RILEY, THE LOSER OF THE COMPETITION, ATE SEVEN. I ONLY ATE SEVEN, DAD. I FAILED YOU THIS YEAR, RILEY TOLD HIS FATHER. LOCAL TO THE AREA, RILEY HAS BEEN COMING TO DANISH DAYS FOR YEARS. HIS DOWNFALL THIS YEAR, HE SAID, WAS THE LARGE BACON, EGGS AND CORNBREAD BREAKFAST HE HAD THAT MORNING. OR ITS BECAUSE ITS DISGUSTING TO EAT MORE THAN SEVEN AEBLESKIVER IN FIVE MINUTES, HE SAID, AFTER WIPING HIMSELF CLEAN WITH A PAPER TOWEL. PAPA HEINZ IT WOULD SEEM LIKE A STRANGE PAIRING ON DANISH DAYS, TO HAVE A GERMAN PERFORMING DANISH FOLK SONGS. BUT HEINZ TRILCK, OR PAPA HEINZ AS HED RATHER BE KNOWN, DOESNT SWEAT IT. HE POPS A PAPER DANISH FLAG INTO THE RIBBON OF HIS BOWLER CAP, GRABS HIS ACCORDION AND HITS THE STREETS. FROM THE CORNER OF THE COPENHAGEN HOUSE, HE DELIGHTS TOURISTS WHO SADDLE UP BESIDE HIM AND POSE FOR PHOTOS AS HE PUMPS OUT DANISH DITTIES. ONE CHINESE TOURIST WITH A CAMERA STRAPPED AROUND HIS NECK EASED HIMSELF BESIDE PAPA AND BEGAN CLACKING AT HIS KEYS. OH YOU WANT TO PLAY, HEINZ SAID. THE TOURIST BEGAN TOOTING OUT THE STAR WARS THEME AS HEINZ WORKED THE WIND SECTION OF THE ACCORDION, MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF HIS WIFE, WHO STOOD BACK SNAPPING PHOTOS OF THEM ON HER PHONE. A SHOWBOAT, HE RELISHES IN THE ATTENTION BEFORE STARTING TO PLAY LA CUCARACHA. ITS A DANISH TUNE, HE JOKED. SO MANY SONGS MAKE THEIR WAY ALL AROUND THE WORLD. HEINZ BEGAN PLAYING THE ACCORDION 60 YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS 21 YEARS OLD, BUT IT WASNT UNTIL ANOTHER ACCORDION PLAYER RETIRED EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT HE STARTED PLAYING AT DANISH DAYS. THE BEST PART, HEINZ SAID, IS MEETING THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE FESTIVAL YEAR AFTER YEAR. I MEET LITTLE GIRLS WHO ARE THIS TALL, HE SAID, MOTIONING WAIST HIGH. NOW THEYRE BIG, BUT MORE SHY NOW. A ROCKING FLOAT WITH A GUITARIST AND DRUMMER WAILING LED ZEPPELINS IMMIGRANT SONG FROM A PARADE FLOAT FILLED WITH A GROUP OF BEER-POURING BARTENDERS, FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN BREWERYS HIGH-ENERGY FLOAT MADE A SPLASH AT SOLVANGS DANISH DAYS PARADE SATURDAY. WERE VERY COMPETITIVE. WE LIKE TO ENTERTAIN AND OF COURSE WERE GOING TO BRING OUR BEST EVERY TIME WE COME, OUR BEER AS WELL AS OUR SHOW, FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN BREWING CO. CO-OWNER JIM DIETENHOFER SAID. THE BREW MASTERS CAME OUT WITH A BUS WRAPPED IN WOOD PANELING AND FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN BEER LABELS ALONG WITH A TRUCK PULLING A TRAILER STAGED WITH THE FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN BAND, FOLLOWED BY A VIKING SHIP. IMMIGRANT SONG IS ACTUALLY ABOUT VIKINGS, JAMIE DIETENHOFER, CO-OWNER OF FIGUEROA MOUNTAIN BREWING CO. SAID. WE JUST LOVE ROCKING AND HAVING FUN. LAST YEAR, THE BREWING COMPANY STAGED IMPROMPTU BATTLES BETWEEN BARTENDERS DRESSED AS VIKINGS ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE, HE ADDED. WE LIKE TO MIX IT UP, DIETENHOFER SAID.
640	"OUR LUNGS HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED AND WE CANNOT TAKE FURTHER POLLUTION THROUGH BURSTING OF CRACKERS," SAID THREE INFANTS IN THEIR PETITION BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT SEEKING A BAN ON CRACKERS THIS DUSSEHRA AND DIWALI BESIDES A HOST OF MEASURES LIKE IMPLEMENTATION OF BHARAT V NORMS FOR VEHICLES TO ARREST THE CAPITAL'S WORSENING AIR QUALITY. THEY'RE ONLY MONTHS OLD - INDIAN LAW ALLOWS THEM TO FILE PETITION! IN A FIRST OF ITS KIND PETITION IN JUDICIAL HISTORY, THE INFANTS - TWO SIX-MONTH-OLDS ARJUN GOPAL AND AARAV BHANDARI AND 14-MONTH-OLD ZOYA RAO BHASIN - MOVED THE SC THROUGH THEIR ADVOCATE FATHERS TO SEEK SEVERAL MEASURES TO MITIGATE POLLUTION AND EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO CLEAN AIR GUARANTEED UNDER ARTICLE 21 OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE SUPREME COURT RULES PERMIT MINORS TO FILE PETITIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THROUGH THEIR PARENTSJ AND GUARDIANS WHO TERM THEMSELVES AS 'NEXT FRIENDS'. THE IMMEDIATE PROVOCATION FOR THE FILING OF THE WRIT PETITION UNDER ARTICLE 32 OF THE CONSTITUTION WAS THE CRACKERS THAT WOULD GO UP IN A BURST OF SOUND, FLAME ASND SMOKE DURING THE COMING FESTIVE SEASON.  THEY ALSO WANTED MEASURES TO CHECK POLLUTION HAZARDS LIKE BURNING CROP RESIDUES, POLLUTING VEHICLES AND OPEN WASTE DISPOSAL. THEY SAID, "OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, DELHI HAS RETAINED THE UNIQUE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE MOST POLLUTED CITY IN THE WORLD. THE LEVELS OF PARTICULATE MATTER ARE HIGHEST, AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, OVER 7 LAKH DEATHS OCCUR ANNUALLY DUE TO AIR-POLLUTION RELATED DISEASES. HOW POLLUTION IS CHOKING INDIA "STUDIES SHOW THAT INDIAN CITIZENS HAVE 30% LOWER LUNG CAPACITY THAN EUROPEANS, AND THAT CHILDREN ARE THE WORST AFFECTED, AS THEIR LUNGS HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED AND THEIR SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE. IN DELHI, A MAJORITY OF THE POLLUTION IS CAUSED BY OVER 500 MILLION TONNES OF CROP RESIDUE BURNT ANNUALLY IN NEIGHBOURING AREAS, BY POLLUTING TRUCKS THAT PASS THROUGH THE CITY DURING THE NIGHT, ROAD DUST AND POLLUTION FROM INDUSTRIES. "TO ADD TO THIS, THE SMOKE FROM BURSTING OF CRACKERS IN THE MONTHS OF OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER DURING THE FESTIVALS OF DUSSEHRA AND DIWALI VIRTUALLY CLOGS THE ATMOSPHERE, SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES THE POLLUTION LEVEL AND MAGNIFIES THE RISK OF CONTRACTING LUNG DISEASES." THEY SAID EVERY YEAR, THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF POLLUTION GETS DEBATED AND FORGOTTEN AS THE LETHARGIC GOVERNMENT MACHINERY DOES LITTLE TO PROTECT CITIZENS, ESPECIALLY INFANTS AND CHILDREN, FROM THE LONG-TERM TOXIC EFFECTS OF DEADLY POLLUTION ENVELOPING THE CAPITAL CITY. THE INFANTS ALSO SOUGHT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS FROM THE COURT TO THE GOVERNMENT ON A BAN ON BURNING POST-HARVEST CROP RESIDUE, STRINGENT ACTION AGAINST THOSE WHO DUMP DUST, MALBA (CONCRETE WASTE) AND OTHER POLLUTANTS AND INTRODUCING BHARAT-V EMISSION NORMS FOR VEHICLES.

WHEN HE ARRIVES, EVENT STAFF CLEAR OUT A 25-FOOT RADIUS FOR HIS PERFORMING AREA, WHICH IS NEVER ON STAGE, BUT IS SOMETIMES IN FRONT OF ONE. TORCH PREFERS TO BE ON THE GROUND, WITH HIS AUDIENCE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE THE NUANCES OF HIS DANGEROUS PERFORMANCE. THE RADIUS IS TO KEEP THE AUDIENCE SAFE FROM THE BIG AND FLASHY MOVES, SUCH AS THE 8- AND 10-FOOT FLAMES SHOT FROM HIS MOTORCYCLE, THE 30- AND 40-FOOT CURLS STEMMING FROM HIS FLAMETHROWER AND TO KEEP THEM A REASONABLE DISTANCE FROM THE TALL FLAMES HE BREATHES. TORCH ALSO USES AN  ARRAY OF NUNCHUCKS, A BULLWHIP AND A FIRE STAFF (THAT LOOKS LIKE A BATON) TO SPIN, CRACK AND WIELD FIRE IN CIRCLES, ARCS AND OTHER SHAPES. "WHEN YOU SAY 'FIRE SHOW,' YOU PICTURE SOMEONE DOING A VERY SLOW PACE," TORCH SAYS. "MOST [FIRE PERFORMERS] ARE WEIRD LOOKING DUDES TRYING TO LOOK SEXY [WHILE PERFORMING]. THEY HAVE THEIR SHIRT OFF AND HAVE LONG HAIR OR HAVE GIRLS IN HULA HOOPS. "A LOT OF THE FIRE PERFORMERS DO ONE THING AT A SLOW PACE AND CAN DRAG IT OUT FOR 5 OR 10 MINUTES." BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU GET WITH HIS SHOW, BECAUSE HE'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE FIRE PERFORMER. "MINE HAS LOTS OF ENERGY, WORKING THE CROWD AND GETTING LOTS OF ENERGY GOING," HE SAYS. "IT'S MORE IN-YOUR-FACE ... TO GET THE WHOLE CROWD'S ATTENTION." RATHER THAN A BIG, LONG SET, TORCH WILL DO VARIOUS ACTS, USUALLY AT 30 SECONDS TO A MINUTE EACH. ONCE SOMETHING STOPS BEING INTERESTING, HE STOPS DOING IT. HE FEEDS ON THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CROWD AND EXERTS SO MUCH ENERGY WITH EACH PERFORMANCE THAT HE USUALLY FEELS SICK AFTERWARD, FROM ALL THE EFFORT SPENT AND THE HIGH DEMAND IT PUTS ON HIS BODY. WHILE DOING A SHOW, "TO PUMP UP ENERGY, I'LL BE RUNNING AROUND LIKE A MANIAC," HE SAYS. BUT THE TECHNIQUE OF EATING FIRE TAKES DISCIPLINE, INCLUDING HIGH CONTROL OF HIS BREATHING. GOING FULL THROTTLE TO AN INSTANT STOP MEANS A LOT OF PRACTICE. TORCH GOT HIS START IN 2009 WHEN HE LEARNED HOW TO USE BASIC FIRE PERFORMING EQUIPMENT FROM A FIRE-EATING GO-GO DANCER AT A DALLAS NIGHTCLUB, WHERE HE WORKED. AFTER A FEW 10- AND 15-MINUTE TEACHING SESSIONS, HE BOUGHT HIS OWN EQUIPMENT AND PERFORMED A COUPLE TIMES A NIGHT SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK. HE STARTED TOURING IN 2012 AND ENJOYS STAYING ON THE ROAD. IT KEEPS HIM CLOSE TO NATURE, GIVES HIM A WAY TO SEE THE COUNTRY AND INTRODUCES HIM TO WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A STELLAR GROUP OF PEOPLE. "ABOVE ALL, I'M A BIKER," HE SAYS ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE. "I LOVE MY BIKER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND WHAT WE REPRESENT, WHICH IS GREAT CAUSES." IT INFLUENCES THE VENUES HE PICKS FOR PERFORMANCE, WHICH INCLUDE PLENTY OF BIKER RALLIES. "YOU BECOME FAMILY WITH A LOT OF [PEOPLE] AT THESE RALLIES," HE SAYS.  TIMB TECHNICAL MANAGER BLESSING DHOKOTERA, ON BEHALF OF THE TEAM THANKED THE TLTC MANAGEMENT FOR THE WORKSHOP, SAYING WHAT TLTC WAS DOING WAS AN EYE OPENER FOR THEM. "BIKERS ARE A CLOSE KNIT GROUP OF PEOPLE. A LOT GOES INTO THESE RALLIES [INCLUDING] A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE." NAN WHAT'S UP ON 09/25/2

644	REVISION LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY & THECURE IS CURIOSITY.  IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING MY JOURNEY, CHECK OUT THE PREVIOUS PIECES OF THE STORY HERE: WK1 , WK2 , WK3 , WK4 WEVE ALL HEARD THE SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, DOES IT MAKE A SOUND? THIS QUESTION DRAWSON MANY NOTIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE SELF, AND THAT IF ONE DOES NOT EXPERIENCE SOMETHING, THAN THE QUESTION IS DID ITREALLY HAPPEN? BUT LETS GO BACK AND THINK INSTEAD OF THIS SCENARIO: IF LIGHTING STRIKES IN THE WOODS AND STARTS A FIRE, BUT NO ONE IS AROUND TO SEE IT, WILL IT STILL BURN A PART OF THE FOREST DOWN? THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS YES. OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY DOES NOT DICTATE WHAT IS REAL, BUT MERELY WHAT WE ARE PERCEIVING AS AN ACTIVE PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE EXIST. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES, HOW DO WE INCLUDE THIS LIGHTNING STRIKE IN OUR LIVES SO THAT WE CAN BE AN ACTIVE FORCE IN STOPPING THE FOREST FIRE? THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. SINCE WE CANT CHANGE WHERE THE LIGHTNING STRIKES, WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE OUT LOOKING FOR IT. IN SHORT, IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD, WE HAVE TO BE AN ACTIVE PIECE IN IT. OUR BODIES ARE TEMPLES FOR OUR MINDS FLESHY PRISONS WITH WHICH WE TRAVERSE THIS LIFE IN ORDER TO SEEK BALANCE AND PEACE AND FREEDOM. HOWEVER, IN THIS BELIEF, OUR BODIES ARE STILL PLAYERS IN THE GAME OF LIFE; THEY ARE THETEMPLE WITHIN WHICH OUR MINDS RESIDE, SO SHOULDNT WE BE TREATING OUR TEMPLES LIKE TEMPLES?! AND BY THIS, I MEAN TO PUSH OUR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND STAMINA TO THEIR LIMITS AND TO SEEK CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT ON THIS PHYSICAL FORM IN WHICH EXIST. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUS AAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. LETS PLAY THE WHAT IF GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS: WHAT IF YOU ARE WALKING TO YOUR CAR AND THREE PEOPLE GET THE DROP ON YOU; COULD YOU DEFEND YOURSELF? WHAT IF YOUR HOME CATCHES ON FIRE AND THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THE SECOND STORY WINDOW; DO YOU KNOW HOW TO JUMP AND LAND SAFELY? WHAT IF YOUR SON WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM? WHAT IF YOU WORKED A FEW MINUTES FROM HOME AND YOUR WIFE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND NEEDED YOU HOME IMMEDIATELY,BUT YOUR CAR WAS DEAD IN THE PARKING LOT, COULD YOU RUN ALL THE WAY HOME? CAN YOU PROTECT THE ONES YOU LOVE? COULD YOU OUTRUN SOMETHING HUNTING YOU DOWN? CAN YOU SURVIVE ON YOUR OWN WHEN TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE WITHIN REACH TO HELP YOU? I SPENT THE WEEK PRACTICING HUAQUAN AND RUNNING. MY BEST FRIEND, ALSO AN ADVENTURE ENTHUSIAST, AND I SPENT THE WEEKENDCLIMBING THROUGH AERIAL OBSTACLE COURSES IN THE TREES OF THE BERKSHIRES IN MASSACHUSETTS.AFTER THE LONG WEEKEND, I BEGAN THE WEEK LIKE I ALWAYS DO, EXHAUSTED; BUT I COULD FEEL THE HAPPINESS IN EACH SORE MUSCLE FIBER. THE ELONGATED SIGH AS ONE SETTLES IN TO THE COUCH AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, OR INTO A HOT TUB ON THE FIRST DAY OF VACATION, THAT IS WHAT EACH OF MY MUSCLES FEELS. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUSAAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. SO WHAT HAS THIS SHOWN ME? WELL FIRST, LETS RECAP THE RECENT FOUR WEEKS CHALLENGES: I HAVE BEGUN TO REFINE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SINCE I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY. MY GIRLFRIEND STARTED A NEW JOB AS A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHICH REQUIRES HER TO BE WAKING UP AT 3:30AM MOST MORNINGS (LAST NIGHT WE AWOKE AT 1:45AM). I HAVE BEGUN TO WAKE UP WITH HER, AS OPPOSED TO 6AM, AND ENSURE THAT HER BREAKFAST/ LUNCH ARE READY FOR THE DAY. I DONT WORK OUT FOR TWO HOURS, BUT FOR A HALF AN HOUR: A WARM UP ROUTINE CONSISTING OF PUSH UPS, SIT UPS, LEG RAISES, AND TRICEP DIPS. I SPEND THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING IMMERSED IN THE ONLINE WORLD CHECKING EMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS, NETWORKING, WORKING ON WRITING/ EDITING, OR SOME MORNINGS JUST GAMING. AS MY LIFE EVOLVES, SO MUST I. THOSE THAT ARE AFRAID OF CHANGE GET LEFT IN THE DUST.  WHAT IS VERTIGO? FEAR OF FALLING? NO, VERTIGO IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN FEAR OF FALLING.  ONE CRITICAL VIOLATION ATKINS MIDDLE SCHOOL, 5401 AVE. IT IS THE VOICE OF THE EMPTINESS BELOW US WHICH TEMPTS AND LURES US, IT IS THE DESIRE TO FALL, AGAINST WHICH, TERRIFIED, WE DEFEND OURSELVES. I TIME LAST WEEK WORKING ON EXACTLY WHAT I SET OUT TO DO. I DREW UP A BUSINESS PLAN FOR LAUNCHING MY OWN COMPANY.OVER THE COURSE THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE RESEARCHED SIMILAR PEOPLE TO MYSELF AND THEIR VENTURES. THE VERDICT IS IN: STARTING OUT ON YOUR OWN IS DIFFICULT; IN WAYS THAT I COULD SIT HERE AND DESCRIBE TO YOU, BUT I DONT WANT YOU TO BE AFRAID OF EVER DOING IT.IT REQUIRES PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE AND A LOT OF HARD WORK. AS ANAIS NIN WROTE, LIFE SHRINKS OR EXPANDS IN PROPORTION TO ONES COURAGE. IF YOU DESIRE STRONGLY ENOUGH AND POSSESS THE PROPER COURAGE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. I PRESENTED MYBUSINESS PLAN TO MY BEST FRIEND OVER COFFEE. WE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF MY PLAN. IT WILL REQUIRE HUGE EFFORT AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR FREE TIME. HOWEVER, AFTER MUCH DELIBERATING, WE HAVE DECIDED TO PURSUE THIS AVENUE AS A MEANS TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE.IT WILL STILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE BUILD UP A PLATFORM FROM WHICH WE CAN LAUNCH. FOR NOW, THIS MEANSTHAT THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS OF MY JOURNEY HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS IM WELL ON THE WAY TO LOVING MY LIFE AND FINDING MORE AND MORE WAYS TO BATTLE MY DEPRESSION WHEN IT REARS ITS UGLY HEAD! HOWEVER, IM NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS METAPHOR, THATS A GOOD THING. THE ONLY WAY IN LIFE WE COULD EVER HEAR THAT TREE FALL, OR STOP THAT FOREST FIRE, IS TO BE PRESENT; AND THAT MEANS PUTTING YOURSELF INTO SITUATIONS THAT YOU WOULDNT NORMALLY BE IN. THOUGH WHAT IS NORMAL? THE TREND OF A THING TO REMAIN AT A CONSTANT ACCEPTED BY A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN PLACE. BECAUSE NORMAL FOR YOU MAY NOT BE NORMAL FOR ME. BECAUSE NORMAL ALL OVER THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT.  LIVE. JOURNEY. ADVENTURE.  THE PRIME MINISTER NOTED WITH APPRECIATION THE GOVERNMENT'S AMBITION TO REVIVE THE FARMING COOPERATIVES AS IT WAS A MAJOR STEP TOWARDS RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND JOB CREATION. ALL OF LIFE IS ADVENTURE. BUT DYLLON, I DONT HAVE THE TIME TO BE ADVENTURING, OR STARTING NEW THINGS IM AN INDOORS GUY, GOING OUT AND ADVENTURING JUST ISNT FOR ME I LIVE IN A CITY, WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND A TREE IN A CITY IN 2015? THESE ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS. BUT OTHER THAN THE LAST GUY WHO IS STILL CAUGHT UP ON THE TREE METAPHOR, KEEP IN MIND WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY, ADVENTURE. TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER ANY TIME PERIOD IN YOUR LIFE. OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE REMEMBERING THE TIME PERIOD BASED ON THE EVENTS. YOU DONT REMEMBER EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR DAYS BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE WASNT EXCITING; EVERY MINUTE DIDNT LEAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION ON YOU. WHAT STANDS OUT IN LIFE WHAT REALLY GIVES YOU ENERGY AND MAKES YOU GO IS THE UNUSUAL, THE CHANGE, & THE AWESOME. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. WALKING TO THE BATHROOM ON YOUR HANDS. BUILDING A FORT WITH YOUR KIDS. COOKING A FOREIGN DISH FOR AROUND THE WORLD NIGHT FOR YOUR WIFE. SEEING A TREND? REMEMBER: CHALLENGING YOURSELF WILL ONLY PRODUCE POSITIVE EFFECTS. NEW EXPERIENCES CAN ONLY CAUSE US TO GROW. THUSLY, MY CHALLENGE FOR THIS UPCOMING WEEK WILL BE TO ADVENTURE AT LEAST ONCE A DAY, AND DO SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING AT LEAST ONCEEACH WEEK.

646	IN 2014, NATIONAL COUNCIL ON ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCE OF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, INC. (NCADD OF MIDDLESEX), INC. INITIATED QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH EFFORTS TO EXAMINE CURRENT AWARENESS AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE AGENCYS BRAND IDENTITY; POTENTIAL BARRIERS WITH THE BRAND NAME; AND, WHAT THE AGENCY NEEDED TO IMPROVE ITS BRAND IDENTITY TO ONE THAT MORE CLOSELY RESONATES WITH ITS TARGET AUDIENCES AS WELL AS CURRENT AND FUTURE EFFORTS THE AGENCY IMPLEMENTS. WE LEARNED THAT: THE NCADD NAME CREATES CONFUSION AS TO WHETHER THE ORGANIZATION IS NATIONAL OR LIMITED TO MIDDLESEX COUNTY; ONE OF NCADDS PRIMARY FUNCTIONS IS PREVENTION, WHICH IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE NAME; AND, THE NCADD LOGO IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AGENCY AND WHAT IT DOES. THE RESULT OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS IS OUR NEW NAME, THE WELLNESS CENTER FOR PREVENTION, SAID BOARD OF TRUSTEES PRESIDENT JEFF JANNARONE. NOW, ADDED JANNARONE, OUR NEW TAGLINE REPRESENTS THE AGENCYS COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING HEALTHY LIVING THROUGH EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND ADVOCACY. THE WORD WELLSPRING IT IS A REAL WORD, BUT IT PLAYS OFF WELLNESS (PREVENTION) AND SOURCE (RESOURCE AND THE SOURCE OF THE BEST INFORMATION) WE PROVIDE THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, NOTED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR EZRA HELFAND. OUR NEW NAME INVOKES A BOTTOM-UP ORGANIC APPROACH. WELLSPRING REPRESENTS THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT SOME BIG, IMPERSONAL INSTITUTION. WE COME FROM A LOCAL PLACE AND DEVELOP IDEAS, SERVICES, AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE THEN SCALABLE TO WIDER AUDIENCES, BUT ARE GROUNDED IN THE WORK WE DO IN COMMUNITIES. HELFAND SAID THAT WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES. WE CHANGE PEOPLES LIVES THROUGH PREVENTION EDUCATION AND POSITIVE COMMUNITY CHANGE. SINCE 1980, NCADD/WELLSPRING HAS BEEN PROVIDING A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES THAT FEATURE: AN EVER-EXPANDING ARRAY OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT COURSES FOR ADDICTION COUNSELORS, PREVENTION SPECIALISTS, SCHOOL FACULTY, AND SCHOOL STAFF. EDUCATIONAL SERVICES (TO SCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITY) AND SUPPORT TO THOSE WHO NEED ASSISTANCE CONFRONTING THE DISEASE OF ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCE IN THE FORM OF INFORMATION, GUIDANCE, OR REFERRAL. SERVICES FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND THE WELLBEING OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. FAR FROM TELLING YOUTH TO JUST SAY NO, WE PLEDGE TO ONLY PROVIDE SERVICES THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE CHANGE BEHAVIOR FOR THE BETTER. EFFORTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE, ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUTH. WE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASED COLLABORATION AND PLANNING COORDINATION, AND SHARING OF RESOURCES, THEREBY MAXIMIZING THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS OF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, AND BEYOND. THE COALITION FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES IS WHERE WE BRING TOGETHER PROFESSIONALS FROM MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES THAT HAVE A PASSION FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND OTHER SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR NEW COMPANY NAME, CONCLUDED HELFAND. WE BELIEVE THE NAME WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION ALLOWS US TO BETTER REPRESENT WHO WE ARE AND WILL ENABLE US TO OFFER AND INTRODUCE NEW SERVICES. CHANGING OUR NAME TO WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION FINALIZES AN ONGOING SHIFT IN CORPORATE STRATEGY THAT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, ADDED JANNARONE. WHILE WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN WHAT WEVE ACCOMPLISHED TO-DATE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND INNOVATE. THE NEW NAME IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, AND WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE AGENCYS PRODUCT AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE CALENDAR YEAR 2015 AND THROUGH EARLY 2016.

649	CANBERRA (AFP) - MALCOLM TURNBULL WAS TO BE SWORN IN AS PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA ON TUESDAY JUST HOURS AFTER MASTERMINDING A COUP AGAINST CONSERVATIVE LEADER TONY ABBOTT AND PLEDGING A NEW ECONOMIC VISION. TURNBULL WILL BE THE COUNTRY'S 29TH PRIME MINISTER -- AND THE FOURTH IN FIVE YEARS AS AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL PARTIES MAINTAIN A BRUTAL TRADITION OF SWIFTLY REMOVING FAILING LEADERS. "I'M FILLED WITH OPTIMISM AND WE WILL BE SETTING OUT IN THE WEEKS AHEAD... MORE OF THOSE FOUNDATIONS THAT WILL ENSURE OUR PROSPERITY IN THE YEARS AHEAD," TURNBULL TOLD REPORTERS. AFTER THE SWEARING IN BY GOVERNOR-GENERAL PETER COSGROVE, THE FORMER COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER WAS TO ATTEND A LIBERAL PARTY MEETING AND THEN HOLD HIS FIRST CABINET SESSION AFTER PLEDGING TO RUN A COLLABORATIVE AND CONSULTATIVE GOVERNMENT, IN CONTRAST TO ABBOTT'S DIVISIVE RULE. THE TIMING FOR THE SWEARING-IN CEREMONY WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY KNOWN. HE WOULD ALSO BE IN PARLIAMENT DURING THE AFTERNOON TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS NEW PRIME MINISTER. "THIS IS A TURN OF EVENTS I DID NOT EXPECT, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, BUT IT'S ONE THAT I'M PRIVILEGED TO UNDERTAKE, AND ONE THAT I'M CERTAINLY UP TO," TURNBULL ADDED. HE WAS WIDELY EXPECTED TO APPOINT SOCIAL SERVICES MINISTER SCOTT MORRISON AS TREASURER TO SELL THE NEW ECONOMIC VISION. "THE PRIME MINISTER (ABBOTT) HAS NOT BEEN CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THE ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP OUR NATION NEEDS", TURNBULL SAID MONDAY. ABBOTT WON POWER IN A GENERAL ELECTION VICTORY IN SEPTEMBER 2013 BUT HIS FIRST BUDGET PROVED HIGHLY UNPOPULAR. HE SURVIVED A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE IN FEBRUARY AFTER POOR POLLING AND A SERIOUS OF GAFFES IGNITED A BACKBENCH REVOLT. AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER TONY ABBOTT (C) WALKS THOUGH PARLIAMENT HOUSE IN CANBERRA AFTER HE WAS DRA BUT ABBOTT HAS SINCE FAILED TO TURN AROUND THE POLLS, BOLSTER THE ECONOMY OR STOP DAMAGING INTERNAL LEAKS AND LOST THE SUPPORT OF THE MAJORITY OF HIS PARTY. AFTER HIS 54-44 VICTORY LATE MONDAY, TURNBULL, A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE FORMER LAWYER AND BANKER, RULED OUT AN EARLY NATIONAL ELECTION TO CEMENT HIS LEADERSHIP. ELECTIONS DO NOT NEED TO BE HELD BEFORE JANUARY 2017. TURNBULL ALSO SAID THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO AUSTRALIA'S CLIMATE POLICY. BUT, WITH STRONG SUPPORT FROM FOREIGN MINISTER JULIE BISHOP, WHO THE PARTY RE-ELECTED DEPUTY LEADER WITH A STRONG 70-30 VOTE IN HER FAVOUR, HE WAS EXPECTED TO SHAKE UP THE CABINET. TURNBULL IS THOUGHT LIKELY TO SWEEP OUT TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVES AND BRING IN YOUNGER BLOOD AND MORE WOMEN. BUT TURNBULL SAID HE WILL NOT ANNOUNCE A RESHUFFLE OF HIS MINISTERS BEFORE FRIDAY. SYDNEY'S DAILY TELEGRAPH HEADLINED "SMILING ASSASSIN" BENEATH A PICTURE OF A BEAMING TURNBULL, NOTING "MALCOLM KNIFES TONY". THE AUSTRALIAN FRONT-PAGED "TURNBULL'S TRIUMPH" WHILE THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD RAN WITH "THE COUP". THE FINANCIAL REVIEW SAID THE LIBERAL PARTY WAS RIPPING ITSELF APART "AMID SCENES OF CARNAGE".
650	EUROGAMER.NET FOLLOW @EUROGAMER HOME ARTICLES PC PLAYSTATION 4 XBOX ONE EXTREME EXORCISM: THE GAME WHERE YOU HUNT YOUR OWN GHOST BOO(M). BY CHRISTIAN DONLAN PUBLISHED 22/09/2015 I DIDN'T FIND MYSELF THINKING OF HYPERTHYMESIA AS I PLAYED EXTREME EXORCISM, BECAUSE THERE ISN'T REALLY MUCH TIME TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING WHEN EXTREME EXORCISM IS GOING ON. AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED, HOWEVER, THAT'S WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT HYPERTHYMESIA. AND IN KEEPING WITH THE SPOOKY CONTEXT, HYPERTHYMESIA IS BOTH A BLESSING AND A CURSE. WOULDN'T IT BE BRILLIANT TO HAVE AN AMAZING MEMORY, EH? WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF YOU NEVER FORGOT ANYTHING? ACTUALLY, WOULDN'T IT BE KIND OF AWFUL? THE WORLD WOULD BE FILLED WITH YOUR MEMORIES, EVERY TRIP TO THE SHOP YOU HAD EVER TAKEN CROWDING IN WHEN YOU HEADED INTO TOWN, EVERY FILM YOU HAD SEEN CONVERGING AS YOU WENT TO THE CINEMA, AS YOU SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA. THE WORLD WOULD BE FILLED WITH GHOSTS. THAT'S HYPERTHYMESIA: A CONDITION THAT DESCRIBES PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO FORGET ANYTHING. EXTREME EXORCISM ALLOWS YOU TO POKE AT SUCH HORRORS FROM A SAFE DISTANCE, THOUGH. IT'S A SIDE-SCROLLING ARENA ACTION GAME, IN WHICH YOU RACE THROUGH CLUTTERED SINGLE-SCREEN LEVELS PICKING UP WEAPONS AND DOING IN ENEMIES TO EARN POINTS. THE TWIST IS THAT EVERY ENEMY AFTER THE FIRST IS A GHOST - A GHOST OF YOUR PREVIOUS MOVEMENTS. EXTREME EXORCISM IS A GAME ABOUT HUNTING YOUR PAST SELVES DOWN BEFORE THEY CAN GIVE YOUR PRESENT SELF A SHOEING. AND IT'S AS DELIGHTFUL AND PANICKY AS I'VE MADE THAT SOUND. IT MESSES WITH THE HEAD, TOO. EACH TIME YOU PLAY IT, YOU'RE WORRYING ABOUT YOUR PREVIOUS SELVES - THE GHOSTS OF WHOM ARE GUNNING FOR YOU WITHOUT KNOWING IT - BUT YOU'RE ALSO WORRYING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE SELF: HOW CAN I GET EVERYTHING DONE NOW, WITHOUT MAKING TROUBLE FOR MYSELF IN A FEW MOMENT'S TIME? YOU'RE BASICALLY PLOTTING MURDERS, BUT ALLOWING WIGGLE-ROOM SO THAT YOU CAN DROP IN IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND PLOT YOUR OWN MURDER. IT MESSES WITH THE HEAD. THE BEST VITA GAMES OUR PICK OF THE GAMES ON SONY'S INDIE POWERHOUSE HANDHELD. ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING AT A BRISK, DOUBLE-JUMP PACE, TOO. I REALLY ADMIRE THE DETAILING HERE: I LOVE THE WAY THAT YOU CAN HOLD UP TO THREE WEAPONS AT ANY POINT, AND THAT, IF YOU DO, YOU'LL FIND THAT YOU ALSO FIRE ALL THREE AT ONCE. I LOVE THE WAY THAT EACH TIME YOU'RE DROPPED INTO A MAP, YOU ONLY HAVE TO KILL THE MOST RECENT GHOST OF YOURSELF - YOU'LL SPOT THEM, BECAUSE THEY'RE WEARING A CROWN - A DECISION THAT, IN TURN, ENCOURAGES YOU TO TRACE CLOSER AND CLOSER TO YOUR PREVIOUS MOVEMENTS EACH TIME: A STRANGELY RECURSIVE PROCESS. MOST OF ALL, WHILE EXTREME EXORCISM IS GREAT IN MULTIPLAYER, I LOVE THE WAY THAT THE CENTRAL GIMMICK - USING PAST LIVES TO CREATE PRESENT ENEMIES - ALLOWS FOR A SINGLE-PLAYER GAME THAT FEELS WILD AND HUMAN AND FILLED WITH SURPRISES. IT REMINDS ME OF GYROMANCER, A BRILLIANT MATCH-THREE RPG HYBRID, THAT DITCHED ENEMY AI IN FAVOUR OF A MORE ELEGANT SYSTEM, IN WHICH YOUR OWN WASTED MOVES DID YOU DAMAGE. THERE'S A DEFINITE SPACE IN THE WORLD FOR GAMES THAT WEAPONISE PAST PLAYER ACTIONS, AND PAST MISTAKES, IN INTERESTING WAYS. WE NEED MORE GAMES THAT REALLY KNOW HOW TO USE MEMORIES - AND GHOSTS.

653	BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS ARE POLYMER MATERIALS WHICH ARE QUICKLY DEGRADABLE THROUGH MICROBIAL LIFE ACTIVITIES IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS OR UNDER CONDITIONS OF COMPOSTING. CURRENTLY, MORE THAN 70% OF GLOBAL BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS ARE USED IN THE PACKAGING INDUSTRY.IN RECENT YEARS, WITH THE CONTINUED PROMOTION OF THE LOW-CARBON ECONOMY, THE GLOBAL BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS OUTPUT HAS MAINTAINED A HIGH GROWTH RATE, ATTAINING ABOUT 668 KILOTONS IN 2014. ALL OVER THE WORLD, ONLY PLASTARCH MATERIAL (PSM), POLYLACTIC ACID (PLA), POLYBUTYLENE SUCCINATE (PBS), ETC. HAVE REALIZED INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION. IN 2014, PSM, PLA AND PBS ACCOUNTED FOR 41%, 24% AND 21% OF THE WORLD'S TOTAL OUTPUT, RESPECTIVELY.GLOBAL DEMAND FOR BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS IS MAINLY CONCENTRATED IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA, AND THEIR DEMAND ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 70% IN 2014 TOGETHER. HOWEVER, IN RECENT YEARS, THE ASIAN MARKET HAS GENERATED FAST-GROWING DEMAND, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REPRESENT 32.3% IN 2018.GLOBAL BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS ENTERPRISES ARE MAINLY FROM EUROPE, AMERICA AND JAPAN, SUCH AS EUROPE-BASED BASF, NOVAMONT AND CORBION, AMERICA-BASED NATUREWORKS AND METABOLIX, JAPAN-BASED MITSUBISHI CHEMICAL AND SHOWA DENKO.

654	BOSTON, MA -- ( SBWIRE ) -- 09/22/2015 -- POWER HAS BECOME A BASIC NECESSITY. CONTINUOUS AND RELIABLE POWER IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COUNTRY. AS THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY GROWS, THERE IS AN INCREASE IN POPULATION, INFRASTRUCTURAL ACTIVITIES, AND INDUSTRIALIZATION, LEADING TO INCREASE IN REQUIREMENT FOR POWER. BUT DUE TO CERTAIN FACTORS LIKE POOR MAINTENANCE AND LACK OF INVESTMENT IN THE POWER SECTOR, THERE IS STILL SHORTAGE OF POWER ACROSS THE GLOBE. RENTAL POWER PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN BRIDGING THIS GAP. THE MOST COMMON RENTAL EQUIPMENT ARE DIESEL AND GAS GENERATORS. THESE ARE USEFUL DURING PEAK HOURS OR IN REMOTE LOCATIONS WHERE POWER NETWORK IS NOT AVAILABLE. POWER RENTAL IS MORE ECONOMICAL THAN USING A RESERVE PLANT, LEADING TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR RENTAL POWER.

655	REVISE - I MOVED TO AFRICAN CONTINENTAL BANK. EVEN AS CASHIER IN ACB, I REMEMBER ONE DAY, AS I WENT FOR LUNCH, SOMEBODY FOLLOWED ME AND ASKED THAT I SHOULD CHANGE SOME COUNTERFEIT MONEY FOR HIM, SAYING HE WOULD GIVE ME A SHARE FROM IT. I WAS AFRAID AND I RAN AWAY BECAUSE I FELT SOMEBODY COULD BE LISTENING. IT WAS DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND WE WERE AFRAID AS NON-INDIGENES, SO, I ASKED FOR A TRANSFER AND I WAS MOVED TO ONITSHA. THEREAFTER, THE CIVIL WAR INTENSIFIED, THE NIGERIAN TROOPS CONQUERED ONITSHA, WE THEN MOVED TO AWKA AND FROM THERE AGAIN, TO PORT HARCOURT. AT THAT POINT, DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF ACB WERE MOVING, EVENTUALLY, WE CAME TO OWERRI. IN OWERRI, THE MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ME BUT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY JOB. HE FELT I SHOULD BE COMING AROUND HIM LIKE OTHER PEOPLE, BUT I FELT THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THAT. AS THE WAR INTENSIFIED, THEY WERE RECRUITING PEOPLE INTO THE ARMY BY FORCE. ALTHOUGH BANKING WAS VIEWED AS PART OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES DURING THE WAR, AS THE WAR INTENSIFIED, THEY STARTED RECRUITING FROM THE BANKS AS WELL. DURING ONE OF THE DAYS THAT THEY CAME FOR RECRUITMENT, THEY CONSCRIPTED SOME PEOPLE INTO THE ARMY, BUT THEY MISSED ME BECAUSE I HAD GONE TO BUY CIGARETTE. THE MANAGER WAS NOT TOO HAPPY THAT I WAS NOT PART OF THEM. I DID NOT KNOW WHY HE WANTED ME IN THE ARMY.  THE SPORTS UTILITY VEHICLE (SUV) OFFERS A SUPERIOR RIDE ALONGSIDE ADVANCED DRIVING AND PROVIDES OWNERS WITH A VEHICLE TO SUIT THEIR NEEDS, WHATEVER THEIR LIFESTYLE. HE WENT TO THE CAMP AND SECURED THE RELEASE OF THOSE SELECTED AND ASKED THAT THE EXERCISE SHOULD BE REPEATED AND THROUGH A BALLOT SYSTEM. AGAIN, I ESCAPED BEING RECRUITED INTO THE ARMY. HE WAS NOT STILL HAPPY. AGAIN, HE ASKED THE MILITARY OFFICERS TO COME TO THE OFFICE AND PICK WHOEVER THEY WANTED ALL BECAUSE OF ME. WE WERE BUSY AT THE COUNTER THAT DAY WHEN SUDDENLY, THE MANAGER SENT FOR ME AND TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES. IN HIS OFFICE, WE MET A MILITARY CAPTAIN AND HIS ASSISTANT. THE MANAGER SAID, GENTLEMEN, THE HEADQUARTERS SAID WE SHOULD HAND YOU OVER TO THE CAPTAIN. I WANTED TO RUN AWAY, BUT THE CAPTAIN SAID HE WOULD SHOOT ME IF I DARED. THEN I ASKED THEM TO GIVE US TIME TO HAND OVER OFFICIALLY. THEY AGREED, AND AS SOON AS WE STEPPED OUT OF THE MANAGERS OFFICE, WE RAN AWAY. I RAN FOR MILES BUT AGAIN, I FOUND MYSELF IN A MILITARY CAMP WHERE ONE OF MY CLASSMATES WAS IN CHARGE. I TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED. THAT WAS HOW I STOPPED WORKING IN ACB. FROM THERE, I WENT TO LOOK FOR MY PARENTS WHERE THEY WERE BEING HELD AS REFUGEES. BY THEN, DR ILOH WAS IN CHARGE OF THE RED CROSS. I STAYED WITH HIM FOR A FEW MONTHS. THE WAR INTENSIFIED AND  I WAS AFRAID THEY WERE GOING TO CATCH ME ON THE STREETS TO JOIN THE ARMY BECAUSE THAT WAS THE NORM. SO, WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT I COULD NOT ESCAPE, I TOLD MY PARENTS THAT MY BROTHER AND I HAVE TO WILLINGLY GO AND REGISTER IN THE MILITARY. SO, WE DID, AND THE TRAINING WENT FOR THREE MONTHS. BUT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD, WE NEVER FIRED ONE SHOT. AFTER THE THIRD MONTH, WE GOT A PASS TO SEE OUR PARENTS AND THAT SAME DAY, WE WERE TOLD THEY WERE MOVING US TO THE FORCE HEADQUARTERS AND TO GABON FOR FURTHER TRAINING SINCE GABON HAD RECOGNISED BIAFRA. I TOLD MY BROTHER NOT TO TAKE THE ARMS AND AMMUNITION WHEN OUR COLLEAGUES WERE BEING GIVEN ARMS. I ASKED HIM TO FOLLOW ME. WE WENT THROUGH THE GATE AND THE SENTRY THERE SENSED THAT WE WANTED TO ESCAPE, BUT WE TOLD HIM THAT ONE OF THE OFFICERS LEFT HIS CLOTHES SOMEWHERE AND HE SENT US TO GET THEM. SURPRISINGLY, HE AGREED. AS SOON AS WE GOT OUT OF THE GATE, WE DISAPPEARED INTO THE BUSH.  NEITHER SERBIA NOR ARMENIA CAN QUALIFY. THE NEXT DAY, THE WAR ENDED. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARIS WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION? EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT CORRUPTION HAS KILLED US.  WARNING THE GOODS VEHICLE DRIVERS AND OWNERS AGAINST DRUNKEN DRIVING AND OVERSPEEDING, MADAIAH ASKED THEM TO STRICTLY FOLLOW TRAFFIC RULES AND REGULATIONS AND CO-OPERATE WITH THE POLICE IN ENSURING ROAD SAFETY. IT IS NOT ONLY ENDEMIC, IN FACT, IT HAS GOT TO THE EXTENT THAT IF YOU ARE NOT CORRUPT, YOU WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED A GOOD NIGERIAN. THAT IS THE LEVEL WE HAVE DEGENERATED. AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE CALLING BUHARI MR GO-SLOW. HOW DO YOU WANT HIM TO CLEAR THE MESS OF 16 YEARS IN 100 DAYS? I DONT KNOW WHY WE ARE NEVER TRUTHFUL WITH OURSELVES. IF THE ONLY THING BUHARI CAN ACHIEVE IS JUST TO INSTILL FEAR OF CORRUPTION, AND ALL THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND AGENCIES ARE WORKING TO DISSUADE CORRUPTION, THEN WE WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED A LOT. YOUR VIEW ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE? THE CHURCH SHOULD NOT BE SHOCKED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THE END-TIME EVENT. DONT ALSO BE SURPRISED IF OTHER STRANGE THINGS FOLLOW. I WONT BE SURPRISED IF BESTIALITY IS INTRODUCED. I WILL ONLY BE SHOCKED IF THE CHURCH GETS INVOLVED IN IT. IF NATIONS ENDORSE IT, NATIONS DONT GO BY THE BIBLE. THEY PLAY POLITICS. PARENTS MUST TALK TO THEIR CHILDREN AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT RIGHT.  YES, GOD GAVE ME VERY WONDERFUL PROMISES CONCERNING THE CHURCH; BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DID NOT BELIEVE IT. SO BY THE TIME IT HAPPENED, I WAS SHOCKED. EVERYTHING AROUND ME DID NOT SHOW THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE BIG LIKE THIS. BUT HE HAS DONE IT AND I AM EXCITED. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE GREATEST LESSONS YOU HAVE LEARNT ABOUT LIFE? YOU MUST BE READY FOR SHOCKERS. DONT THINK THAT EVERYBODY IS THE SAME. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SHOCKS, CHALLENGES AND PRESSURES. DIFFICULTIES ARE PART OF LIFE. LIFE IS MADE UP OF POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES. IT IS NEVER ONE-SIDED, IT IS MADE UP OF MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS. YOU HAVE TO SETTLE THIS IN YOUR MIND. DONT BE DISTURBED BECAUSE THEY ARE STEPPING STONES. IF I HAD ALLOWED THE CHALLENGES TO STOP ME, I WOULDNT HAVE BEEN WHERE I AM TODAY. RECENTLY, I WAS SHARING THE SAME THING WITH MY DAUGHTER. I TOLD HER THAT CHALLENGES CANNOT BUT COME AND ONE MUST LEARN TO STAND ONES GROUND, AND LEARN TO HOLD ONES HEAD HIGH. GIVING IS MORE THAN GIVING MONEY; IT IS GOOD ONE NOURISHES RELATIONSHIPS. GIVE AND MEN WOULD ADD TO IT; YOU CAN NEVER SUCCEED ALONE. SOME PEOPLE CLAIM, IM A SELF-MADE MAN, THIS IS A LIE, NO MAN IS SELF-MADE FOR YOU DID NOT GIVE BIRTH TO YOURSELF AND WHEN YOU DIE, YOU CANNOT BURY YOURSELF. DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS? I DONT THINK ALONG THIS LINE. WHAT I HAVE STUMBLED ON IN LIFE HAS STRENGTHENED AND HELPED ME. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN SAVED EARLIER THAN THE TIME IT HAPPENED.. WHAT DOES YOUR MOTHER MEAN TO YOU? I AM MORE OF MY MOTHER THAN MY FATHER. SHE WAS AN INDUSTRIOUS AND A HARDWORKING WOMAN. SHE WAS A TRADER, IN ABADA AND GEORGE. I SOLD BREAD FOR HER IN LAGOS. MY MOTHER WAS A DISCIPLINARIAN, VERY TOUGH, BUT WE LOVED HER. SHE TOOK GREAT CARE OF US AND KEPT ENCOURAGING US TO MOVE ON IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CHALLENGES OF LIFE. HOW DOES IT FEEL BEING 70 TODAY? I FEEL GREAT, HAPPY AND EXCITED THAT BY THE GRACE OF GOD, ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ATTAIN THE AGE OF 70. FOR ME, IT IS A BLESSING. I AM REALLY GRATEFUL TO GOD. A LOT OF PEOPLE ATTRIBUTE GOOD LOOKS AS HEALTH, BUT I WOULD ATTRIBUTE IT TO GOD. WHAT ROLE DID YOUR WIFE, BISHOP PEACE, PLAY IN ALL THESE? SHE IS PLAYING A WONDERFUL ROLE.  I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT EVEN WHEN IT IS NOT TRUE, BUT I AM BEING HONEST. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TOLD OURSELVES AT THE OUTSET IS THAT I AM NOT JUST HUSBAND TO PEACE, BUT HUSBAND TO EVERY WOMAN IN OUR CHURCH AND ALSO FATHER TO EVERYONE. IF YOU HAVE A WIFE THAT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED INTO, AND WHO IS POSSESSIVE, SHE WILL BE THE ONE TO DESTROY THE WORK. FOR ME, I DONT KNOW HOW I WOULD HAVE SURVIVED IF WE WERE FIGHTING EVERYDAY, THEN THE HUGE RESPONSIBILITY THAT I HAVE IN THE CHURCH WOULDNT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED. I HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING WIFE. IN ADDITION, SHE HAS HELPED TO COVER SOME OF MY OWN WEAKNESSES. WHAT WAS THE REACTION OF YOUR PARENTS TO YOUR CALLING? THEY WERE ANGRY WITH ME. THEY COULDNT UNDERSTAND IT, I WAS WORKING IN THE BANK, THE THEN AFRICAN CONTINENTAL BANK ON MARTINS STREET, LAGOS. THEY SAID OF ALL PLACES IT WAS PENTECOSTAL CHURCH (WHICH TO THEM WAS ALADURA) OF ALL CHURCHES. THEY FUMED OVER MY DECISION. THEY SAID: IF YOU WANT TO ANSWER THE CALL OF GOD, GO TO ANGLICAN OR CATHOLIC CHURCH,  OR ANY OTHER ORTHODOX CHURCH. AT A STAGE, THEY WENT TO ARRANGE FOR MY ARREST, BUT I WAS RESOLUTE. THE MINISTRY STARTED GROWING; EVEN AT AKOKA WHERE WE STARTED. LATER, THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE THE GREATNESS OF WHAT GOD WANTED ME TO DO. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU ENCOUNTERED ? THERE ARE SEVERAL CHALLENGES IN THE MINISTRY, IN EACH STEP THAT ONE TAKES. ONE CHALLENGE LEADS TO ANOTHER. I RECALL THAT IN DECEMBER 1984, WE WENT TO A CRUSADE IN ABEOKUTA, OGUN STATE. WE CAME BACK BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND ON CHRISTMAS EVE, OUR DAUGHTER DEVELOPED HIGH FEVER AND IN THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 26 SHE DIED. IT WAS A DAY I WAS GOING TO PREACH. AFTER PRAYING AND SHE DID NOT COME TO LIFE, I LEFT HER IN THE ROOM AND WENT TO PREACH. I DID NOT MENTION WHAT HAPPENED TO ANYONE. AS A MINISTER, THIS IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES YOU FACE. OUR PARENTS HAD SIX MALES AND FOUR FEMALES. THE ONLY SUPPORT I GOT FROM MY FAMILY IN MY CALLING WAS CUT SHORT. ONE OF MY BROTHERS HAD PASSED THE HIGH LEVEL EXAMINATION AND WAS TO GO FOR MEDICINE. BUT MY PARENTS REFUSED TO LET HIM GO AS A WAY OF PUNISHING HIM FOR SUPPORTING MY CAUSE AS A MINISTER. THEY ALSO WANTED TO SEE IF THAT COULD MAKE ME CHANGE MY MIND. IT DIDNT. AND EVENTUALLY, HE STILL WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY, PASSED AS A MEDICAL DOCTOR, JOINED THE NAVY AND STILL SUPPORTED ME IN THE MINISTRY. HE WAS ONE OF OUR PRAISE AND WORSHIP LEADERS. IN THE LATE 80S, I ASKED HIM TO CONDUCT AN INTERVIEW ON MY BEHALF WHEN I WAS TRAVELLING OUT. IT WAS WHEN ARMED ROBBERY WAS BECOMING AN ISSUE; SOME ROBBERS FOLLOWED HIM TO HIS CAR, CLOSED-IN ON HIM INSIDE THE CHURCH COMPOUND AND ASKED HIM TO BRING THE KEY OF HIS PEUGEOT 504 CAR. I THINK THE MILITARY INSTINCT IN HIM MADE HIM TO RESIST THEM AND HE STARTED FIGHTING THEM AND HE WAS SHOT. THEY TOOK HIM TO ONE HOSPITAL IN AKOKA, LAGOS WHERE HE COULD NOT BE MANAGED, YET HE WAS NOT REFERRED. I GOT WIND OF THE SITUATION WHILE ABROAD AND I ASKED THAT THEY MOVE HIM TO A BETTER HOSPITAL, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS LATE, HE DIED. BUT I MADE UP MY MIND THAT CHALLENGES WOULD NOT MAKE ME REJECT THE CALL OF GOD. I TOLD MYSELF THAT THE BEST I COULD DO IS TO BE THE BEST IN WHAT GOD HAS CALLED ME INTO. THERE WERE ALSO CHALLENGES OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH FUNDS. ALL THAT I HAVE DONE HAD BEEN BY FAITH. UP TILL NOW, WE DEPEND ON GOD FOR EVERY PROJECT. WHEN THE CHURCH STARTED GROWING, WE HAD NO PLACE TO GO AND WE STARTED HAVING OUR PROGRAMMES AT THE STADIUM. WE WERE EVENTUALLY DIRECTED HERE. IT WAS NOT THE KIND OF PLACE THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO BUILD ON.  GIVEN THAT THEY PAY MORE OUT OF POCKET, PATIENTS HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHERE THEY GO, PROMPTING THEM TO COMPARISON SHOP FOR HEALTHCARE JUST LIKE THEY DO FOROTHER MAJOR PURCHASES IN THEIR LIVES. IT WAS WATER-LOGGED. THE BIG QUESTION THEN WAS, HOW WOULD IT HAPPEN? BUT AGAIN, THE LORD BUILT HIS HOUSE. WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR EXPERIENCES, ESPECIALLY, BEFORE YOUR CALL? MY FATHER HAD BEEN IN LAGOS FOR A WHILE BEFORE WE MOVED IN. WHEN WE MOVED TO LAGOS, WE WERE LIVING IN A PLACE CALLED BRICKFIELD IN APAPA. I WAS SCHOOLING AT IJERO BAPTIST SCHOOL, EBUTE META AND AS THE YEARS WENT BY, MY FATHER, A DISCIPLINARIAN, FELT THAT I NEEDED TO LEAVE HOME AND LIVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE. WE WERE A BIT COMFORTABLE; HE WAS A SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT IN THE POST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS (P&T). HE MOVED ME FIRST TO OFFA IN 1957 TO LIVE WITH AN UNCLE IN OFFA GRAMMAR SCHOOL, OFFA, KWARA STATE. LATER ON, I MOVED TO MAYFLOWER GRAMMAR SCHOOL, IKENNE, OGUN STATE UNDER TAI SOLARIN FOR TWO YEARS. THERE WAS PEER PRESSURE AND THE FACT THAT I DID NOT SPEAK IGBO VERY WELL MADE MY FRIENDS TAUNT ME. SO, I TOLD MY PARENTS THAT I WANTED TO CHANGE SCHOOL. I CHANGED TO MERCHANT OF LIFE SCHOOL IN THE EAST NOW ANAMBRA STATE WHERE I GRADUATED IN 1963. I WAS A MEMBER OF THE CHOIR OF ST JUDES CHURCH, EBUTE META WITH MY SISTER.. WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL, I WORKED IN THE PORTS AUTHORITY IN LAGOS FOR A FEW MONTHS. WHAT I SAW THERE WAS FRIGHTENING HOW MONEY CHANGED HANDS. I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT AND I TOLD MY PARENTS THAT THE PLACE WAS NOT FOR ME. SO, AGAIN, I HAD TO LEAVE.
656	THE HEAD OF BOBIRWA DISTRICT HEALTH MANAGEMENT TEAM (DHMT) HAS TOLD COUNCILLORS THAT HIS TEAM WAS KEEN TO ELIMINATE MALARIA FROM THE SUB-DISTRICT. GIVING A PRESENTATION ON THE MALARIA SITUATION IN BOBIRWA RECENTLY, DR JACKSON KAGUAMBA SAID THE HOTSPOTS VILLAGES WERE SEMOLALE, MATHATHANE, LENTSWELEMORITI, MOLALATAU AND MOLETEMANE. DR KAGUAMBA SAID THE INDOOR RESIDUAL SPRAYING (IRS) EXERCISE TO WIPE MALARIA A DISEASE CAUSED BY ANOPHELES MOSQUITO, WOULD START IN OCTOBER. HE ASSURED THE COUNCILLORS THAT HE WOULD PERSONALLY LEAD THE CAMPAIGN TO ENSURE THAT ALL HOUSES IN AREAS WHERE IRS WOULD BE CONDUCTED WERE COVERED. DURING SEPTEMBER, HE NOTED THAT DMHT WOULD BE ENGAGED IN THE RECRUITMENT AS WELL AS THE TRAINING EXERCISE. DR KAGUAMBA STATED THAT UNLIKE IN AREAS LIKE CHOBE AND OKAVANGO, MALARIA IN BOBIRWA WAS SEASONAL ESPECIALLY DURING RAINY SEASONS, COULD CAUSE FATALITIES IF UNATTENDED. THEREFORE, HE CALLED FOR COLLABORATION WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO ALLOW THE DHMT TEAM TO SPRAY THEIR HOUSES, BECAUSE MALARIA HAD DEVASTATING EFFECTS AS IT CAUSES ILLNESS AND DEATH, HAD NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS ON THE ECONOMY, AFFECTS TOURISM AND AGRICULTURE. "TOURISTS FEAR VISITING COUNTRIES THAT ARE PRONE TO MALARIA LISTED BY WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION (WHO)", HE SAID. BOTSWANA, HE SAID HAD A CLEAR MISSION TO TOTALLY ELIMINATE MALARIA OUT OF THE COUNTRY, BUT WAS CONCERNED THAT THE BLANKET IRS CAMPAIGN IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS IN THE DISTRICT DID NOT PRODUCE THE INTENDED RESULTS, YIELDING ONLY 62 PER CENT, WHICH WAS BELOW THE WHO TARGET OF 85 PER CENT. DR KAGUAMBA SAID EVERY YEAR THE COUNTRY USES OVER P20 MILLION FOR IRS, AND AS SUCH THERE WAS A NEED FOR THOROUGH SUPERVISION TO ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT FUNDS WERE NOT WASTED. HE DESCRIBED IRS AS AN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE METHOD OF CONTROLLING MALARIA, BUT STATED THAT PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE FAITH IN IT, BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY STILL GET BEING BITTEN BY MOSQUITO AFTER SPRAYING. APART FROM SPRAYING, HE SAID THEY ISSUE TREATED NETS ESPECIALLY TO PREGNANT MOTHERS, CHILDREN UNDER FIVE YEARS, ELDERLY AND DISABLED PEOPLE. THE DHMT HEAD SAID SUCH MOSQUITOES THAT BITE AFTER CONDUCTING IRS WERE HARMLESS AND NONSENSICAL AND COULD NOT SPREAD THE MALARIA PARASITE. "IRS SHORTENS THE LIFESPAN OF THE MOSQUITO AND WE SHOULD SPRAY ENOUGH HOUSES TO ELIMINATE MALARIA AND FAILING TO DO SO WASTE GOVERNMENT MONEY," HE ADDED. IF THE AREAS WERE FULLY COVERED, HE SAID THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO CONDUCT THE IRS THE FOLLOWING YEAR, BUT WOULD ENGAGE IN THE MONITORING EXERCISE ONLY. HE DESCRIBED THE IRS AS THE SAFE CHEMICAL RECOMMENDED BY WHO EXPERTS AND USED ACROSS COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, AND ADVISED THAT INHABITANTS THAT MIGHT DEVELOP REACTIONS AFTER SPRAYING MUST VISIT CLINICS AND HOSPITALS. DR KAGUAMBA STATED THAT DHMT NEEDED FOUR VEHICLES TO SUPERVISE THE CAMPAIGN AND HE APPEALED TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO HELP THEM WITH RESOURCES, BECAUSE CURRENTLY THEY HAD TWO VEHICLES ON THE GROUND. COUNCILLORS APPLAUDED DHMT FOR THE EXERCISE AND KGOSI LETSO MALEMA OF MOLALATAU SUGGESTED THAT AREAS SUCH AS CATTLE POSTS, SEPTIC TANKS MUST BE SPRAYED BECAUSE THEY WERE THE BREEDING POINTS FOR MOSQUITOES. COUNCILLOR KEOAGILE RAMATLOTLO OF DANDANE-MABELENG SAID THERE WAS A NEED TO EDUCATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC ABOUT IRS, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAD MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT IT. SOURCE
657	IF YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ANY ATTENTION AT ALL OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS, YOU KNOW THAT UNITED STATES MEN'S NATIONAL TEAM HEAD COACH JURGEN KLINSMANN IS THE KING OF HEAD SCRATCHERS. THE THINGS HE SAYS ARE SO OFTEN DIFFERENT FROM THE THINGS HE DOES, OR THE THINGS WE SEE, THAT IT CAN LEAVE YOU UTTERLY BEFUDDLED AND DUMBFOUNDED. ON THURSDAY, AHEAD OF FRIDAY'S USA-PERU FRIENDLY IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL THAT TOOK THIS ONGOING DISCONNECT BETWEEN HIS UTTERANCES AND REALITY TO A NEW LEVEL. LET'S CHERRY-PICK SOME OF THE WEIRDER THINGS HE TOLD THE POST. KLINSMANN WAS TALKING ABOUT THE PRESSURE ON HIS TEAM, WHICH NOW HAS TO WIN A ONE-GAME PLAYOFF WITH MEXICO TO QUALIFY FOR THE 2017 CONFEDERATIONS CUP BECAUSE IT FAILED TO RETAIN ITS GOLD CUP TITLE IN JULY, CRASHING OUT IN THE SEMIFINALS. APPARENTLY, KLINSMANN THINKS IT'S COOL THAT HIS TEAM HAS BEEN RELEGATED TO A PLAYOFF. AS OFTEN, KLINSMANN WAS SUGGESTING THAT HE WELCOMES THE INCREASED SCRUTINY ON HIS NATIONAL TEAM. BUT THEN HE IMPLIED THAT ONLY CERTAIN PEOPLE WERE QUALIFIED TO SCRUTINIZE IT. HE DOES THAT A LOT. HE'LL DEMAND CRITICISM, BUT WHEN IT ACTUALLY COMES, HE'LL WRITE OFF THE CRITICS AS UNEDUCATED. ASIDE FROM MAKING LITTLE SENSE, WHAT THIS STATEMENT IS PROBABLY INTENDED TO MEAN IS THAT THE PERCEPTION OF THE 2-1 SEMIFINAL LOSS TO JAMAICA IN THE GOLD CUP CHANGED. IT DIDN'T. VIRTUALLY NOBODY THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD GAME AND THAT THE USA WAS UNDONE BY BAD CALLS AND THEN CHANGED THEIR MINDS. THE FIRST JAMAICAN GOAL WAS A TAD UNLUCKY BUT PERFECTLY LEGAL. THE SECOND CAME ON A RARE BUT LEGITIMATE CALL ON GOALKEEPER BRAD GUZAN. THERE WERE NO BAD CALLS. AND IT WASN'T A GOOD GAME BY THE AMERICANS. AGAIN, KLINSMANN WELCOMES FEEDBACK BUT THEN TURNS AROUND AND SAYS FEW PEOPLE ARE QUALIFIED TO GIVE IT. THEN, AS HE HAS IN THE PAST, HE SAYS THE SOCCER-WATCHING PUBLIC LACKS THE KNOWLEDGE TO JUDGE HIS TEAM. YET ANOTHER DIG AT MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER. FIRST KLINSMANN SAID HE HAS NO PREFERENCE OF WHERE HIS PLAYERS ARE EMPLOYED WHETHER STATESIDE OR IN EUROPE AND THAT HE JUDGES THEM INDIVIDUALLY AND ON THE MERITS OF THEIR OWN ABILITY. BUT THEN HE SAYS THOSE IN EUROPE FACE MUCH TOUGHER COMPETITION FOR PLAYING TIME. NOT AT ALL UNTRUE, OF COURSE, BUT THE WAY HE PUTS IT IS THAT NATIONAL TEAMERS AND DESIGNATED PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE START AUTOMATICALLY. THAT TOO MAY WELL BE TRUE, BUT CONSIDERING HIS ONGOING WAR OF WORDS WITH MLS COMMISSIONER DON GARBER AND KLINSMANN'S INSISTENCE THAT HE DOESN'T MEAN TO TROLL THE LEAGUE, IT'S A FAIRLY INCENDIARY AND IMPRUDENT THING TO SAY.

658	NINETEEN COMMONWEALTH BANK CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCEPTED COMPENSATION FROM A BANK SCHEME FOR VICTIMS OF BAD FINANCIAL ADVICE SINCE ITS LAUNCH LAST YEAR, NEW FIGURES SHOW. AN UPDATE ON THURSDAY SAID CBA'S OPEN ADVICE REVIEW, WHICH WAS CLOSED TO NEW APPLICANTS IN JULY, HAD PROMPTED 8835 CUSTOMERS TO REGISTER FOR A FREE FILE REVIEW INTO WHETHER THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION. HOWEVER, IN A SIGN OF THE PAINSTAKING REVIEW PROCESS, A MINORITY OF FILES HAVE BEEN ASSESSED SO FAR, AND THE NUMBER OF SETTLED CASES IS EVEN LOWER. THE REPORT, BY EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS PROMONTORY FINANCIAL GROUP, SAID THAT AT THE END OF AUGUST, 686 CASES HAD BEEN ASSESSED BY THE BANK. OF THIS GROUP, THE BANK HAD OFFERED COMPENSATION IN 53 CASES, OR 8 PER CENT OF ALL CASES ASSESSED. THE COMPENSATION SO FAR OFFERED BY THE BANK IS WORTH $950,252 IN TOTAL. AMONG THE 53 CUSTOMERS OFFERED A PAYOUT, 19 PEOPLE HAD ACCEPTED THE COMPENSATION, 11 HAD REJECTED THE OFFER AND 23 WERE STILL REVIEWING THE BANK'S PROPOSAL. THE BANK HAS PAID OUT $488,815 IN COMPENSATION UNDER THE SCHEME, UP FROM $79,702 AT THE END OF APRIL. CBA LAST YEAR OPENED UP THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM. IT ALLOWS ANY CUSTOMER OF COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL PLANNING AND FINANCIAL WISDOM BETWEEN 2003 AND 2012 TO HAVE THEIR FILES REVIEWED. IT FOLLOWED A DAMNING SENATE INQUIRY THAT FOUND THE BANK HAD UNDERPAID VICTIMS OF A SCANDAL, SOUGHT TO AVOID SCRUTINY, AND COVERED UP THE MISCONDUCT. "THE PROGRAM'S PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE CUSTOMERS WHO RECEIVED POOR ADVICE ARE PUT BACK IN THE POSITION THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY RECEIVED APPROPRIATE ADVICE, AND TO GIVE REASSURANCE TO OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT THE ADVICE THEY RECEIVED WAS APPROPRIATE," CBA SAID. IN APRIL, CBA CHIEF EXECUTIVE IAN NAREV SAID THE "PAINSTAKING" INVESTIGATION INTO PAST FILES WOULD TAKE UP TO MOST OF 2016. CBA SAID IT HAD INCREASED THE NUMBER OF STAFF WORKING ON THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM BY 100 SINCE MAY TO 613, ALLOWING IT TO SORT THROUGH MORE CUSTOMER FILES. WHILE IT CATALOGUED MORE THAN 900,000 CUSTOMER FILES IN THE FOUR MONTHS TO AUGUST, IT SAID THAT RETRIEVING FILES FOR FINANCIAL WISDOM CUSTOMERS WAS A "CHALLENGE" AND IT WAS STILL RELYING ON HARD COPY FILES IN SOME CASES. SEPARATELY FROM THIS COMPENSATION SCHEME, CBA HAD PAID OUT ABOUT $52 MILLION TO 1100 CUSTOMERS OF SPECIFIC ADVISERS WHO WERE IDENTIFIED FOR HAVING PROVIDED SHODDY ADVICE, MAINLY BETWEEN 2008 AND 2

660	THERE ARE MANY TRAINING METHODS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYEE EDUCATION WITHIN A GOVERNMENT AGENCY: ONLINE COURSEWARE; VIRTUAL CLASSROOOM; IN-PERSON, TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT; OR A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE. WHATEVER THE CHOICE, AN ORGANIZATIONS FUTURE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES SHOULD BE THE TRAINING MISSION, WITH THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL FRONT AND CENTER. IDEALLY, AN EMPLOYEES INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN WOULD MESHO WITH THE AGENCYS VISION AND ITS OPERATIONAL NECESSITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INDIVIDUALS CAREER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. A ROBUST AND WELL-DESIGNED TRAINING PROGRAM THAT CONSIDERS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND TALENT GAPS IS ALSO AN EFFECTIVE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL. CASE IN POINT AS A COLLEGE GRADUATE, I ENTERED A SOPHISTICATED ARMY CIVILIAN TRAINING PROGRAM IN WHAT HAS NOW EVOLVED INTO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. THAT PROGRAM INCLUDED MANDATORY CLASSES, FUNCTIONAL HUMAN RESOURCES TRAAINING, AND A TWO-YEAR ROTATIONAL ASSIGNMENT WITH A MANDATORY GEOGRAPHIC MOVE. FRTESH OUT OF COLLEGE, I DID NOT KNOW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF WORKING IN A FEDERAL ORGANIZATION, BUT THE TRAINING PROGRAM GAVE ME THE FOUNDATIONAL EDUCATION I NEEDED TO BOTH PERFORM MY JOB WELL AND ADVANCE MY FUTURE CAREER.  MATCHING METHOD TO GOALS AS FAR AS SPECIFIC LEARNING METHODS GO, NONE STAND OUT AS SUPERIOR. INDIVIDUAL NEEDS, LEARNING STYLES, AND ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN DECIDING WHICH EDUCATIONAL TOOLS WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES. FOR INSTANCE, TOTAL IMMERSION MAY NOT ALWAYS GIVE THE BEST RESULT, AS SOME EMPLOYEES MAY BE MORE APT TO LEARN IN A HANDS-ON ENVIRONMENT OR THROUGH SMALLER BURSTS OF INFORMATION. MEANWHILE, THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN INVACLUABLE AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE NETWORKING TOOL. CONSEQUENTLY, SPENDING TIME LEARNING WITH PEERS IN AN EMPLOYEES SAME DISCIPLINE OR AREA OF INTEREST CAN RESULT IN LASTING SKUPPORT AND SYNERGY THAT ENDURES THROUGHOUT AND BEYOND FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT. CLASSROOM INSTRUCTORS CAN ALSO SERVE AS VALUABLE RESOURCES FOR THE FUTURE. HOW ARE YOU DESIGNING YOUR TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MEET FUTURE AGENCY GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS?

661	LISBON, PORTUGAL CHELSEA BEGAN ITS EUROPEAN CAMPAIGN WITH A 4-0 HOME WIN OVER MACCABI TEL AVIV.  HALLOWEEN IS A FUN HOLIDAY THAT SHOULD BE ENJOYED BY ALL AGES, AND THE AGE LIMIT FOR TRICK-OR-TREATING SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN IN CHARGE, NOT THE EXPECTATIONS PLACED UPON US BY SOCIETY. NEXT UP, THOUGH, IS FC PORTO ON TUESDAY, AND THE BLUES HAVE IN THE PAST STRUGGLED AGAINST THE PORTUGUESE OUTFIT. MOURINHO HAS TWICE RETURNED TO HIS FORMER CLUB SINCE LEAVING IT FOR CHELSEA IN 2004, RECORDING A DEFEAT AND A DRAW IN HIS FIRST SPELL IN CHARGE OF THE ENGLISH CLUB. PORTO'S OPENING GROUP GAME BROUGHT A 2-2 DRAW AGAINST DYNAMO KIEV. IN THE OTHER GROUP G GAME, MACCABI TEL AVIV HOSTS DYNAMO KIEV. ---- OLD ANTAGONISTS MEET THERE COULD BE A FROSTY ATMOSPHERE AT PORTO'S ESTADIO DO DRAGAO WHEN MOURINHO AND IKER CASILLAS CROSS PATHS AGAIN. PORTO'S SPANISH GOALKEEPER MAY WELL BE BEARING A GRUDGE AGAINST THE CHELSEA COACH FROM THEIR TIME TOGETHER AT REAL MADRID. THEIR RELATIONS BECAME STRAINED IN 2012 WHEN THEN-REAL COACH MOURINHO SURPRISINGLY BENCHED THE LONGTIME SPAIN AND CLUB GOALKEEPER, CAUSING AN OUTCRY. CASILLAS, WHO MOVED TO PORTO FROM MADRID LAST SUMMER, WAS LEFT OFF REAL'S FIRST TEAM FOR FIVE MONTHS AND SAID THE EPISODE MADE HIM CRY. IT DIDN'T HURT HIS CAREER MUCH, THOUGH: HE IS POISED TO BECOME TUESDAY THE PLAYER WITH MOST CHAMPIONS LEAGUE APPEARANCES, OVERTAKING XAVI HERNANDEZ TO PLAY IN THE TOURNAMENT FOR THE 152ND TIME. MOURINHO WILL LIKELY GET ANOTHER WARM RECEPTION FROM PORTO FANS WHO REMEMBER HIM AS THE COACH WHO WON THEM THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IN 2004 THE PORTUGUESE CLUB'S SECOND EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS TROPHY.  KWAPNIEWSKI, BHGRE COCCIA REALTY'S PRESIDENT HAS ANNOUNCED. RADAMEL FALCAO, WHO PLAYED FOR PORTO FROM 2009-11, ALSO RETURNS IN CHELSEA COLORS. ---- DIFFERING FORM CHELSEA HAS STRUGGLED DOMESTICALLY THIS SEASON AND IT DREW 2-2 AGAINST TROUBLED NEWCASTLE UNITED AT THE WEEKEND. IT HAS A 2-2-3 RECORD AND HAS HALF AS MANY POINTS AS PREMIER LEAGUE LEADER MANCHESTER UNITED. WHILE THE DEFENDING ENGLISH CHAMPION'S CONFIDENCE IS DENTED, PORTO IS JOINT LEADER OF THE PORTUGUESE LEAGUE. PORTO IS UNDEFEATED IN SIX DOMESTIC GAMES AND IS ON A 12-MATCH UNBEATEN RUN IN ALL COMPETITIONS, THOUGH IT WAS SURPRISINGLY HELD TO A 2-2 DRAW BY MINNOW MOREIRENSE LAST WEEKEND. IN EUROPE, CHELSEA HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER PORTO WITH FOUR VICTORIES IN THE PREVIOUS SIX ENCOUNTERS, PORTO WINNING ONLY ONE. THE LONDON CLUB HAS WON EACH THE LAST THREE ENCOUNTERS, ALL BY A SINGLE GOAL. --- IN AND OUT (MAYBE) CHELSEA STRIKER DIEGO COSTA RECEIVED A THREE-MATCH RETROSPECTIVE BAN FOR VIOLENT CONDUCT AGAINST ARSENAL IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE BUT IS AVAILABLE FOR CHELSEA IN EUROPE AND IS EXPECTED TO LEAD THE ATTACK IN NORTHERN PORTUGAL. PORTO'S STANDOUT ATTACKING MIDFIELDER YACINE BRAHIMI HURT HIS KNEE IN THE WEEKEND GAME AND IS DOUBTFUL. ---- MACCABI'S BACK MACCABI TEL AVIV, BACK IN THE COMPETITION AFTER 11 YEARS AND HOSTING ITS FIRST CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GAME SINCE 2004, IS COMING OFF ITS FIRST WIN IN FOUR GAMES IN DOMESTIC COMPETITION. DYNAMO KIEV, WHICH IS BACK IN THE TOURNAMENT AFTER A TWO-SEASON ABSENCE, IS ON A 37-GAME UNBEATEN RUN IN UKRAINE.

"WE APOLOGIZE FOR OUR REMARKS AND WE KNOW HOW VITALLY IMPORTANT NURSES ARE." THEN BEHAR INVITED OUT "THE DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS FROM NYU COLLEGE OF NURSING TO SHARE FIRSTHAND WHAT THESE HARDWORKING NURSES DO ON A DAILY BASIS." WATCH: 'THE VIEW' HOSTS APOLOGIZE OVER CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS MADE ABOUT NURSES WHILE THE HIGHLIGHTING OF THE HARD WORK NURSES DO IS CERTAINLY WELCOME, SOME ON TWITTER SUGGESTED THE SHOW'S EFFORTS WERE A LITTLE INSINCERE. ONE FAN WROTE , "COULD THE LOSS OF [JOHNSON&JOHNSON] HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?" THE BACKLASH STARTED WHEN THE CO-HOSTS WERE RECAPPING LAST SUNDAY'S MISS AMERICA PAGEANT, WHEN MISS COLORADO KELLEY JOHNSON OPTED TO GIVE A MONOLOGUE ABOUT BEING A NURSE FOR THE TALENT PORTION OF THE PROGRAM. SHE CAME OUT IN A NURSES UNIFORM AND BASICALLY READ HER EMAILS OUT LOUD AND SHOCKINGLY DID NOT WIN, CO-HOST MICHELLE COLLINS JOKED. I WAS LIKE, THATS NOT A REAL TALENT. WATCH: VANESSA WILLIAMS MAKES TRIUMPHANT, MUSICAL RETURN TO MISS AMERICA WHY DOES SHE HAVE A DOCTORS STETHOSCOPE ON?" CO-HOST JOY BEHAR ADDED. BY WEDNESDAY, JOHNSON & JOHNSON, AND EGGLAND'S BEST BOTH DECIDED TO PULL THEIR ADVERTISING FROM THE PROGRAM. "JOHNSON & JOHNSON VALUES AND APPRECIATES NURSES AND WE RESPECT THE CRITICAL ROLE THEY PLAY IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM," THE COMPANY SAID ON ITS FACEBOOK PAGE.

IN A STATEMENT, EGGLAND'S BEST WROTE: "EGGLANDS BEST APPRECIATES NURSES AND VALUES THE IMPORTANT ROLE THEY PLAY IN FAMILY HEALTH. IN LIGHT OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE NURSING PROFESSION RECENTLY MADE ON DAYTIME TELEVISION WE WILL NO LONGER BE ADVERTISING ON THE SHOW IN QUESTION." "MY TALENT IS TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE, AND CARING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE," JOHNSON SAID ON THE ELLEN DEGENERES SHOW ON WEDNESDAY. "I THOUGHT, 'YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GO UP THERE AND I WANT TO BE AUTHENTIC. I WANT TO BE KELLEY.'" "AND IF IM EVER GOING TO WIN MISS AMERICA, I WANT TO DO IT BEING MYSELF," SHE ADDED. "AND IM A NURSE!" WATCH: WHOOPI SAYS ROSIE O'DONNELL WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO 'THE VIEW' ON WEDNESDAY, THE VIEW HOSTS APOLOGIZED FOR THE CONTROVERSY. CO-HOST MICHELLE COLLINS SAID, "WE LOVE NURSES. WE ADORE YOU. WE RESPECT YOU. YOU GUYS ARE WONDERFUL. YOURE THE MOST COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE. I WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT NURSES, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TALENT COMPETITION, AND IT GOT MISCONSTRUED." BEHAR ADDED THAT SHE WAS "JUST NOT PAYING ATTENTION," SAYING, "I WAS LOOKING AT A MISS AMERICA TAPE, AND THERES A WOMAN WEARING AN OUTFIT WITH A STETHOSCOPE, AND IM THINKING IS SHE IN A COSTUME?" "I DIDNT KNOW SHE WAS A NURSE," SHE SAID. "IM USED TO SEEING THEM IN GOWNS AND BATHING SUITS." WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE VIEW' S ATTEMPTS TO MAKE AMENDS WITH NURSES? YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE MOST POPULAR
663	MANCHESTER UNITED WELCOME THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE BACK TO OLD TRAFFORD ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN LOUIS VAN GAAL'S MEN HOST GERMAN CLUB WOLFSBURG IN THEIR GROUP B CLASH. THE GAME WILL BE THE CLUB'S FIRST HOME MATCH IN THE TOURNAMENT SINCE THEY LOST TO BAYERN MUNICH AT OLD TRAFFORD IN 2014, AND THE RED DEVILS WILL BE LOOKING FOR A WIN AFTER SUFFERING DEFEAT IN THEIR OPENING CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MATCH AWAY TO PSV EINDHOVEN. THAT GAME SAW UNITED SURRENDER A 1-0 LEAD BEFORE EVENTUALLY BEING BEATEN 2-1, BUT IT WILL PERHAPS BE MORE REMEMBERED FOR THE HORROR TACKLE THAT LEFT LUKE SHAW WITH A DOUBLE FRACTURE OF HIS LEG - AND OUT FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME. DESPITE BEING WITHOUT THE FULL-BACK FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, UNITED WILL BE IN A CONFIDENT MOOD AHEAD OF THEIR CLASH WITH WOLFSBURG AFTER GOING TOP OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE ON SUNDAY WITH A 3-0 WIN OVER SUNDERLAND. THEIR RECENT STRING OF VICTORIES HAS LED TO UNITED MIDFIELDER BASTIAN SCHWEINSTEIGER ADMITTING THE CLUB HAVE THE STRENGTH TO WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE ALTHOUGH THEIR OPPOSITION ON WEDNESDAY WON'T BE EASY TO BEAT . WOLFSBURG SIT IN FOURTH PLACE IN THE BUNDESLIGA STANDINGS, BUT SUFFERED AN EMBARRASSING 5-1 THRASHING AT THE HANDS OF BAYERN MUNICH LAST WEEK, WHICH SAW ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI SCORE FIVE GOALS IN NINE SECOND-HALF MINUTES TO STUN THE VISITORS AT THE ALLIANZ ARENA. HOWEVER, WOLFSBURG COACH DIETER HECKING INSISTED ON TUESDAY HE ISNT WORRIED BY THE PROSPECT OF COMING TO OLD TRAFFORD AND TRYING TO SECURE A RESULT ALTHOUGH HE CONCEDED IT WILL NOT BE EASY. BUT WHO WILL COME OUT ON TOP? STAY TUNED TO STANDARD SPORT FOR ALL THE ACTION! PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT FOR THE LIVE BLOG TO LOAD WHAT THEY SAID VAN GAAL "I HAVE TO CONSIDER IF I WANT TO USE THESE PLAYERS," HETOLD MUTV. "WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PLAYERS BECAUSE WE ARE PLAYING THREE MATCHES EVERY WEEK. "IT'S THE ACCUMULATION OF TIREDNESS - WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT. I HAVE TO CONSIDER EVERY WEEK IF I CAN USE A PLAYER OR NOT. NOW HERRERA, CARRICK AND VALENCIA HAVE MINOR ISSUES. WE HAVE TO TAKE A DECISION AND I WILL TAKE THAT, MORE OR LESS, ON WEDNESDAY."

JUST AS THE SEASON FINALE WAS GETTING UNDERWAY, BAIRD TWEETEDTHAT HE WAS STUCK AT HOME "WITH THE MAN-FLU", AND THAT HIS DAUGHTERS HAD COMANDEERED THE TV TO FIND OUT WHETHER BACHIE SAM WOULD GIVE HIS FINAL ROSE TOSNEZANA OR LANA.

AS THE INTERNET SAID, SNEZ MAY HAVE WON THE BACHELOR'S HEART, BUT MIKE BAIRD WON THE BACHELOR FINALE. HE SEEMS VERY SINCERE FOR A GUY WHO IS TWO-TIMING, LIVE ON TV.

665	LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY & THECURE IS CURIOSITY. HOW SEEKING CHANGE HAS BROUGHT ME EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEENLOOKING FOR. IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING MY JOURNEY, CHECK OUT THE PREVIOUS PIECES OF THE STORY HERE: WK1 , WK2 , WK3 , WK4 WEVE ALL HEARD THE SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, DOES IT MAKE A SOUND? THIS QUESTION DRAWSON MANY NOTIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE SELF, AND THAT IF ONE DOES NOT EXPERIENCE SOMETHING, THAN THE QUESTION IS DID ITREALLY HAPPEN? BUT LETS GO BACK AND THINK INSTEAD OF THIS SCENARIO: IF LIGHTING STRIKES IN THE WOODS AND STARTS A FIRE, BUT NO ONE IS AROUND TO SEE IT, WILL IT STILL BURN A PART OF THE FOREST DOWN? THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS YES.  JOAN EDMUNDSSON CLAIMED THE FAEROES' ONLY GOAL BUT PICKED UP A SECOND YELLOW CARD AS THE HOME SIDE PLAYED THE FINAL 25 MINUTES WITH 10 MEN.  ON THE FIELD, IT PRETTY MUCH WENT THAT WAY IN AN 8-3 LOSS. OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY DOES NOT DICTATE WHAT IS REAL, BUT MERELY WHAT WE ARE PERCEIVING AS AN ACTIVE PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE EXIST. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES, HOW DO WE INCLUDE THIS LIGHTNING STRIKE IN OUR LIVES SO THAT WE CAN BE AN ACTIVE FORCE IN STOPPING THE FOREST FIRE? THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. SINCE WE CANT CHANGE WHERE THE LIGHTNING STRIKES, WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE OUT LOOKING FOR IT. IN SHORT, IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD, WE HAVE TO BE AN ACTIVE PIECE IN IT. OUR BODIES ARE TEMPLES FOR OUR MINDS FLESHY PRISONS WITH WHICH WE TRAVERSE THIS LIFE IN ORDER TO SEEK BALANCE AND PEACE AND FREEDOM. HOWEVER, IN THIS BELIEF, OUR BODIES ARE STILL PLAYERS IN THE GAME OF LIFE; THEY ARE THETEMPLE WITHIN WHICH OUR MINDS RESIDE, SO SHOULDNT WE BE TREATING OUR TEMPLES LIKE TEMPLES?! AND BY THIS, I MEAN TO PUSH OUR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND STAMINA TO THEIR LIMITS AND TO SEEK CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT ON THIS PHYSICAL FORM IN WHICH EXIST.  LETS PLAY THE WHAT IF GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS: WHAT IF YOU ARE WALKING TO YOUR CAR AND THREE PEOPLE GET THE DROP ON YOU; COULD YOU DEFEND YOURSELF? WHAT IF YOUR HOME CATCHES ON FIRE AND THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THE SECOND STORY WINDOW; DO YOU KNOW HOW TO JUMP AND LAND SAFELY? WHAT IF YOUR SON WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM? WHAT IF YOU WORKED A FEW MINUTES FROM HOME AND YOUR WIFE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND NEEDED YOU HOME IMMEDIATELY,BUT YOUR CAR WAS DEAD IN THE PARKING LOT, COULD YOU RUN ALL THE WAY HOME? CAN YOU PROTECT THE ONES YOU LOVE? COULD YOU OUTRUN SOMETHING HUNTING YOU DOWN? CAN YOU SURVIVE ON YOUR OWN WHEN TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE WITHIN REACH TO HELP YOU? I SPENT THE WEEK PRACTICING HUAQUAN AND RUNNING. MY BEST FRIEND, ALSO AN ADVENTURE ENTHUSIAST, AND I SPENT THE WEEKENDCLIMBING THROUGH AERIAL OBSTACLE COURSES IN THE TREES OF THE BERKSHIRES IN MASSACHUSETTS.AFTER THE LONG WEEKEND, I BEGAN THE WEEK LIKE I ALWAYS DO, EXHAUSTED; BUT I COULD FEEL THE HAPPINESS IN EACH SORE MUSCLE FIBER. THE ELONGATED SIGH AS ONE SETTLES IN TO THE COUCH AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, OR INTO A HOT TUB ON THE FIRST DAY OF VACATION, THAT IS WHAT EACH OF MY MUSCLES FEELS.  LA CLOSERIE DES LILAS WAS ONE OF ERNEST HEMINGWAYS FAVORITE CAFS TO WRITE IN.  THE PROBLEM AT THIS POINT IS THAT THE SEAHAWKS JUST ARENT GOOD ENOUGH TO PLAY SO DUMB. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUSAAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. SO WHAT HAS THIS SHOWN ME? WELL FIRST, LETS RECAP THE RECENT FOUR WEEKS CHALLENGES: I HAVE BEGUN TO REFINE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SINCE I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY. MY GIRLFRIEND STARTED A NEW JOB AS A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHICH REQUIRES HER TO BE WAKING UP AT 3:30AM MOST MORNINGS (LAST NIGHT WE AWOKE AT 1:45AM). I HAVE BEGUN TO WAKE UP WITH HER, AS OPPOSED TO 6AM, AND ENSURE THAT HER BREAKFAST/ LUNCH ARE READY FOR THE DAY.  LISBON, APRIL. I DONT WORK OUT FOR TWO HOURS, BUT FOR A HALF AN HOUR: A WARM UP ROUTINE CONSISTING OF PUSH UPS, SIT UPS, LEG RAISES, AND TRICEP DIPS. I SPEND THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING IMMERSED IN THE ONLINE WORLD CHECKING EMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS, NETWORKING, WORKING ON WRITING/ EDITING, OR SOME MORNINGS JUST GAMING.  THOSE THAT ARE AFRAID OF CHANGE GET LEFT IN THE DUST. MILAN KUNDERA, CZECH BORN EXISTENTIAL WRITER, POSED THAT: ANYONE WHOSE GOAL IS SOMETHING HIGHER MUST EXPECT SOMEDAY TO SUFFER VERTIGO. WHAT IS VERTIGO? FEAR OF FALLING? NO, VERTIGO IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN FEAR OF FALLING. IT IS THE VOICE OF THE EMPTINESS BELOW US WHICH TEMPTS AND LURES US, IT IS THE DESIRE TO FALL, AGAINST WHICH, TERRIFIED, WE DEFEND OURSELVES. I TIME LAST WEEK WORKING ON EXACTLY WHAT I SET OUT TO DO. I DREW UP A BUSINESS PLAN FOR LAUNCHING MY OWN COMPANY.OVER THE COURSE THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE RESEARCHED SIMILAR PEOPLE TO MYSELF AND THEIR VENTURES. THE VERDICT IS IN: STARTING OUT ON YOUR OWN IS DIFFICULT; IN WAYS THAT I COULD SIT HERE AND DESCRIBE TO YOU, BUT I DONT WANT YOU TO BE AFRAID OF EVER DOING IT.IT REQUIRES PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE AND A LOT OF HARD WORK.  MAYBE THE BEST $7 YOULL SPEND ALL WEEK! AS ANAIS NIN WROTE, LIFE SHRINKS OR EXPANDS IN PROPORTION TO ONES COURAGE. IF YOU DESIRE STRONGLY ENOUGH AND POSSESS THE PROPER COURAGE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. I PRESENTED MYBUSINESS PLAN TO MY BEST FRIEND OVER COFFEE. WE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF MY PLAN. IT WILL REQUIRE HUGE EFFORT AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR FREE TIME. HOWEVER, AFTER MUCH DELIBERATING, WE HAVE DECIDED TO PURSUE THIS AVENUE AS A MEANS TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE.IT WILL STILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE BUILD UP A PLATFORM FROM WHICH WE CAN LAUNCH. FOR NOW, THIS MEANSTHAT THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS OF MY JOURNEY HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS IM WELL ON THE WAY TO LOVING MY LIFE AND FINDING MORE AND MORE WAYS TO BATTLE MY DEPRESSION WHEN IT REARS ITS UGLY HEAD! HOWEVER, IM NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS METAPHOR, THATS A GOOD THING. THE ONLY WAY IN LIFE WE COULD EVER HEAR THAT TREE FALL, OR STOP THAT FOREST FIRE, IS TO BE PRESENT; AND THAT MEANS PUTTING YOURSELF INTO SITUATIONS THAT YOU WOULDNT NORMALLY BE IN. THOUGH WHAT IS NORMAL? THE TREND OF A THING TO REMAIN AT A CONSTANT ACCEPTED BY A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN PLACE. BECAUSE NORMAL FOR YOU MAY NOT BE NORMAL FOR ME. BECAUSE NORMAL ALL OVER THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT. SO GO LEARN ABOUT OTHER NORMALS. LIVE. JOURNEY. ADVENTURE.  CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION IS CHARGED WITH PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM UNREASONABLE RISKS OF INJURY OR DEATH ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THOUSANDS OF TYPES OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS UNDER THE AGENCY'S JURISDICTION. ALL OF LIFE IS ADVENTURE. BUT DYLLON, I DONT HAVE THE TIME TO BE ADVENTURING, OR STARTING NEW THINGS IM AN INDOORS GUY, GOING OUT AND ADVENTURING JUST ISNT FOR ME I LIVE IN A CITY, WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND A TREE IN A CITY IN 2015? THESE ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS. BUT OTHER THAN THE LAST GUY WHO IS STILL CAUGHT UP ON THE TREE METAPHOR, KEEP IN MIND WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY, ADVENTURE. TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER ANY TIME PERIOD IN YOUR LIFE. OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE REMEMBERING THE TIME PERIOD BASED ON THE EVENTS. YOU DONT REMEMBER EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR DAYS BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE WASNT EXCITING; EVERY MINUTE DIDNT LEAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION ON YOU. WHAT STANDS OUT IN LIFE WHAT REALLY GIVES YOU ENERGY AND MAKES YOU GO IS THE UNUSUAL, THE CHANGE, & THE AWESOME. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. WALKING TO THE BATHROOM ON YOUR HANDS. BUILDING A FORT WITH YOUR KIDS. COOKING A FOREIGN DISH FOR AROUND THE WORLD NIGHT FOR YOUR WIFE. SEEING A TREND? REMEMBER: CHALLENGING YOURSELF WILL ONLY PRODUCE POSITIVE EFFECTS. NEW EXPERIENCES CAN ONLY CAUSE US TO GROW. THUSLY, MY CHALLENGE FOR THIS UPCOMING WEEK WILL BE TO ADVENTURE AT LEAST ONCE A DAY, AND DO SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING AT LEAST ONCEEACH WEEK. LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY, AND THE CURE IS CURIOSITY. CURIOSITY IS THE FUEL OF THE SOUL. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU ARE NOT SURE WHERE TO START, WRITE OR TWEET TO ME! AND COME BACK FOR NEXT WEEKS ARTICLE!

666	SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THE 264-KM-ROUTE LAST YEAR, TRIALS ARE BEING HELD ON A DAILY BASIS, CONDUCTED BY ETIHAD RAILS OPERATING PARTNER, ERDB. FULL COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO START SHORTLY ONCE ETIHAD RAIL IS GRANTED ITS REGULATORY APPROVALS, THUS LEADING TO A SIGNIFICANT JUMP IN THE VOLUME OF SULPHUR TRANSPORTED BY RAIL IN 2016 AND BEYOND, SAID A SENIOR OFFICIAL. TRANSPORTING OVER TWO MILLION TONNES OF SULPHUR IN THE PAST YEAR DURING OUR TESTING AND COMMISSIONING AND TRIAL OPERATIONS PHASES IS A VERY PROUD ACHIEVEMENT FOR ETIHAD RAIL, OUR OPERATING PARTNER, ERDB, AND THE UAE AS A WHOLE, AS IT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES OUR UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION AS A RELIABLE, SAFE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MODE OF TRANSPORT, REMARKED ITS CEO FARIS SAIF AL MAZROUEI. OUR SUCCESS TO DATE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT OF OUR CUSTOMER AND PARTNER, ADNOC, HE STATED. TODAYS ANNOUNCEMENT OFFERS AN INSIGHT INTO THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THAT THE FEDERAL RAILWAY NETWORK WILL BRING TO THE UAE, WITH ETIHAD RAILS TRAINS HAVING ALREADY REPLACED MORE THAN 66,000 TRUCK TRIPS FROM THE ROADS IN THE WESTERN REGION OF ABU DHABI IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, SAID THE COMPANY IN ITS STATEMENT. THE ETIHAD RAIL PROJECT IS BEING DELIVERED IN THREE KEY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. IT WILL BE USED TO TRANSPORT BULK AND NON-BULK MATERIALS, OFFERING TAILOR-MADE SOLUTIONS TO DIFFERING CUSTOMER NEEDS. NETWORK ROUTES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE ALL KEY CUSTOMER SECTORS, WITH FREIGHT FACILITIES POSITIONED TO CONNECT PRODUCTION HUBS WITH POINTS OF IMPORT AND EXPORT, SAID THE STATEMENT. ETIHAD RAIL SAID ITS FLEET COMPRISES SEVEN LOCOMOTIVES AND 240 HOPPER WAGONS AND OPERATES TO TRANSPORT GRANULATED SULPHUR FROM TWO PLANTS IN SHAH AND HABSHAN IN THE WESTERN REGION OF ABU DHABI TO ITS TERMINAL AT RUWAIS PORT. ONCE COMPLETED, THE ETIHAD RAIL NETWORK WILL SPAN APPROXIMATELY 1,200 KM ACROSS THE UAE, CONNECTING URBAN AND PERIPHERAL COMMUNITIES, FACILITATING TRADE, OPENING UP COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND FOSTERING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, STATED AL MAZROUEI. IT WILL ALSO FORM A VITAL PART OF THE GCC RAILWAY NETWORK, LINKING THE UAE TO SAUDI ARABIA THROUGH GHWEIFAT IN THE WEST AND OMAN THROUGH AL AIN IN THE EAST, NOTED THE OFFICIAL. GOING FORWARD, WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THIS SUCCESS AS WE MOVE TOWARDS OUR TARGET OF TRANSPORTING MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION TONNES OF SULPHUR EVERY YEAR ONCE WE ENTER INTO FULL COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, HE ADDED.
667	UPDATED - THE RISK OF ENDURING ANOTHER PREMATURE BIRTH IS VERY REAL FOR MARTINE*, WHO IS SIX MONTHS PREGNANT WITH HER SECOND CHILD. HER FIRST WAS BORN SEVEN WEEKS TOO EARLY AFTER A BEATING FROM HER EX-PARTNER FORCED HER INTO A HOSPITAL BED AND CONSEQUENTLY LABOUR. SIX YEARS LATER MARTINE, 29, HAS A NEW RELATIONSHIP AND A NEW BABY ON THE WAY BUT THE ABUSE HAS NOT STOPPED FROM HER EX-PARTNER, WHO CONTINUES TO HARASS HER DAILY. MARTINE IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY WOMEN IN AUSTRALIA WHOSE PREGNANCY HAS TRIGGERED YEARS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST THEM AND THEIR CHILD. DESPITE LEAVING THE MAN WHO BEAT HER INTO EARLY LABOUR, MARTINE FEARS HIS CONSTANT HARASSMENT COULD FORCE ANOTHER PREMATURE BIRTH. "HE HAS THREATENED MY LIFE, KILLED ANIMALS IN MY YARD, THREATENS ANY NEW RELATIONSHIP I START TO THE POINT WHERE PARTNERS HAVE LEFT ME," SHE SAYS. MARTINE HAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORDER IN PLACE, BUT SAYS HER EX-PARTNER HAS CHANGED HIS METHODS OF HARASSMENT TO AVOID GETTING CAUGHT. "MY TYRES HAVE BEEN LET DOWN, HIS CAR CONSTANTLY DRIVES PAST MY HOME, AND I KEEP GETTING PRIVATE NUMBERS CALLING MY PHONE. JUST THIS MORNING I HAD A CALL AND I KNOW IT'S HIM," SHE SAYS.  DUST, MUD, THE BOOTS OF A CROWDSURFER AND AN AIRBOURNE CUP OF BEER HAVE A WAY OF FINDING YOU THE TIME YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LENS. "I HAVE HAD TO CHANGE MY PHONE NUMBER SIX TIMES." HAVING ALREADY BEEN THROUGH A PRE-TERM BIRTH AND LIVING WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS, MARTINE'S PREGNANCY IS CLASSIFIED AS BEING HIGH-RISK. HOWEVER, AT SIX MONTHS PREGNANT SHE HAS TO DEFEND HERSELF IN COURT FROM HER EX-PARTNER, WHO HAS MADE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT HER FITNESS TO PARENT THEIR CHILD. "I'M SCARED THE STRESS OF ALL THE COURT CASES COULD TRIGGER ANOTHER PRE-TERM LABOUR," SHE SAID. "HE SAID 'I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL YOU DIE SO I CAN PISS ON YOUR GRAVE'. I KNOW HE WANTS ME OUT OF THE PICTURE ANY WAY POSSIBLE." "HE HAS MADE MY LIFE HELL, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY." A STRING OF WOMEN'S DEATHS CAUSED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN EARLY SEPTEMBER HAS PROMPTED MORE WOMEN TO SPEAK OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES. SARAH*, 26, FOUGHT BACK TEARS AS SHE DESCRIBED HEARING ABOUT THE RECENT SPATE OF ATTACKS AGAINST WOMEN. "IT COULD HAVE BEEN ME," SHE SAYS, REFERRING TO KARINA LOCK WHO WAS SHOT DEAD AT A MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT ON THE GOLD COAST. LOCK'S WAS ONE OF THREE LIVES LOST TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN A HORROR WEEK FOR QUEENSLAND. SARAH IS PERMANENTLY DISABLED FROM HER ABUSIVE EX-PARTNER AND, LIKE MANY WOMEN, THE VIOLENCE WAS EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY. "IT JUST DIDN'T STOP. HE PUSHED SO HARD ONE TIME THAT WHEN I HIT THE FLOOR I TORE DISCS IN MY SPINE. I HAD TO HAVE DISC REPLACEMENT AND A SPINAL FUSION. I HAD TO LEARN TO WALK AGAIN," SHE SAYS, HER VOICE BREAKING AS SHE DESCRIBES HER DAILY STRUGGLE. "I WAKE EVERY DAY IN PAIN. I WILL NEVER RUN COMFORTABLY. AND WHEN MY KIDS WANT ME TO PLAY, I CAN'T. I'M IN TOO MUCH PAIN." SARAH SAYS SHE IS HARASSED DAILY AND ADMITS SHE FEARS FOR HER LIFE; SHE SAYS THE POLICE HAVE IGNORED HER CONCERNS. "HE [EX-PARTNER] HAS TOLD ME HE WANTS TO KILL HIS EX-WIFE. HE HAS TOLD ME THE WAYS HE WANTS TO DO IT. BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE POLICE THEY SAID IT'S NORMAL FOR PEOPLE TO SAY THEY WANT TO KILL THEIR EX-PARTNERS, AND IT IS A COMMON FIGURE OF SPEECH." NEARLY A QUARTER OF AUSTRALIAN WOMEN SAY THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME FORM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHILST THEY WERE PREGNANT AND HALF OF THEM EXPERIENCED ABUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING THAT PERIOD. JULIE-ANN, 28, IS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING PREGNANCY. "THE ABUSE BEGAN NINE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS 12 WEEKS PREGNANT," JULIE-ANN SAYS, SPEAKING OUT ABOUT HER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME.  JULIE-ANN EXPERIENCED ABUSE FOR NINE AND A HALF YEARS FOLLOWING THE FIRST PREGNANCY THROUGH FEAR OF LEAVING. EVENTUALLY SHE ESCAPED AND MOVED INTERSTATE. "IT FELT SAFER TO STAY," SHE SAYS ABOUT HER NINE YEARS OF ABUSE. "BECAUSE HE WOULD LOSE CONTROL. IF I WAS AWAY I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS, WHAT HE WAS THINKING, OR WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO." FAMILY VIOLENCE ACADEMIC DEBORAH WALSH HAS SPECIFICALLY STUDIED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREGNANCY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SAYS PREGNANCY OFTEN OFFERS HOPE THAT AN ABUSIVE PARTNER WILL CHANGE.  THE ORCHESTRA IS BEING ASSEMBLED WITH THE HELP OF A CONTRACTOR, SHE SAID, AND IS COMPRISED OF A LOT OF FAITH-FILLED PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCITED TO BE HERE. "A BABY OFFERS HOPE FOR THE FUTURE AND A HOPE FOR CHANGE," MS WALSH SAID. MS WALSH SAID DUE TO THIS HOPE WOMEN HAVE WHILE PREGNANT MANY PROCESSES INVOLVED IN SCREENING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WOULD NOT BE TOTALLY EFFECTIVE. "WE NEED TO SUPPORT MEN IN OUR COMMUNITY TO MANAGE THEIR FEELINGS APPROPRIATELY, SAFELY, AND NON-VIOLENTLY, IN A WAY THAT IT IS NOT SEEN AS AN ATTACK ON MASCULINITY, BUT INSTEAD A PART OF MASCULINITY," MS WALSH SAID. "UNLESS WE SUPPORT OUR MEN (TO) DEAL WITH THEIR EMOTIONS, FEELINGS AND ASSOCIATED BEHAVIOURS, THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE." DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION CENTRE DIRECTOR AMY COMPTON-KEEN SAID PREGNANCY AND POST-BIRTH WERE BOTH VULNERABLE TIMES FOR WOMEN AND IT WAS COMMON FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO OCCUR AT THESE TIMES. "MANY PREGNANT WOMEN DO NOT REPORT, DISCLOSE, OR SEEK HELP DUE TO FEELING VULNERABLE AND UNCERTAIN OF THE FUTURE," MS COMPTON-KEEN SAID. "THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE MAY INCLUDE PERIODS WHERE THEIR PARTNER IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE, THEIR CHILD, AND BECOMING A PARENT, AND THEY MAY MAKE PROMISES. "THESE PROMISES ARE POWERFUL AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A WOMAN REMAINING IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP." PEOPLE WHO MAY BE DISTRESSED CAN PHONE LIFELINE ON 131 114.

668	JAPAN DONT TIP ANYONE: TIPPING IS JUST NOT PART OF THE CULTURE. DONT EVEN LEAVE THE SMALL CHANGE. PEOPLE WILL COME RUNNING AFTER YOU WITH IT. DONT WEAR YOUR SHOES IN SOMEONES HOUSE: IF YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE TAKING THEIR SHOES OFF, DO THE SAME. (NOTE: THERES A SMALL AREA RIGHT INSIDE THE ENTRANCE CALLED A GENKAN WHICH IS USUALLY ONE LEVEL BELOW THE REST OF THE HOUSE, WHERE YOU TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES. YOU DONT TAKE THEM OFF OUTSIDE THE HOUSE!) DONT HUG PEOPLE YOU JUST MET: MOST PEOPLE DONT LIKE IT, ESPECIALLY OLDER FOLK. DONT STAND ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ESCALATOR: IN TOKYO YOU STAND ON THE LEFT. IN OSAKA YOU STAND ON THE RIGHT. FOLLOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING. GERMANY DONT DO THE NAZI SALUTE: NOT EVEN IN JEST. ITS A CRIME AND EVERY YEAR THERE ARE TOURISTS ARRESTED FOR IT. ALSO DONT CARRY ANY NAZI SYMBOLS ON YOU. DONT STARE: YOUD APPEAR EITHER UNEDUCATED OR MENTALLY ILL. DONT BE OVERLY FRIENDLY: GERMANS LIKE TO GRADUALLY WARM UP TO PEOPLE AND TAKE TIME TO REALLY GET TO KNOW THEM BEFORE ACTING LIKE BFFS. DONT WISH SOMEONE A HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEFORE THE ACTUAL DAY: THE ORIGIN IS A SUPERSTITION THAT SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO THEM (THEY MIGHT DIE) BEFORE THEIR BIRTHDAY IF YOU DO, HOWEVER THIS RULE IS NOT LIMITED TO SUPERSTITIOUS PEOPLE. EVEN BRIGHT, RATIONAL GERMANS WILL FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE ITS JUST NOT DONE. NORWAY DONT STARE AT NAKED PEOPLE: PEOPLE ARE PRETTY RELAXED ABOUT NUDITY, AND BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WILL FOR EXAMPLE CHANGE ON PUBLIC BEACHES WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT COVERING THEMSELVES UP. YOU ARE HOWEVER EXPECTED TO LOOK AWAY. DONT UNWRAP FLOWERS BEFORE YOU GIVE THEM AS A GIFT: GERMANS DO THIS. DONT ASK PEOPLE ABOUT CHURCH: MOST ATTEND NONE, AND ASKING THIS IS SEEN AS INTRUSIVE, RUDE AND DOWNRIGHT WEIRD. DONT EXPECT SPECIAL TREATMENT: PEOPLE ARE VERY INFORMAL HERE AND BEING ON A FIRST-NAME-BASIS WITH ANYONE SHORT OF THE KING IS THE NORM. EVEN THE PRIME-MINISTER OF NORWAY IS MOST OFTEN REFERRED TO BY FIRST NAME. RUSSIA DONT GIVE AN EVEN NUMBER OF FLOWERS AS A GIFT: THATS FOR DEAD FOLKS. PROPER BOUQUET WILL HAVE 1/3/5/7 FLOWERS. DONT RELY ON A CREDIT CARD: THERE ARE LOTS OF PLACES WHICH ONLY ACCEPT CASH. DONT ASSUME THE PEOPLE SUPPORT EVERYTHING THE GOVERNMENT DOES: QUITE OFTEN WE DONT. DONT CRITICIZE OUR GOVERNMENT. WE DO IT A LOT BY OURSELVES, WE DONT NEED YOUR HELP IN THAT. SINGAPORE YOU CAN GET FINED FOR A LOT OF THINGS IN SINGAPORE, INCLUDING: FEEDING THE BIRDS, SPITTING, URINATING IN PUBLIC, SMOKING IN PUBLIC, HAVING YOUR PET IN PUBLIC, EATING OR DRINKING ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, AND LITTERING, AMONG OTHER THINGS. KENYA DONT DISRESPECT RELIGION: ALMOST EVERYONE YOU MEET IS RELIGIOUS; RELIGION HERE IS ALWAYS IN FASHION, SO IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU IF YOU ARE RELIGIOUS, DONT TAKE OFFENSE BECAUSE IT IS COMMON FOR EVERYONE TO FOLLOW A RELIGION, AND AROUND 80% OF THE POPULATION ARE CHRISTIANS. DONT BE IMPATIENT: HARDLY ANYTHING RUNS ON TIME, WITH AN EXCEPTION OF A COUPLE OF BUSINESS MEETINGS AND BANK CLOSING HOURS AND MOST OTHER BUSINESSES. EVERYTHING RUNS LATE, DONT GET PISSED OFF OR IMPATIENT, LEARN TO GO WITH THE FLOW, THINGS WILL HAPPEN, JUST NOT ON TIME. DONT TALK ABOUT SEX IN MIXED COMPANY: IT IS WRONG AND IS FROWNED UPON AND PEOPLE MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE IN YOUR COMPANY AFTER THAT. DONT CALL SOMEONE BY THEIR FIRST NAME: MISS, MRS, MR., DR. AND ENGINEER SO AND SO (MOSTLY THE SURNAME) ARE TOTALLY ACCEPTED. IF YOU WANT TO CALL SOMEONE WHOSE NAME YOU DONT KNOW, REFER TO THEM AS MADAM OR SIR. YOU GET QUITE A LOT OF BONUS POINTS FOR THAT. ONLY REFER TO SOMEONE BY THEIR FIRST NAME IF THEY INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AS SUCH. NEW ZEALAND DONT CONFUSE NEW ZEALANDERS WITH AUSSIES: WE DONT LIKE IT! DONT EXPECT TO SEE KIWI BIRDS: THEY ARE ALMOST EXTINCT. IRONY! DONT MAKE FUN OF RUGBY, LORD OF THE RINGS, OR THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND: ALL BLACKS IS A RUGBY TEAM AND PROBABLY A RELIGION. HAKA IS A WAR-CRY PERFORMED BEFORE A WAR OR, NOWADAYS, A RUGBY MATCH. DO NOT MAKE FUN OF IT! KIWIS ARE PROUD OF LORD OF THE RINGS! THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND IS STILL A BIG DEAL HERE! WE STILL CELEBRATE HER BIRTHDAY AND SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO HER. DONT FREAK OUT ABOUT PEOPLE NOT WEARING SHOES: ITS PERFECTLY NORMAL TO GO ABOUT IN PUBLIC PLACES WITHOUT FOOTWEAR, AND IN SOME CASES A SHIRT. YOU WILL STILL BE SERVED. TURKEY DONT MAKE THE OKAY SIGN WITH YOUR THUMB AND FOREFINGER: THIS IS CONSIDERED OBSCENE IN TURKEY. LAY OFF THE ALCOHOL: TURKS DONT DRINK MUCH MAYBE AN OCCASIONAL GLASS OF WINE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND BEING DRUNK IS CONSIDERED A DISGRACE. DONT BLOW YOUR NOSE OR PICK YOUR TEETH IN PUBLIC: TURKS CONSIDER BOTH OF THESE IMPOLITE WHEN DONE AT A RESTAURANT, CAFE, OR BAR. INDIA DONT KISS IN PUBLIC: IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THIS CAN GET YOU INTO JAIL UNDER PUBLIC OBSCENITY (A LOT OF OUR LAWS ARE STUCK IN THE VICTORIAN ERA). DONT MAKE PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX: HUGGING AND HANDSHAKES ARE STILL FROWNED UPON IN MOST PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AMONG MEMBERS OF OPPOSITE SEX. UNLESS THE LOCAL OFFERS TO HUG OR HANDSHAKE, DONT. FRANCE DONT EXPECT A HUGE AMOUNT OF VEGAN OPTIONS: NOTIFY PEOPLE YOU VISIT AND BE CAREFUL IN WHICH RESTAURANTS YOU GO. VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE VEGAN IN FRANCE COMPARED TO SOME OTHER COUNTRIES, AND ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION IS SLOWLY IMPROVING, THE AWARENESS AND ACCEPTANCE OF IT ARE STILL QUITE POOR. SOME OLDER PEOPLE ESPECIALLY CAN CONSIDER IT A WEIRD OR EVEN RADICAL BEHAVIOR. DONT TALK ABOUT MONEY: FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN TELL YOU QUIT A JOB BECAUSE YOU WERE UNDERPAID, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT MENTION HOW MUCH EXACTLY. THERE ARE OLD TABOOS ABOUT SPEAKING OF MONEY IN THE FRENCH CULTURE, MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER IT A DIRTY TOPIC. DONT EXPECT PEOPLE TO SPEAK ENGLISH: THE FRENCH EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS BAD AT TEACHING FOREIGN LANGUAGES, WITH AN EXCESSIVE FOCUS ON READING AND WRITING COMPARED TO CONVERSATIONAL SKILLS. MANY OLDER PEOPLE WILL ONLY KNOW A BIT OF BAD AND HEAVILY ACCENTED ENGLISH AND/OR POSSIBLY GERMAN OR SPANISH. MEXICO DONT PATRONIZE PEOPLE: WERE A DEVELOPING COUNTRY AND WERE AWARE THAT SOME STUFF IS JUST BACKWARDS OVER HERE. DONT EVER IMPLY THAT YOU ARE BETTER THAN ANYONE, ESPECIALLY IF THAT HINGES ON YOU BEING A FOREIGNER. DONT BE EASILY OFFENDED: WE HAVE A HUGE SENSE OF HUMOR AS A CULTURE. NOTHING IS OUT OF BOUNDS FOR US! WELL MOCK, RIDICULE, INSULT, PICK ON AND PUT DOWN JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT, ON A REGULAR BASIS! DONT BE AFRAID TO TRY EVERYTHING: WE LOVE IT WHEN YOU TRY TO SAY THAT RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT WORD IN SPANISH, AND YOULL BE MET WITH PROUD CHEERS IF YOU BRAVE A BITE OUT OF THAT HORRIFYINGLY SPICY PEPPER, OR DOWN THAT SHOT OF TEQUILA. UNITED KINGDOM DONT CUT IN LINE: QUEUE JUMP THIS IS THE ONLY CRIME THAT THE POPULATION WOULD CONSIDER BRINGING BACK CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR. DONT ASK HOW MUCH MONEY SOMEONE MAKES: INSTEAD PLAY A CURIOUS GUESSING GAME BY ASKING SOMEONE WHAT THEY DO, WHERE THEY LIVE, WHERE THEY WENT ON HOLIDAY, AND FIGURE IT OUT BY CORRELATING THIS WITH THEIR ACCENT. DONT INVITE SOMEONE TO YOUR HOME: UNLESS YOU KNOW THEM VERY VERY WELL. IRELAND DONT SAY TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU: I DONT KNOW HOW THIS PHRASE BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH IRISH PEOPLE, PERHAPS IT WAS USED IN THE DISTANT PAST. BUT ITS NOT NOW, AND ITS JUST REALLY IRRITATING. DONT ATTEMPT AN IRISH ACCENT: TO US THERE IS NO IRISH ACCENT; THERE ARE CORK ACCENTS, DUBLIN ACCENTS, KERRY ACCENTS ETC. FOR US AN ACCENT CONTAINS REAMS OF UNSPOKEN INFORMATION ABOUT A PERSON (URBAN/RURAL, SOCIAL STATUS) ASIDE FROM THE LOCATIONAL INFORMATION. DONT BE CHEAP: THE CLASSIC IS IN A ROUNDS SITUATION AT A PUB. IF SOMEONE IS OFFERING TO BUY THE FIRST ROUND, IT IS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO SAY OH IM ON A BUDGET, ILL GET MY OWN. IT IS NOT OK TO JOIN THE ROUND AND THEN NOT PAY FOR ONE. DONT CALL THE UK THE MAINLAND: AS FAR AS WERE CONCERNED, FRANCE IS THE MAINLAND.

FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST WE OPEN WITH A SHOT OF THE CHARACTER WERE MOST LIKELY TO REMEMBER FROM THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED ANGRY BIRDS SEVERAL YEARS AGO NAMELESS RED BIRD.  SO FAR, THIS IS A FILM ABOUT A CARTOON BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST ALSO PRESENT, THREE SEXY BIRDS. AT LEAST I ASSUME THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY. GOD, I HOPE THEY ARE, OTHERWISE IVE JUST PROJECTING A HORRIFIC AMOUNT OF SEXUAL AVAILABILITY ONTO THREE RELATIVELY GENDER-FREE CARTOON BIRDS. NOT THIS WEEK, HERITAGE. DONT DO THIS WHILE NEBULOUS ALMOST-BESTIALITY IS SUCH A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE. GET IT TOGETHER. FACEBOOK TWITTR PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, PHEW, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY AFTER ALL. AND THEY WERE AIMING ALL THEIR RED-HOT SEXUALITY AT THAT HUNKY SORT-OF BLUEISH BIRD. I HOPE THE RED BIRDS OK, AND DIDNT MISTAKENLY THINK THE OTHER BIRDS WERE ACTUALLY COMING ON TO HIM. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST AH.  ON TUESDAY, CASTRO READ FROM NOTES HELD IN HIS HAND AND GLANCED UP JERKILY FROM TIME TO TIME. HE DID. AND BY THE LOOK OF IT HE HASNT TAKEN THE REJECTION WELL.  THE GAP WAS ALSO VISIBLE IN JAPANESE OPTIONS MARKETS. IN FACT, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT HES NOW A FAIRLY ANGRY BIRD. SEE WHAT I DID THERE? THAT WAS CLEVER OF ME WASNT IT? SO ANGRY IS NAMELESS RED BIRD, IN FACT, THAT HE APPEARS TO HAVE ENROLLED IN SOME SORT OF ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME, ALONG WITH AN ANNOYING YELLOW BIRD PLAYED BY THE ANNOYING MAN WHO PLAYED THE ANNOYING SNOWMAN IN FROZEN.  AN INTERESTING BLIP, A BLIP TO MONITOR MOVING FORWARD, BUT YOU SHOULDNT GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF.

IF MY MEMORY IS CORRECT, THE BIRDS ALL DIE AS SOON AS THEYVE BEEN CATAPULTED AT THE PIGS, WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE WILLACTUALLY TURN UP TO BE A SORROWFUL MEDITATION ON THE FUTILITY OF WAR. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, WRONG AGAIN. ITS JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE IS LITERALLY JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME BIRDS WHO GET ANGRY SOMETIMES.

THEY'RE ONLY MONTHS OLD - INDIAN LAW ALLOWS THEM TO FILE PETITION! IN A FIRST OF ITS KIND PETITION IN JUDICIAL HISTORY, THE INFANTS - TWO SIX-MONTH-OLDS ARJUN GOPAL AND AARAV BHANDARI AND 14-MONTH-OLD ZOYA RAO BHASIN - MOVED THE SC THROUGH THEIR ADVOCATE FATHERS TO SEEK SEVERAL MEASURES TO MITIGATE POLLUTION AND EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO CLEAN AIR GUARANTEED UNDER ARTICLE 21 OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE SUPREME COURT RULES PERMIT MINORS TO FILE PETITIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THROUGH THEIR PARENTS AND GUARDIANS WHO TERM THEMSELVES AS 'NEXT FRIENDS'. THE IMMEDIATE PROVOCATION FOR THE FILING OF THE WRIT PETITION UNDER ARTICLE 32 OF THE CONSTITUTION WAS THE CRACKERS THAT WOULD GO UP IN A BURST OF SOUND, FLAME AND SMOKE DURING THE COMING FESTIVE SEASON. A SEASON OF SMOKE, IN THE WORLD'S MOST POLLUTED CITY THE PETITIONERS SOUGHT THE SC'S IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION "AGAINST INEVITABLE AND UPCOMING WIDESPREAD USE OF FIRECRACKERS AND FIREWORKS AND OTHER PRODUCTS OF THE SAME CLASSIFICATION, ESPECIALLY DURING DUSSEHRA AND DIWALI, BUT THEREAFTER IN ALL OTHER EVENTS AND FESTIVITIES AS WELL". THEY ALSO WANTED MEASURES TO CHECK POLLUTION HAZARDS LIKE BURNING CROP RESIDUES, POLLUTING VEHICLES AND OPEN WASTE DISPOSAL. THEY SAID, "OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, DELHI HAS RETAINED THE UNIQUE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE MOST POLLUTED CITY IN THE WORLD. THE LEVELS OF PARTICULATE MATTER ARE HIGHEST, AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, OVER 7 LAKH DEATHS OCCUR ANNUALLY DUE TO AIR-POLLUTION RELATED DISEASES. HOW POLLUTION IS CHOKING INDIA "STUDIES SHOW THAT INDIAN CITIZENS HAVE 30% LOWER LUNG CAPACITY THAN EUROPEANS, AND THAT CHILDREN ARE THE WORST AFFECTED, AS THEIR LUNGS HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED AND THEIR SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE. IN DELHI, A MAJORITY OF THE POLLUTION IS CAUSED BY OVER 500 MILLION TONNES OF CROP RESIDUE BURNT ANNUALLY IN NEIGHBOURING AREAS, BY POLLUTING TRUCKS THAT PASS THROUGH THE CITY DURING THE NIGHT, ROAD DUST AND POLLUTION FROM INDUSTRIES. "TO ADD TO THIS, THE SMOKE FROM BURSTING OF CRACKERS IN THE MONTHS OF OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER DURING THE FESTIVALS OF DUSSEHRA AND DIWALI VIRTUALLY CLOGS THE ATMOSPHERE, SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES THE POLLUTION LEVEL AND MAGNIFIES THE RISK OF CONTRACTING LUNG DISEASES." THEY SAID EVERY YEAR, THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF POLLUTION GETS DEBATED AND FORGOTTEN AS THE LETHARGIC GOVERNMENT MACHINERY DOES LITTLE TO PROTECT CITIZENS, ESPECIALLY INFANTS AND CHILDREN, FROM THE LONG-TERM TOXIC EFFECTS OF DEADLY POLLUTION ENVELOPING THE CAPITAL CITY. THE INFANTS ALSO SOUGHT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS FROM THE COURT TO THE GOVERNMENT ON A BAN ON BURNING POST-HARVEST CROP RESIDUE, STRINGENT ACTION AGAINST THOSE WHO DUMP DUST, MALBA (CONCRETE WASTE) AND OTHER POLLUTANTS AND INTRODUCING BHARAT-V EMISSION NORMS FOR VEHICLES.

675	REVISION. HE TRULY IS THE FASHION GENIUS HE THINKS HE IS KANYE WESTS SECOND COLLECTION FOR ADIDAS, WHICH DEBUTED AT THE NEW YORK FASHION WEEK 2015, WAS MET WIDELY WITH RIDICULE, BUT HE STILL THINKS HES A FASHION GENIUS. UNSURPRISINGLY, HIS WIFE KIM KARDASHIAN WEST IS OF THE SAME OPINION: HE IS A FASHION GENIUS BECAUSE HE IS THE ONE WHO TURNED HER INTO A FASHION ICON. THE LATEST VIDEO FROM CNN STYLE (SEE BELOW) FOCUSES ON KIMS RISE FROM DERIDED REALITY STAR TO THE STATUS OF CELEBRITY ALL DESIGNERS WANT TO PUT IN THE FIRST  ROW AT THEIR SHOWS.  KANYE CHANGED EVERYTHING SHORTLY AFTER KIM AND KANYE WENT PUBLIC WITH THEIR ROMANCE, HIS FIRST CAMEO ON KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS AIRED: IT SHOWED HIM GOING THROUGH HER WARDROBE AND TELLING HER THAT HE WOULD BE DRESSING HER FROM THEN ON.  THATS SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HORRIBLE SARTORIAL CHOICES SHE MADE THEN. TODAY, KIM KARDASHIAN IS WIDELY CONSIDERED A FASHION ICON, EVEN THOUGH MOST OF HER OUTFITS STILL PROVIDE CELEBRITY BLOGGERS WITH THE  BEST JOKE MATERIAL POSSIBLE. I REALLY THINK THAT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY HUSBAND KANYE REALLY CHANGED EVERYTHING, KIM SAYS. I MEAN, BACK IN THE DAY I THOUGHT I HAD THE BEST STYLE. I LOOK BACK AT OUTFITS AND I'M, LIKE, MORTIFIED.  JUST HELPING ME PUSH MY LIMITS A LITTLE BIT AND TRYING NEW THINGS. KANYE DID MANAGE TO TURN KIM INTO AN ICON KANYE IS ALSO THE FIRST TO STATE OUT LOUD THAT KIM WAS AN ICON, THE MARILYN MONROE OF OUR TIMES, THE MOST GORGEOUS, CLASSY AND STYLISH WOMAN IN THE WORLD. CLEARLY, SINCE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN HE LOVED, HE GETS A  PASS, BUT THE WORLD KNOWS THAT KIM IS NEITHER FASHIONABLE NOR STYLISH. SHE IS SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT: SHE IS POPULAR, AND IN TODAYS WORLD, POPULARITY MEANS EVERYTHING. EVEN THOUGH FASHION DESIGNERS WILL STILL MOCK HER (BUT ONLY AFTER THEY PUT HER IN THE FIRST ROW AT THEIR SHOWS), EVERYTHING SHE WEARS WILL STILL BECOME A TREND BECAUSE ITS ON HER AND SHE HAS MILLIONS OF ADORING FANS, DYING TO REPLICATE HER LOOK.
676	THE GARDINER EAST FOLLIES RETURNS FOR YET ANOTHER EXTENDED RUN AT CITY HALL BEGINNING ON TUESDAY MORNING, WHEN CITY OFFICIALS PRESENT THREE SCENARIOS FOR RELOCATING THE HIGHWAYS EASTERN END TO FREE UP VALUABLE WATERFRONT LAND. FOR MUCH OF THIS YEAR, AND SOME OF 2014, THE LIONS SHARE OF PUBLIC, POLICY AND POLITICAL ATTENTION HAS FOCUSED INTENSIVELY ON THE STRETCH BETWEEN CHERRY STREET AND THE DON RIVER . (FOR MORE ON THE ORIGINS OF THE PROBLEMATIC LOOP, READ THIS .) FIRST GULF, WHICH WANTS TO TRANSFORM THE SPRAWLING LEVER BROTHERS SITE INTO TORONTOS CANARY WHARF, HAS A STRONG INTEREST IN THE ALIGNMENT OF THE GARDINER/DVP INTERCHANGE, AS DO THE DEVELOPERS WHO OWN LAND ALONG THE KEATING CHANNEL. IN A SHOW LAST SPRING, SUBURBAN COUNCILLORS PUSHED TO KEEP THE HIGHWAY NETWORK IN TACT, WHILE DOWNTOWNERS FOUGHT TO REPLACE THAT ONE PORTION WITH AN AT-GRADE BOULEVARD. AFTER COUNCIL BACKED THE HYBRID OPTION, STAFF SPENT THE SUMMER CONSULTING WITH WATERFRONT ACTIVISTS, DEVELOPERS AND ENGINEERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PULL THE GARDINER NORTH TOWARDS THE RAILWAY YARD WHILE RE-CONCEPTUALIZING THE INTERCHANGE AS A SET OF RAMPS BETWEEN TWO HIGHWAYS INSTEAD OF A SINGLE CONTINUOUS ROUTE. THE ARM-WAVING ABOUT THE INTERCHANGE, HOWEVER, HAS MEANT THAT ALMOST NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT NASTY SEGMENT OF THE GARDINER THAT RUNS ASTRIDE LAKESHORE BLVD EAST, BETWEEN JARVIS AND CHERRY. INDEED, THE LATEST CITY STAFF REPORT NOTES THAT THE SECTION WEST OF CHERRY WILL LARGELY BE MAINTAINED. AND THEREIN LIES A MASSIVE MISSED OPPORTUNITY, ACCORDING TO ARCHITECT AND PLANNER CALVIN BROOK. HIS FIRM, BROOK MCILROY , HAS PITCHED CITY STAFF ON AN AMBITIOUS SCHEME TO STACK THAT STRETCH OF THE GARDINER ABOVE AN EXPANDED RAIL CORRIDOR AS A MEANS OF CREATING A KILOMETRE-LONG ELEVATED LINEAR PARK, 3.3 HECTARES OF NEW DEVELOPABLE CITY LAND AND A FRESH LEASE ON LIFE FOR LAKESHORE BLVD EAST. THE PLAN [ DOWNLOAD IT FROM DROPBOX ] WILL BE PRESENTED BRIEFLY DURING TOMORROWS COMMITTEE MEETING; CITY OFFICIALS ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED THAT THEYVE COMMISSIONED A COST-BENEFIT EVALUATION. BROOK MCILROYS CONSULTANTS, MEANWHILE, ESTIMATE THAT THE CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR THAT NEW GARDINER SEGMENT WILL BE $316 MILLION AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE OFFSET BY LAND SALES ON 4.3 MILLION SQ.-FT OF FREED-UP SPACE. BROOK, WHO HAS BEEN PONDERING HOW TO UNSTACK THE GARDINER AND THE LAKESHORE FOR MANY YEARS, EXPLAINED HIS PROPOSAL TO SPACING LAST WEEK. METROLINX, HE SAYS, PLANS TO EXPAND ITS GO SERVICE FROM 400 TRAINS PER DAY TO OVER 1,000 AS THE AGENCY MOVES TO AN ELECTRIFIED REGIONAL RAIL OFFERING OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS. THAT MEANS ADDING TRACKS THROUGH THE UNION STATION CORRIDOR, AND THEREFORE WIDENING THE RAILWAY BERM THAT HAS LONG BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE WATERFRONTS POOR ACCESSIBILITY. THE CITY OWNS A LONG FINGER OF LAND SOUTH OF THE TRACKS BETWEEN JARVIS AND CHERRY, AS WELL AS THE LAND BENEATH THE GARDINER AND THE LAKESHORE; THE THREE SLICES ARE ALMOST 70 METRES ACROSS IN SOME PLACES. IF THE CITY AND METROLINX CAN ALIGN THEIR CONSTRUCTION AGENDAS, BROOK SAYS, THEY COULD EXPAND THE EXISTING BERM SOUTH TO CREATE NOT ONLY ADDITIONAL TRACK SPACE, BUT A DECK ABOVE THE NEW TRACKS, UPON WHICH THE FOUR-LANE GARDINER COULD RUN. THE HIGHWAY PORTION, IN TURN, COULD ALSO BE DECKED, CREATING A LINEAR PARK OVERHEAD. THE PREMISE OF THIS IS VERY SIMPLE, HE STATES. ITS TO TAKE TWO INTERRUPTIONS IN THE FABRIC OF THE CITY AND TURN THEM INTO ONE. BROOKS POINTS TO SEVERAL COMPELLING ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF RE-BUILDING THE EASTERN GARDINER IN THIS WAY: STAGING : THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BERM, THE RAIL LINES, THE DECKING, THE HIGHWAY AND THE GREEN ROOF COULD ALL BE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT MAKING ANY ALTERATIONS TO THE EXISTING GARDINER. THAT TRANSLATES INTO NO CONSTRUCTION DELAYS AND ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO STAGING, WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DRIVE UP CAPITAL OUTLAYS. WHEN THE NEW GARDINER IS FINISHED, TRAFFIC CAN BE RE-ROUTED ONTO IT, AND THE DEMOLITION OF THE OLD ONE CAN COMMENCE. UNLOCKING CITY-OWNED LAND . BY STACKING THE GARDINER ON TOP OF THOSE NEW RAIL LINES, THE CITY FREES UP A STRETCH OF LAND THATS ABOUT 40 METRES DEEP AND ALMOST A KILOMETRE LONG MORE THAN ENOUGH SPACE, BROOK SAYS, TO DEVELOP POINT TOWERS, MID-RISE BUILDINGS AND OTHER STRUCTURES ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF LAKESHORE BLVD. EAST PUBLIC SPACE IMPROVEMENTS . WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT NOW POSSIBLE ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF LAKESHORE, THAT STREET GAINS A SECOND LEASE ON LIFE, AND CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO AN URBAN AVENUE RATHER THAN A SURFACE HIGHWAY. LIKEWISE, THE LINEAR PARK BUILT ABOVE THE DECKED GARDINER WILL SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF THOSE BUILDINGS DEVELOPED NORTH OF LAKESHORE, AS WELL AS OTHER WATERFRONT VISITORS AND INHABITANTS. IT ALSO PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE MID-BLOCK CONNECTIONS AND EVEN WIDER LAND BRIDGES ACROSS THE TRACKS THAT WOULD LINK THE EAST BAYFRONT COMMUNITY TO ST. LAWRENCE. BROOK POINTS OUT THAT THE LINEAR PARK WILL BE ROUGHLY AT THE SAME VERTICAL ELEVATION AS THE DECK OF THE CURRENT GARDINER, SO THIS EXTENDED STRUCTURE WONT SERVE AS YET ANOTHER VISUAL BARRIER. WHATS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT ITS VERY POROUS IN A NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION, HE SAYS, WITH EASY PEDESTRIAN/CYCLIST ACCESS BETWEEN LAKESHORE, THE LINEAR PARK AND GATEWAY POINTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CORRIDOR. HE ALSO OBSERVES THAT BROOKFIELD, THE CANADIAN COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT GIANT, HAS DEPLOYED NEW DECKING TECHNOLOGY AT ITS SPRAWLING HUDSON YARDS PROJECT IN MID-TOWN MANHATTAN, ALLOWING AN ACTIVE COMMUTER RAIL YARD TO CONTINUE FUNCTIONING WHILE A MASSIVE INTENSIFICATION PROJECT IS CONSTRUCTED DIRECTLY ABOVE IT. THE IDEA REQUIRES BOTH POLITICAL WILL, BUT ALSO A LEAP OF FAITH NOT BECAUSE IT IS TECHNICALLY COMPLEX OR FINANCIALLY OUTRAGEOUS, BUT RATHER DUE TO THE FACT THAT TORONTO, WITH ITS INCREMENTALIST POLITICAL CULTURE, HAS LONG TENDED TO SHUN BIG MOVES. YET THE RAILWAY BERM, CONSTRUCTED BACK IN THE 1920S TO MODERNIZE ACCESS TO AN INDUSTRIALIZING WATERFRONT, WAS A BIG MOVE, AS WAS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE GARDINER IN THE MID-1950S. BIG MOVES, ONE COULD ARGUE, MUST BE MET WITH OTHER BIG MOVES. AND THATS WHAT BROOK WILL BE PROPOSING TOMORROW. WITH THE GARDINER EAST EA DUE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE PROVINCE BY NEXT SPRING, MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL POLITICIANS SHOULD LISTEN TO BROOK BECAUSE HIS IDEA IS NOT ONLY PLAUSIBLE; IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE TRANSFORMATIONAL IN A HIGHLY CHALLENGED GEOGRAPHY THAT REQUIRES US, FINALLY, TO MAKE NO (MORE) LITTLE PLANS .

677	IN THE READING ROOM AT THE UCL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION, NEWSAM LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES OVER THE LAST YEAR, I HAVE BEEN PART OF THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES TRANSFORMING ARCHIVES TRAINEESHIP AT THE UCL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION. THE FOCUS OF MY TRAINEESHIP HAS BEEN DIGITISATION AND DIGITAL PRESERVATION. BEYOND THIS, I HAVE ALSO ENGAGED IN WIDE VARIETY OF JOBS WITHIN THE TEAM, INCLUDING SEVERAL CATALOGUING PROJECTS, READING ROOM SUPERVISION, WORKING WITH VOLUNTEERS, ASSISTING IN TEACHING SESSIONS AND HELPING TO ORGANISE AND APPRAISE NEW COLLECTIONS. THIS HAS BEEN A WELL-ROUNDED AND CHALLENGING YEAR. I HAVE GAINED A REAL APPRECIATION AND UNDERSTANDING FOR THE ROLE OF THE ARCHIVIST AND FEEL WELL PREPARED FOR EMBARKING ON THE NEXT STAGE OF MY CAREER. BEFORE STARTING THE TRAINEESHIP, I WORKED IN A VARIETY OF CONTEXTS, FROM TRAINING AS A PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTER TO RUNNING A RECORD LABEL, BEFORE I ENDED UP WORKING IN LIBRARIES. I REALLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT AN ARCHIVIST DID, BUT WHEN I DISCOVERED IT AS A POTENTIAL CAREER I FELT IT WAS A PERFECT COMBINATIONOF MY INTEREST IN THE STUDY OF HISTORY AND MY LIFELONG FASCINATION WITH COLLECTIONS AND COLLECTING. FROM THIS POINT ON I WAS KEEN TO LEARN MORE AND MORE ABOUT ARCHIVES. PRIOR TO THIS ROLE, I VOLUNTEERED AT THE AHMED IQBAL ULLAH RACE RELATIONS ARCHIVE AND ARCHIVES+, BOTH IN MANCHESTER. ONE OF THE GREAT EXPERIENCES OF THIS TRAINEESHIP HAS BEEN ENGAGING WITH THE ARCHIVE MATERIALS. THE COLLECTIONS AT THE INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION HAVE OPENED UP A WHOLE AREA OF HISTORY OF WHICH I WAS PREVIOUSLY UNAWARE. WITH THE MAJORITY OF COLLECTIONS DOCUMENTING EDUCATION IN THE 20THCENTURY, THEY TELL VARIOUS STORIES ABOUT EDUCATION POLICY AND PHILOSOPHY. FROM THE IDEALISM OF OPEN AIR SCHOOLING TO THE RADICALISM OF ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE SOCIALIST TEACHERS ALLIANCE, THESE COLLECTIONS SHOW HOW EDUCATION IS A HIGHLY CONTESTED SUBJECT WHICH CAN TELL US A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT DISCUSSIONS ABOUT CHILDRENS FUTURES WERE RENDERED THROUGH MORE SUBTLE FORMS, SUCH AS HANDWRITING AND ARCHITECTURE, WHICH WERE MEANS OF CREATING ATTITUDINAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES TO HOW CHILDREN LEARNED. IT HAS BEEN A REAL PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH THIS MATERIAL ON A DAILY BASIS (I STILL CANT QUITE BELIEVE THIS IS AN ACTUAL REAL JOB THAT YOU GET PAID FOR!) AND I WILL BE MOVING ON FROM THIS ROLE CONVINCED THAT UNDERSTANDING, LOOKING AFTER AND SHARING THESE STORIES PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN OUR SOCIETY. OPEN AIR SCHOOLING AT THE GARDEN SCHOOL, 1920S (INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION, CATALOGUE REFERENCE: WF/4/249) AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS TRAINEESHIP HAS BEEN DIGITISATION AND DIGITAL PRESERVATION. THIS HAS INVOLVED A VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE AS IT WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY NEW TO ME. THE MAJORITY OF MY WORK HAS BEEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROJECT DIGITISING AN ACADEMIC JOURNAL CALLED THE EDUCATIONAL TIMES. THIS WAS PRODUCED BY AN ORGANISATION CALLED THE COLLEGE OF PRECEPTORS, ESTABLISHED IN THE MID 19TH CENTURY, WHO WERE SEEKING TO PROFESSIONALISE TEACHING BY CREATING PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND QUALIFICATIONS. THE JOURNAL SITS WITHIN A MUCH LARGER COLLECTION DOCUMENTING THIS ORGANISATION, BUT PROVIDES THE MOST CONCISE DISTILLATION OF THE ORGANISATIONS AIMS AND ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS OFFERING INSIGHT INTO THE ATTITUDES OF TEACHERS IN THIS PERIOD. THE EDUCATIONAL TIMES, VOL. 1 NO. 1, 1847 (INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION, CATALOGUE REFERENCE: COP/K/1/1) WE CHOSE THIS JOURNAL FOR TWO REASONS. FIRSTLY, BECAUSE OF ITS FRAGILITY. DUE TO ITS AGE AND THE LOW QUALITY PAPER USED, MANY PAGES ARE STARTING TO FLAKE AND THE BINDING IS STARTING TO LOOSEN. DIGITISING THE MATERIAL WILL AID THE PRESERVATION OF THESE RARE ORIGINAL COPIES BY ALLOWING USERS TO VIEW THEM PRIMARILY IN ELECTRONIC FORM. THE SECOND REASON FOR CHOOSING THIS PARTICULAR JOURNAL IS THAT WE RECEIVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF ENQUIRIES ABOUT IT. THE JOURNAL REGULARLY PUBLISHED LISTS OF RECENTLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS, WHICH ARE OF INTEREST TO BOTH ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS AND GENEALOGISTS BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC TEACHERS, WHEN THEY QUALIFIED AND WHICH SCHOOL THEY TAUGHT IN. MAKING THESE VOLUMES AVAILABLE AND FULLY SEARCHABLE ONLINE HAS ALREADY PROVED TO BE AN ASSET FOR OUR RESEARCHERS, AND HAS RESCUED THE ARCHIVISTS FROM THE OFTEN DAUNTING TASK OF TRAWLING THROUGH SEVERAL VOLUMES LOOKING FOR THAT ONE ELUSIVE NAME! I HAVE PLANNED AND MANAGED THIS PROJECT FROM THE BEGINNING, WHICH HAS REALLY BEEN IN MASTERCLASS IN DIGITISATION AND DIGITAL PRESERVATION SKILLS. FROM EARLY SCOPING AND PLANNING EXERCISES, TO CONDITION SURVEYS, TO GRAPPLING WITH FILE FORMATS AND METADATA, TO MANAGING A TEAM OF VOLUNTEERS, TO PROMOTION VIA SOCIAL MEDIA, I HAVE A ACQUIRED A VARIETY OF SKILLS WHICH I HOPE TO DEVELOP FURTHER. I WAS ALSO FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE FUNDING FROMJISC TO DEVELOP THE PROJECT FURTHER WITH COLLEAGUES FROM UCL. THIS HAS INVOLVED DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH ACADEMICS TO PROMOTE THE RESOURCE, USING SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION TECHNIQUES AND CREATING A PODCAST TO PROMOTE THE COLLECTION. THIS TRAINEESHIP HAS BEEN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN AND DEVELOP THESE SKILLS WHILE WORKING ALONGSIDE ARCHIVISTS. I HAVE GAINED A REAL APPRECIATION OF THE JOB AND TAKE WITH ME AN ENTHUSIASM AND PASSION TO THE NEXT STAGE OF MY CAREER.
678	12:02 10, 2015 THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR HAS STARTED. STUDENTS ARRIVED FOR THE FIRST DAY WITH PLENTY OF PENS, PENCILS, PAPER, NOTEBOOKS AND A MYRIAD OF OTHER SUPPLIES NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT THEY MAY BE MISSING ANOTHER IMPORTANT SCHOOL SUPPLY A LIBRARY CARD. SEPTEMBER IS NATIONAL LIBRARY CARD SIGN-UP MONTH, A TIME WHEN THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND LIBRARIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY REMIND PARENTS THAT A LIBRARY CARD IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SCHOOL SUPPLY OF ALL. THE MONTH-LONG OBSERVANCE WAS LAUNCHED IN 1987 TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THEN SECRETARY OF EDUCATION WILLIAM J. BENNETT WHO BELIEVED EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE A LIBRARY CARD AND BE ABLE TO USE IT. SINCE THEN, PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE JOINED IN THE NATIONAL EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. ACCORDING TO THE ALA, LIBRARIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN. STUDIES SHOW THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE READ TO IN THE HOME AND WHO USE THE LIBRARY PERFORM BETTER IN SCHOOL AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO USE THE LIBRARY AS A SOURCE OF LIFETIME LEARNING. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL PART OF HAVING AN EDUCATED AND LITERATE POPULATION. IN ADDITION TO PRINT BOOKS AND PERIODICALS, MOST PUBLIC LIBRARIES TODAY HAVE A WIDE ARRAY OF OTHER MEDIA INCLUDING AUDIO BOOKS, E-BOOKS, CDS, CASSETTES, VIDEOTAPES, DVDS AND VIDEO GAMES, AS WELL AS FACILITIES TO ACCESS THE INTERNET AND INTER-LIBRARY BORROWING OF ITEMS FROM OTHER LIBRARIES. LIBRARIES PROVIDE OTHER SERVICES, SUCH AS COMMUNITY MEETING ROOMS, STORYTELLING SESSIONS FOR INFANTS, TODDLERS, PRESCHOOL CHILDREN OR AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS. THEY HAVE ONLINE PROGRAMS FOR HOMEWORK HELP AND FOR PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND THE ALWAYS POPULAR SUMMER READING PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN, TEENS AND ADULTS. A LIBRARY CARD IS THE KEY TO A WORLD OF INFORMATION. THE FIRST STEP IN ACCESSING THAT INFORMATION IS BY GETTING A LIBRARY CARD. ITS EASY AND ITS FREE. THERE ARE NO HIDDEN CHARGES, NO PAYMENT DUE EVERY MONTH FOR THE RESOURCES IT PROVIDES STUDENTS TO COMPETE ACADEMICALLY. A LIBRARY CARD IS THE SMARTEST CARD YOU CAN HAVE AND ONE OF THE BEST TOOLS FOR SCHOOL.

680	ON FRIDAY 4TH, MS CECILIA NAHN, ARGENTINA AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES, WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR THE HUFFINGTON POST, TITLED 'MALVINAS: ALL ARGENTINA IS SAYING IS GIVE DIALOGUE A CHANCE.' IN THE ARTICLE, AMBASSADOR NAHN DESCRIBED HOW OLD POLITICAL DISPUTES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE BEING SOLVED AS A RESULT OF 'A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE AND DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS.' AMB. NAHN WENT ON TO DETAIL HOW THE QUESTION OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS WAS AN '182-YEAR OLD SOVEREIGNTY DISPUTE WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM', IN REFERENCE TO THE REASSERTION OF BRITISH SOVEREIGNTY OF THE ISLANDS IN 1833. ARGENTINA REFERS TO THIS AS THE 'USURPATION' OF THE ISLANDS, AND CLAIMS THAT THE ENTIRE ARGENTINA POPULATION WAS FORCIBLY EJECTED FROM THE ISLANDS, ALTHOUGH RECORDS WITHIN THE ARGENTINE NATIONAL ARCHIVES SHOW THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA STATES REGULARLY THAT ITS CLAIM TO THE FALKLAND ISLANDS RUNS CONTINUOUSLY FROM THE 1820S. IT DOES NOT. THE ARGENTINE CLAIM TO SPANISH SUCCESSION, WHICH WAS NEVER ACCEPTED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM, WAS ENDED BY THE 'CONVENTION OF PEACE', RATIFIED IN 1850, AND FOR 34 YEARS ARGENTINA WAS SILENT OVER THE FALKLANDS, DURING WHICH TIME SEVERAL ARGENTINE LEADERS STATED THAT ARGENTINA HAD NO DISPUTE WITH BRITAIN. THERE WAS A BRIEF FLURRY OF LETTERS IN THE 1880S BUT AFTER THAT, THE 'CLAIM' TO THE ISLANDS WAS DROPPED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA UNTIL THE 1930S. JOS MARA RUDA REIGNITED THE DISCUSSION OVER THE SO-CALLED 'CLAIM' TO THE ISLANDS IN 1965 WITH HIS IMPASSIONED (AND INACCURATE) SPEECH TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE III. THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT HAS PREVIOUSLY WORKED ALONGSIDE THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA, WITH JOINT ACCORDS ON A RANGE OF ECONOMIC ISSUES. ONE BY ONE, AND LARGELY UNDER A KIRCHNER REGIME, THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA HAS RENEGED ON THESE AGREEMENTS. IN THE DECADE OF KIRCHNERITE GOVERNMENT, ARGENTINA HAS WALKED AWAY FROM EVERY CHANCE OF DIALOGUE ON THE FALKLANDS. AMB. NAHN ACCUSES BRITAIN OF 'MILITARIZATION' OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC, BUT THE MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE ISLANDS IS A LEVEL APPROPRIATE TO DETER AGGRESSION BY ARGENTINA, AND IS PROPORTIONATE TO THE PERCEIVED THREAT.  BUT FOR TORCH, IT'S A WAY OF LIFE. THE GVERNMENT OF ARGENTINE, WHILST DENYING ANY MILITARY DESIGNS ON THE ISLANDS, HAS SPENT THE PAST YEAR ATTEMPTING TO BROKER DEALS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT FROM SPAIN, SWEDEN, ISRAEL, RUSSIA AND CHINA TO BOLSTER ITS OWN FORCES, YET BITTERLY COMPLAINS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES (INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW SCHOOL) IN THE FALKLANDS. THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF ALL PEOPLES IN ENSHRINED IN THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER, AND SAFEGUARDS THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO DETERMINE ONE'S OWN POLITICAL FUTURE, AND ANY ALLEGIANCES THEREIN. WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, HAVE A RIGHT TO A SAY IN OUR OWN POLITICAL FUTURE, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS ASSURED US THAT THERE CAN BE NO DISCUSSIONS ON SOVEREIGNTY WITH ARGENTINA UNLESS WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, SO WISH. AND WE EXPRESSED OUR WISH IN OUR HISTORIC REFERENDUM IN MARCH 2013. THIS WAS INTERNATIONALLY OVERSEEN AND SAW 99.8% OF THOSE WHO VOTED FREELY CHOOSING TO RETAIN OUR CURRENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UK. AMB.  BUT IT IS UNTRUE. THE UK HAS SIMPLY SAID THAT ISLANDERS NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY DISCUSSIONS, AND WE HAVE EXTENDED NUMEROUS INVITATIONS TO TALK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA. THESE GO UNACKNOWLEDGED. IN FEBRUARY 2013 THEN- BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY AGUE AGREED TO MEET WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF ARGENTINA IN LONDON. TIMERMAN REFUSED TO ATTEND BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE AND I, AS ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT, WERE PRESENT. THE EMPTY CHAIR AT THAT MEETING SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT THE SINCERITY OF ARGENTINA'S CALL FOR DIALOGUE. AMB. NAHN CLAIMS TO SEEK DIALOGUE WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM TO 'NEGOTIATE' OVER THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, YET THE ARGENTINE CONSTITUTION (REVISED IN 1994) PLAINLY STATES 'THE RECOVERY OF SAID TERRITORIES [FALKLAND ISLANDS, SOUTH GEORGIA & SOUTH SANDWICH ISLANDS] AND THE FULL EXERCISE OF SOVEREIGNTY [...] CONSTITUTES A PERMANENT AND UNRELINQUISHABLE GOAL OF THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE.' CONSTITUTIONALLY, THEN, ARGENTINA CANNOT, AND WILL NOT, SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN FULL CONTROL OF THE FALKLANDS, AND THEREFORE ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ISLANDS ISN'T A 'NEGOTIATION' AT ALL - WHEN ARGENTINA SAYS 'DIALOGUE' IT REALLY MEANS 'DELIVER THE FALKLANDS TO US.' THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH ARGENTINA ABOUT MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST, YET IT IS ARGENTINA WHO CONSISTENTLY IGNORES OUR INVITATIONS WHILST CRYING OUT FOR CONVERSATION. ARGENTINA'S DISINGENUOUS CALL FOR DIALOGUE IS IN REALITY A CALL TO COLONISE OUR COUNTRY, SEIZE OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND DENY OUR RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION. -- THIS FEED AND ITS CONTENTS ARE THE PROPERTY OF THE HUFFINGTON POST, AND USE IS SUBJECT TO OUR TERMS.

681	METRO DETECTIVES TRAVELED TO MCMINNVILLE MONDAY AFTERNOON TO CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATION INTO CLARKS MURDER. EARLIER THIS MONTH, POLICE SAID CLARK SWORE OUT A MISDEMEANOR DMOMESTIC ASSAULT WARRANT AGAINST COPELAND, SAYING HE PUNCHED HER DIN THE BACK OF HER HEAD AND FACE AFTER SHE DECLINED TO GIVE HIM A RIDE HOME FROM HER APARTMENT. COPELAND FLED BEFORE POLICE ARRIVED. AT THE TIME, POLICE SAID CLARK DECLINED OFFICERS OFFERS TO ARRANGE FOR COUNSELING, SHELTER AND AN ORDER OF PROTECTION. THE DOMESTIC ASSAULT ARREST WARRANT ON COPELAND WAS STILL OUTSTANDING AT THE TIME OF CLARKS MURDER, DESPITE OFFICERS ATTEMPTS TO SERVE IT ON SEPT. 7. POLICE SAID CLARKS RELATIONSHIP WITH COPELAND APPARENTLY CONTINUED, WITH COPELAND REPORTEDLY PICKING UP ONE OF CLARKS CHILDREN FROM A CAREGIVER ON FRIDAY.  COPELAND WAS CONVICTED OF SECOND-DEGREE MUDER IN 1993 AND RECIVED A 25-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. HE WAS ALSO CONVICTED OF OBBERY THAT SAME YEAR AND RECEIVED A 6-YEAR SENTENCE. METRO POLICE ARRESTED HIM IN 2007 FOR PAROLE VIOLATION. COPELAND REGISTERED WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS AN EX-CONVICT IN 2012. HE WAS ARRESTED THE FOLLOWING YEAR FOR MISDEMEANOR DMESTIC ASSAULT AGAINST HIS GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME. THAT CASE WAS RETIRED IN GENERAL SESSIONS COURT IN NOVEMBER 2013. INVESTIGATORS SAID THEY WILL BE SEEXKING A CRIMINAL HOMICIDE WARRANT AGAINST COPELAND IN CONNECTION WITH CLARKS MURDER. OUTSIDE CLARK'S APARTMENT TUESDAY WERE FADED CHALK DRAWINGS OF A TURTLE, A SUN, A SPIDER IN A WEB AND A GAME OF HOPSCOTCH. NEIGHBORS SAID THEY WOULD OFTEN STEP OUT, LOOK DOWN THE HALL AND FIND CLARK DRAWING WITH HER THREE CHILDREN. THEY SAID A LITTLE NOTE WRITTEN ON A WALL COULDNB'T BE MORE TRUE, "LOVE WAS HERE." "THE DANGER IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIPS IS REAL," SAID TRACY DETOMASI OF YWCA NASHVILLE. "A LOT OF TIMES, BECAUSE YOU LOVE THE PERSON AND YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH THEM, YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THEY CAN CHANGE. THEY WON'T DO THATAGAIN. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE." "WE HAVE A CRISIS HOTLINE THAT'S 24 HOURS A DAY THAT THEY CAN CALL," DETOMASI CONTINUED. "THEY CAN CALL TO TALK. THEY CAN CALL TO GET A SAFETY PLAN. THEY CAN CALL TO GET INTO OUR SHELTER THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL. THE LOCATION IS CONFIDENTIAL.  THE APPLE TV BOX ITSELF IS A HALF-INCH TALLER AND 50 PERCWENT HEAVIER THAN IT'S PREDECESSOR, MOSTLY DUE TO A LARGER POWER SUPPLY AND HEATINK. WE HAVE 51 BEDS, AND IT ISTHE LARGEST IN TENNESSEE." YWCA OFFICIALS SAID WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS OUTREACH, LETTING OTHERS KNOW HELP IS AVAILABLE. "IT'S BEING AWARE OF WHAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS, WHY WOMEN DON'T LEAVE," SAID DETOMASI.

THE LETTER URGED KEJRIWAL TO ISSUE DIRECTIONS TO THE POLICE TO REFRAIN FROM REFERRING TO BHARTI AS AN ABSCONDER.
683	IS YOUR DOCTOR KEEPING A SECRET FROM YOU? IF YOU DONT KNOW YOUR BREAST DENSITY, YOU DONT HAVE ALL KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR BREAST HEALTH, SAID NANCY CAPPELLO, A FORMER EDUCATION ADMINISTRATOR FROM WOODBURY, CONNECTICUT, WHO STARTED THE ARE YOU DENSE CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE OTHER WOMEN. CAPPELLO CALLS BREAST DENSITY A BEST-KEPT SECRET. IF YOU HAVE A MAMMOGRAM, YOUR DOCTOR KNOWS YOUR BREAST BUT IS HE SHARING THIS CRITICAL INFORMATION WITH YOU? DEPENDING ON WHICH LIVE IN, THE ANSWER COULD BE NO. NANCYS STORY CAPPELLOS STORY IS SHOCKING. AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF ROUTINE ANNUAL MAMMOGRAMS AND THE HAPPY GRAM REPORTS THAT SHOWED HER RESULTS AS NORMAL WITH NO SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS, CAPPELLO WAS TOLD SHE HAD CANCER WHEN A DOCTOR NOTICED A SUSPICIOUS RIDGE IN HER RIGHT BREAST DURING AN ANNUAL PHYSICAL EXAM. A SUBSEQUENT MAMMOGRAM REVEALED NOTHING, BUT ULTRASOUND SHOWED STAGE 3C CANCER THAT HAD SPREAD TO 13 LYMPH NODES. FROM THE SIZE AND HOW IT METASTASIZED, THE CANCER HAD BEEN GROWING FOR SIX YEARS, CAPPELLO SAID. AS A HEALTHY WOMAN AND EDUCATED PATIENT WHO WATCHED HER WEIGHT, EXERCISED REGULARLY AND NEVER MISSED A MAMMOGRAM APPOINTMENT, CAPPELLO WAS BOWLED OVER TO LEARN SHE HAD ADVANCED BREAST CANCER. THATS WHEN HER DOCTOR TOLD HER ABOUT HER DENSE BREAST TISSUE AND HOW IT CAN HIDE CANCER ON A MAMMOGRAM. I ASKED, WHY WASNT I TOLD I HAVE DENSE BREAST TISSUE? THE RESPONSE WAS THAT ITS NOT STANDARD PROTOCOL TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH THE PATIENT, CAPPELLO SAID. SHE WENT INTO ACTION, AND CONNECTICUT WAS THE FIRST STATE TO PASS A BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAW. WHAT DOES DENSE MEAN? DENSE BREAST TISSUE IS NOT ABNORMAL. ITS JUST THE A WOMAN IS BUILT, SAID DR. KATHRYN EVERS, DIRECTOR OF BREAST IMAGING AT FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER IN PHILADELPHIA. ABOUT 57 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS DENSE BREAST TISSUE, WHICH MEANS THAT IT HAS A HIGH PROPORTION OF GLANDULAR OR CONNECTIVE TISSUE. A RADIOLOGIST READS A MAMMOGRAM AND RATES IT IN FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FROM EXTREMELY FATTY TO EXTREMELY DENSE, SAID DR. EMILY F. CONANT, PROFESSOR AND CHIEF, DIVISION OF BREAST IMAGING, DEPARTMENT OF RADIOLOGY, HOSPITAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. TEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE HAVE ENTIRELY FATTY BREAST TISSUE AND 10 PERCENT HAVE EXTREMELY DENSE BREAST TISSUE. THE OTHER 80 PERCENT THE POPULATION IS BROKEN DOWN EVENLY BETWEEN SCATTERED FIBROGLANDULAR (FATTY) TISSUE AND HETEROGENEOUSLY DENSE.  "I THINK THE KEY FOCUS NOW IS ACTUALLY ON IMPLEMENTATION, AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT ALL PARTIES HAVE SIGNED, I BELIEVE THERE IS A KEEN COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF ALL SOUTH SUDANESE PARTIES TO SEE A GENUINE PEACE ACHIEVED," KENYATTA SAID. DENSE BREAST TISSUE CAMOUFLAGES TUMORS ON A MAMMOGRAM, EVERS SAID. FATTY TISSUE SHOWS UP GREYISH BLACK ON A MAMMOGRAM, MAKING IT STAND OUT. DENSE TISSUE LOOKS WHITE. BREAST MASSES OR TUMORS ALSO APPEAR WHITE ON A MAMMOGRAM, MAKING THEM HARD OR IMPOSSIBLE TO SPOT IN DENSE BREASTS. PAGE 2 OF 3 - BREAST DENSITY VARIES BY AGE AND WEIGHT, CONANT SAID. AS WOMEN AGE THEIR BREASTS BECOME LESS DENSE. WOMEN WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE OFTEN HAVE DENSER BREASTS. NOT ONLY CAN DENSE BREAST TISSUE HIDE CANCER ON A MAMMOGRAM, THERE IS SOME INCREASED RISK FOR BREAST CANCER FOR WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS, EVERS SAID. ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO TELL IF YOUR BREASTS ARE DENSE BY SIGHT OR FEEL. ITS NOT A MATTER OF A BREAST FEELING FIRM OR LUMPY, EVERS SAID. BREAST DENSITY CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY A MAMMOGRAM, SHE SAID. INFORMATION VS. EXPENSE AND THATS WHERE A OF COMES IN, CONANT SAID. TWENTY-FOUR STATES HAVE LAWS THAT REQUIRE HEALTH FACILITIES TO NOTIFY WOMEN IF THEY HAVE DENSE BREASTS. ELEVEN OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAWS, AND NATIONWIDE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS. A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW AND DESERVES TO BE EDUCATED SO SHE CAN MAKE INFORMED HEALTH-CARE CHOICES AND POSSIBLY SEEK ADDITIONAL SCREENING METHODS, CAPPELLO SAID.  "I AM EXCITED TO JOIN THE NIKA LEADERSHIP TEAM AND TO BE CHARGED WITH DEFINING OUR CORPORATE STRATEGIES AS WE SEEK TO DELIVER RESULTS FOR A BROADER SET OF CUSTOMERS." BEFORE JOINING NIKA, DENMAN SERVED AS THE DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY OPERATIONS AND SENIOR NAVAL ADVISOR AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT. THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT, THOUGH, IS WARY OF CREATING PANIC AND ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO SEEK OUT COSTLY ADDITIONAL SCREENING TESTS, CONANT SAID. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW THEIR BREAST CONANT SAYS. BUT TELLING WOMEN CAUSES FRUSTRATION BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THERE ARE RISKS AND BENEFITS TO MAMMOGRAMS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE NEGATIVES. FOR A WOMAN WITH DENSE BREASTS, AN ULTRASOUND IS A COMPLEMENTARY SCREENING, CONANT SAID: USED WITH MAMMOGRAMS, ULTRASOUNDS MAY MORE EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING BREAST CANCER BUT THEY COME WITH MANY FALSE NEGATIVES AND POSITIVES. AN MRI IS A VERY GOOD TOOL. IT FINDS MORE CANCERS THAN A MAMMOGRAM AND HAS SLIGHTLY FEWER FALSE POSITIVES THAN A MAMMOGRAM, CONANT SAID. BUT MRIS CAN COST THOUSANDS, AND INSURANCE WONT COVER IT IN THE CASE OF A WOMAN WHO HAS DENSE BREASTS AND NO OTHER HIGH-RISK FACTORS. THREE-DIMENSIONAL MAMMOGRAMS ARE THE BEST SCREENING METHOD FOR BREAST CANCER, CONANT SAID. ITS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE HAVING. THE BENEFITS OF 3-D MAMMOGRAMS INCLUDE THE ABILITY FOR THE RADIOLOGIST TO ZOOM IN, MAGNIFY AND CHANGE THE CONTRAST OF THE BREAST IMAGE AND VIEW IT IN SLICES FOR MORE PRECISE IMAGES, FLEXIBLE FOR GREATER COMFORT AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FALSE POSITIVES. ADVICE THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY RECOMMENDS WOMEN GET AN ANNUAL MAMMOGRAM STARTING AT AGE 40, CONTINUING AS LONG AS A WOMANS IN GOOD HEALTH. AS A WOMAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOUR DOCTOR, CAPPELLO SAID. THE INFORMATION SHOULD NEVER BE HIDDEN.

685	DR. HUXTABLE TO THE ER, STAT! WE'VE GOT A CLASSIC CASE OF BLOCKED POLICIES ON OUR HANDS! BY NOW, MANY OF US ASSUMED THAT THE DISTURBING SEXUAL ABUSE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST COMEDIAN BILL COSBY -- WHO PLAYED DR. HEATHCLIFF "CLIFF" HUXTABLE ON TV'S LONG-RUNNING SITCOM, "THE COSBY SHOW" -- WOULD EVENTUALLY BE PLAYED OUT IN A COURT OF LAW. WE DIDN'T EXPECT THIS SCANDAL TO TAKE A DETOUR THROUGH INSURANCE COURT, MUCH LESS INVOLVE A HOME INSURANCE POLICY. COSBY WANTS AIG'S SUIT TOSSED OR DELAYED LAST WEEK, THE 78-YEAR-OLD ACTOR, WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY AT LEAST 40 WOMEN OF HAVING DRUGGED AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THEM OVER SEVERAL DECADES, ASKED A FEDERAL JUDGE IN SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, TO DISMISS OR PUT ON HOLD A LAWSUIT FILED BY HIS HOME INSURER, AIG. IN JUNE, AIG SUED COSBY IN CALIFORNIA AND MASSACHUSETTS OVER HOME INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED TO HIM IN THOSE STATES. THE INSURER MAINTAINS THE POLICIES IN QUESTION COVER PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, WHICH INCLUDE DEFAMATION, EXCEPT WHEN THOSE CLAIMS ARISE FROM "SEXUAL, PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ABUSE." DEFAMATION LAWSUITS HAVE ALREADY BEEN FILED AGAINST COSBY BY TAMARA GREEN, THERESE SERIGNESE AND LINDA TRAITZ IN MASSACHUSETTS, AND BY MODEL JANICE DICKINSON IN CALIFORNIA. THE WOMEN CLAIM THEY WERE DEFAMED BY THE DENIALS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY COSBY OR HIS REPRESENTATIVES. RISK OF 'SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE' SEEN COSBY'S COUNSEL MAINTAINS THE ACTOR WOULD FACE "SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE" IF HE WERE TO HAVE TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THE WOMEN'S LAWSUITS AND AIG'S POLICY ACTION SIMULTANEOUSLY. "FORCING MR. COSBY TO FIGHT A FOUR-FRONT BATTLE WOULD DEMONSTRATE AIG'S COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF MR. COSBY," HIS LAWYERS WROTE IN A COURT FILING. "NOT ONLY DOES AIG'S ACTION BOLSTER THE UNDERLYING PLAINTIFFS, WHO WILL PERCEIVE MR. COSBY AS UNDER ATTACK EVEN FROM HIS SUPPOSED BACKERS, BUT IT SPLITS MR. COSBY'S FOCUS AND DRAINS HIS RESOURCES." AN AIG SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT, WHEN ASKED BY REUTERS. THE INSURANCE COMPANY NAMED THE 4 WOMEN AS CODEFENDANTS IN ITS ACTION, STATING THAT IT WAS SEEKING RELIEF THAT COULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THEIR DEFAMATION SUITS. THOUGH FEW OF US TAKE NOTE OF IT, DEFAMATION AND LIABILITY RISK IS GROWING WITH THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, TO THE POINT WHERE SOME INSURERS ADVOCATE SPECIAL COVERAGE FOR BLOGGERS .

686	(NAPSI)WHILE THE COLD AND FLU SEASON OFTEN COINCIDES WITH HOLIDAY CELEBRATIONS AND FAMILY GET-TOGETHERS, THERE ARE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES THAT FAMILIES CAN TAKE TO STAY HEALTHY AND NOT MISS OUT. TO HELP YOU GET TO THE NEXT CANT MISS LIFE EVENT, CONSIDER THESE TOP PREVENTATIVE TIPS: GET AN ANNUAL FLU SHOT. ITS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFLUENZA. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE, YOU CAN GET A VACCINE AT ANY OF THE MORE THAN 7,800 CVS/PHARMACY AND 900 MINUTECLINIC LOCATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE FLU SHOT IS AVAILABLE EVERY DAY WITH NO APPOINTMENT NEEDED, INCLUDING EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS. AS A PREVENTIVE SERVICE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, ITS FULLY COVERED AND AVAILABLE AT NO COST THROUGH MOST INSURANCE PLANS, INCLUDING MEDICARE PART B. THE PHARMACY CAN ALSO BE A ONE-STOP SHOP FOR FLU PREVENTION RESOURCES, INCLUDING OVER-THE-COUNTER COLD AND FLU REMEDIES, MULTIVITAMINS AND ANTI-BACTERIAL CLEANING PRODUCTS. PLUS, ANYONE ENROLLED IN THE EXTRACARE REWARDS PROGRAM GETS A 20 PERCENT OFF CVS SHOPPING PASS UPON GETTING THE FLU SHOT IN MOST PLACES. SENIORS, TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTION. THERES A HIGH-DOSE FLU SHOT DESIGNED FOR THOSE 65 AND OLDER, WHO HAVE A GREATER RISK OF SEVERE ILLNESS FROM THE FLU. PLAN AHEAD: THE EARLIER, THE BETTER. IT TAKES UP TO TWO WEEKS FOR YOUR IMMUNITY TO BUILD UP AFTER GETTING A FLU SHOT. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) RECOMMENDS THAT EVERYONE WHO IS AT LEAST 6 MONTHS OLD GET A FLU SHOT AS SOON AS THE VACCINE IS AVAILABLE. STAY HOME IF YOURE ILL. WHILE IT MAY SEEM LIKE A NO-BRAINER, TWO-THIRDS OF EMPLOYED AMERICANS WOULD STILL GO TO WORK EVEN IF THEY WERE FEELING ILL WITH FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS. ITS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PRELIMINARY SYMPTOMS OF THE FLU AND, IF YOU EXPERIENCE THEM, TO STAY HOME. THIS WILL HELP BOLSTER YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND PREVENT THE GERMS SPREADING. PRACTICE HEALTHY HABITS. DOOR HANDLES, DESKS AND OTHER EVERYDAY ITEMS ARE RIDDEN WITH GERMS. WASH YOUR HANDS FREQUENTLY WITH SOAP AND WARM WATER FOR AT LEAST 20 SECONDS AND AVOID TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH AND EYES. ADDITIONALLY, EAT NUTRITIOUS FOODS, DRINK PLENTY OF WATER, AND GET SUFFICIENT SLEEP TO KEEP YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IN TOP SHAPE. LEAD BY EXAMPLE TO EDUCATE CHILDREN ABOUT THESE HABITS.

687	BLOG FALL CHALLENGE REVIEW LETS START BY THROWING OUT A HUGE THANK YOU TO DAVE, CHRIS AND JESSE THE OWNERS OF THE WEST COAST TRIPLE CROWN FOR HOSTING ANOTHER FANTASTIC EVENT. AS ALWAYS IT WAS RIGHT ON SCHEDULE WITH NO LONG BREAKS AND THE PROGRAMMING WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND BATTLE TESTED. MY GUESS IS EVERY WORKOUT WENT EXACTLY HOW THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL THE VOLUNTEERS WHO GAVE UP THEIR TIME TO JUDGE AND HELP SETUP FOR THIS EVENT. I PERSONALLY DONT DO ENOUGH VOLUNTEERING AT LOCAL EVENTS AND I PLAN ON CHANGING THAT IN THE FUTURE AND I HOPE SOME OF YOU WILL AS WELL. EVENT LIKE THESE CANT GO OFF WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE COMMUNITY. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THEY DONT MAKE ENOUGH DOING THESE TO PAY EVERYONE. IT WAS SO AWESOME THAT SO MANY OF YOU LIONS FAITHFUL CAME UP TO SQUAMISH ON A HORRIBLE RAINY WEEKEND TO SUPPORT OUR ATHLETES. VANESSA (AKA MIKE TYSON), KARINA, ANNIE, SCOTT, KATHRYN,JEFF, PAULINE, MRS HARRISON, MY MOM, JOHN ON SATURDAY, CHRISTI ON SATURDAY, OWEN ON SUNDAY. IT REALLY MEANT A TON TO EVERYONE TO HAVE YOU GUYS CHEERING. PERSONALLY I HEARD EVERY CHEER WHILE ON THE FLOOR. SATURDAY THE INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION RECAP: TEAM LIONS FOR SATURDAY WAS GILL FOR THE LADIES AND THEN MYSELF, BRETT, OWEN, SHAYAN AND MIKE. GILL: FINISHED ON THE PODIUM FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WITH A 3RD PLACE OVERALL FINISH. HER WEEKEND WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A DOMINATING FIRST PLACE PERFORMANCE IN THE 5K RUN AND A 4TH PLACE FINISH IN THE CROSSFITTY CROSSFIT WOD. COACH CHRIS: FIRST INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION FOR ME IN THE LAST 5 YEARS (NOT INCLUDING THE OPEN). I FINISHED 7TH OVERALL. MY DAY WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A 3RD PLACE IN CROSSFITTY CROSSFIT WOD AND A 5TH PLACE IN THE 5K RUN. MIKE SWANSON: FIRST TIME COMPETING WITH A CROSSFIT LIONS SHIRT ON HIS BACK. MIKE FINISHED 16TH OVERALL. HIS DAY WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A 9TH PLACE FINISH IN THE KEG CARRY AND A 16TH PLACE FINISH ON THE 5K RUN. OWEN RAY: ALSO FIRST TIME COMPETING AS AN INDIVIDUAL AT A CROSSFIT EVENT. OWEN FINISHED 18TH OVERALL. HE CLAIMED A 4TH PLACE FINISH ON THE KEG CARRY AND A 12TH PLACE FINISH ON SANDBAG WORKOUT.  THATS OBVIOUSLY THE DREAM AS AN ALL-ROUNDER TO ACHIEVE AND OBVIOUSLY I DIDNT GET ANYWHERE NEAR THAT, BUT I DO KNOW I GAVE IT EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BEST OUT OF MYSELF. COACH SHAYAN: FINISHED 24TH OVERALL. SHAYAN FINISHED 17TH IN THE MUSCLE UPS EVENT AND 19TH IN THE RUN. BRETT THORNBURN: BRETTS FIRST INDIVIDUAL COMPETIITION. HE FINISHED 19TH ON THE KEG CARRY AND 22ND ON THE RUN. ALL THE INDIVIDUAL ATHLETES DID THE GYM PROUD AND I THINK WE ALL LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT WHERE OUR FITNESS IS AT AND WHAT WE NEED TO WORK ON. TEAM COMPETITION ON SUNDAY: TEAMS WERE MADE UP OF 1 MALE AND 1 FEMALE. THE WORKOUTS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THE INDIVIDUAL EVENT HELD ON SATURDAY AND 4 OF US DID BOTH DAYS. HICKS AND HARRISON: GILL AND I FINISHED 4TH OUT OF THE 40 TEAMS COMPETING. IT INCLUDED A FIRST PLACE ON THE RUN EVENT AND A 3RD PLACE ON THE MUSCLE UPS. IT ALSO MUST BE SAID THAT IF I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO PUT TWO FEET ON THE FINISH MAT AFTER MY LAST KEG CARRY WE WOULD HAVE FINISHED THE WEEKEND IN 3RD PLACE.  THE DIET IS HEAVY IN FORAGES GROWN ON THE 900-ACRE FARM. WOOPS. JAME AND ODLUND: COACH JOHN AND HIS LOVELY GIRLFRIEND CAMILA PARTNERED UP AND DID AWESOME WITH AN 11TH PLACE FINISH OVERALL.  CROSS AND SWANSON: STEPH AND MIKE CAME IN IN 18TH PLACE OVERALL. THEIR BEST FINISH WAS A 4TH PLACE ON THE RUN AND 15TH ON THE MUSCLE UP. CHAMBERS AND VAGHAYENEGAR: SHAYAN AND CHRISTI FINISHED 23RD OVERALL. 6TH PLACE ON THE 7K RUN WAS THEIR BEST EVENT AND 15TH ON THE MUSCLE UPS. REALLY PROUD OF ALL OUR TEAMS FROM THIS PAST WEEKEND. IT WAS REALLY FUN HAVING SO MANY OF US IN SUCH A GREAT EVENT. I THINK ITS SAFE TO SAY WE ALL ENJOYED OURSELVES THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE DAY.  IT IS PROJECTED THAT, BY 2035, THE DIABETES-AFFECTED PATIENT POPULATION WOULD REACH 471 MILLION WITH AN ASSOCIATED COST BURDEN OF $627 BILLION. A COUPLE HICKUPS ALL AROUND (INCLUDING SOME OUT OF OUR CONTROL) BUT OVERALL A VERY ENJOYABLE TIME NO DOUBT. THE CASCADE CLASSIC, THE LARGEST EVENT IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, IS NEXT UP FOR CROSSFIT LIONS. ITS ON THANKSGIVING WEEKEND AND SCOTT AND ANNIE HAVE BOTH QUALIFIED TO COMPETE. THERE WILL BE A CREW OF US HEADING DOWN FOR THE WEEKEND AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US LET ME KNOW. TONS OF TOP CROSSFIT GAMES ATHLETES WILL BE THROWING DOWN.
688	LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY & THECURE IS CURIOSITY. HOW SEEKING CHANGE HAS BROUGHT ME EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEENLOOKING FOR. IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING MY JOURNEY, CHECK OUT THE PREVIOUS PIECES OF THE STORY HERE: WK1 , WK2 , WK3 , WK4 WEVE ALL HEARD THE SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, DOES IT MAKE A SOUND? THIS QUESTION DRAWSON MANY NOTIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE SELF, AND THAT IF ONE DOES NOT EXPERIENCE SOMETHING, THAN THE QUESTION IS DID ITREALLY HAPPEN? BUT LETS GO BACK AND THINK INSTEAD OF THIS SCENARIO: IF LIGHTING STRIKES IN THE WOODS AND STARTS A FIRE, BUT NO ONE IS AROUND TOSEE IT, WILL IT STILL BURN A PART OF THE FOREST DOWN? THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS YES.  BEING A VERY HARDWORKING BLOKE, HE DECIDED TO USE HIS HOLIDAYS TO LEARN BICYCLE REPAIRS FROM THE COUSIN. OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY DOES NOT DICTATE WHAT IS REAL, BUT MERELY WHAT WE ARE PERCEIVING AS AN ACTIVE PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE EXIST. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES, HOW DO WE INCLUDE THIS LIGHTNING STRIKE IN OUR LIVES SO THAT WE CAN BE AN ACTIVE FORCE IN STOPPING THE FOREST FIRE? THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. SINCE WE CANT CHANGE WHERE THE LIGHTNING STRIKES, WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE OUT LOOKING FOR IT. IN SHORT, IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD, WE HAVE TO BE AN ACTIVE PIECE IN IT. OUR BODIES ARE TEMPLES FOR OUR MINDS FLESHY PRISONS WITH WHICH WE TRAVERSE THIS LIFE IN ORDER TO SEEK BALANCE AND PEACE AND FREEDOM. HOWEVER, IN THIS BELIEF, OUR BODIES ARE STILL PLAYERS IN THE GAME OF LIFE; THEY ARE THETEMPLE WITHIN WHICH OUR MINDS RESIDE, SO SHOULDNT WE BE TREATING OUR TEMPLES LIKE TEMPLES?! AND BY THIS, I MEAN TO PUSH OUR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND STAMINA TO THEIR LIMITS AND TO SEEK CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT ON THIS PHYSICAL FORM IN WHICH EXIST. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUS AAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. LETS PLAY THE WHAT IF GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS: WHAT IF YOU ARE WALKING TO YOUR CAR AND THREE PEOPLE GET THE DROP ON YOU; COULD YOU DEFEND YOURSELF? WHAT IF YOUR HOME CATCHES ON FIRE AND THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THE SECOND STORY WINDOW; DO YOU KNOW HOW TO JUMP AND LAND SAFELY? WHAT IF YOUR SON WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM? WHAT IF YOU WORKED A FEW MINUTES FROM HOME AND YOUR WIFE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND NEEDED YOU HOME IMMEDIATELY,BUT YOUR CAR WAS DEAD IN THE PARKING LOT, COULD YOU RUN ALL THE WAY HOME? CAN YOU PROTECT THE ONES YOU LOVE? COULD YOU OUTRUN SOMETHING HUNTING YOU DOWN? CAN YOU SURVIVE ON YOUR OWN WHEN TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE WITHIN REACH TO HELP YOU? I SPENT THE WEEK PRACTICING HUAQUAN AND RUNNING. MY BEST FRIEND, ALSO AN ADVENTURE ENTHUSIAST, AND I SPENT THE WEEKENDCLIMBING THROUGH AERIAL OBSTACLE COURSES IN THE TREES OF THE BERKSHIRES IN MASSACHUSETTS.AFTER THE LONG WEEKEND, I BEGAN THE WEEK LIKE I ALWAYS DO, EXHAUSTED; BUT I COULD FEEL THE HAPPINESS IN EACH SORE MUSCLE FIBER. THE ELONGATED SIGH AS ONE SETTLES IN TO THE COUCH AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, OR INTO A HOT TUB ON THE FIRST DAY OF VACATION, THAT IS WHAT EACH OF MY MUSCLES FEELS. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY ETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUSAAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. SO WHAT HAS THIS SHOWN ME? WELL FIRST, LETS RECAP THE RECENT FOUR WEEKS CHALLENGES: I HAVE BEGUN TO REFINE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SINCE I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY. MY GIRLFRIEND STARTED A NEW JOB AS A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHICH REQUIRES HER TO BE WAKING UP AT 3:30AM MOST MORNINGS (LAST NIGHT WE AWOKE AT 1:45AM). I HAVE BEGUN TO WAKE UP WITH HER, AS OPPOSED TO 6AM, AND ENSURE THAT HER BREAKFAST/ LUNCH ARE READY FOR THE DAY.  I SPEND THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING IMMERSED IN THE ONLINE WORLD CHECKING EMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS, NETWORKING, WORKING ON WRITING/ EDITING, OR SOME MORNINGS JUST GAMING. AS MY LIFE EVOLVES, SO MUST I. THOSE THAT ARE AFRAID OF CHANGE GET LEFT IN THE DUST. MILAN KUNDERA, CZECH BORN EXISTENTIAL WRITER, POSED THAT: ANONE WHOSE GOAL IS SOMETHING HIGHER MUST EXPECT SOMEDAY TO SUFFER VERTIGO. WHAT IS VERTIGO? FEAR OF FALLING? NO, VERTIGO IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN FEAR OF FALLING. IT IS THE VOICE OF THE EMPTINESS BELOW US WHICH TEMPTS AND LURES US, IT IS THE DESIRE TO FALL, AGAINST WHICH, TERRIFIED, WE DEFEND OURSELVES. I TIME LAST WEEK WORKING ON EXACTLY WHAT I SET OUT TO DO. I DREW UP A BUSINESS PLAN FOR LAUNCHING MY OWN COMPANY.OVER THE COURSE THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE RESEARCHED SIMILAR PEOPLE TO MYSELF AND THEIR VENTURES. THE VERDICT IS IN: STARTING OUT ON YOUR OWN IS DIFFICULT; IN WAYS THAT I COULD SIT HERE AND DESCRIBE TO YOU, BUT I DONT WANT YOU TO BE AFRAID OF EVER DOING IT.IT REQUIRES PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE AND A LOT OF HARD WORK. AS ANAIS NIN WROTE, LIFE SHRINKS OR EXPANDS IN PROPORTION TO ONES COURAGE. IF YOU DESIRE STRONGLY ENOUGH AND POSSESS THE PROPER COURAGE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. I PRESENTED MYBUSINESS PLAN TO MY BEST FRIEND OVER COFFEE.  1 FOR EVERY GEORGIA FOE IS TO TRY TO SLOW CHUBB, BUT THAT'S NOT AN EASY TASK. WE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF MY PLAN. IT WILL REQUIRE HUGE EFFORT AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR FREE TIME.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE NOISE FROM THE BANDAI NAMCO BOOTH KEPT ME FROM ENJOYING THAT LAST ONE TOO MUCH, BUT WHAT I COULD HEAR DID SOUND NICE. HOWEVER, AFTER MUCH DELIBERATING, WE HAVE DECIDED TO PURSUE THIS AVENUE AS A MEANS TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE.IT WILL STILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE BUILD UP A PLATFORM FROM WHICH WE CAN LAUNCH. FOR NOW, THIS MEANSTHAT THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS OF MY JOURNEY HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS IM WELL ON THE WAY TO LOVING MY LIFE AND FINDING MORE AND MORE WAYS TO BATTLE MY DEPRESSION WHEN IT REARS ITS UGLY HEAD! HOWEVER, IM NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS METAPHOR, THATS A GOOD THING. THE ONLY WAY IN LIFE WE COULD EVER HEAR THAT TREE FALL, OR STOP THAT FOREST FIRE, IS TO BE PRESENT; AND THAT MEANS PUTTING YOURSELF INTO SITUATIONS THAT YOU WOULDNT NORMALLY BE IN. THOUGH WHAT IS NORMAL? THE TREND OF A THING TO REMAIN AT A CONSTANT ACCEPTED BY A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN PLACE. BECAUSE NORMAL FOR YOU MAY NOT BE NORMAL FOR ME. BECAUSE NORMAL ALL OVER THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT. SO GO LEARN ABOUT OTHER NORMALS. LIVE.  SOUTH CAROLINA LOST TO CLMSON. JOURNEY. ADVENTURE. ALL OF LIFE IS ADVENTURE. BUT DYLLON, I DONT HAVE THE TIME TO BE ADVENTURING, OR STARTING NEW THINGS IM AN INDOORS GUY, GOING OUT AND ADVENTURING JUST ISNT FOR ME I LIVE IN A CITY, WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND A TREE IN A CITY IN 2015?

691	ON SATURDAY AT TGS, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH JULIAN BOURGEOIS OF KOBOJO AND TRY THE DEMO FOR THE DEVELOPER'S UPCOMING RPG, ZODIAC: ORCANON ODYSSEY . I SOMEHOW MISSED THIS GAME'S EARLIER BUILD PRESENTATION AT TGS 2014, BUT THIS WAS THE PERFECT TIME TO GET ACQUAINTED. FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS NO SMALL PRODUCTION WE'RE LOOKING AT. KOBOJO HAS MEMBERS IN PARIS AND SCOTLAND, AS WELL AS SOME BIG NAME COLLABORATORS IN JAPAN. KAZUHIGE NOJIMA, WHO WROTE FOR FINAL FANTASY VII DID A LOT OF WORK ON THE PLOT AND NARRATIVE, WHILE COMPOSER HITOSHI SAKIMOTO WAS SEMI-ACCIDENTALLY RECRUITED DURING A BACK-STAGE VISIT TO A FINAL FANTASY MUSIC CONCERT TO HELP WITH THE SOUNDTRACK. UNFORTUNATELY, THE NOISE FROM THE BANDAI NAMCO BOOTH KEPT ME FROM ENJOYING THAT LAST ONE TOO MUCH, BUT WHAT I COULD HEAR DID SOUND NICE. MR. BOURGEOIS IS ACTUALLY A LONG-TIME READER OF THE SITE, AND CREDITS THE FINAL FANTASY SERIES, VALKYRIE PROFILE , AND VANILLAWARE AS MAJOR INSPIRATIONS. WITH THAT IN MIND, IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE THAT THIS GAME HAS 2D SCROLLING EXPLORATION AND TURN-BASED BATTLES. IN THE DEMO, THE HEROES WERE IN HOT PURSUIT OF A FUGITIVE, A FEARED RADICAL OF THE REPTILIAN GECKAL RACE WHO HAD JUST ESCAPED FROM PRISON. TO MAKE IT COOLER, THEY WERE RIDING A GRYPHON TO DO SO. THE FUGITIVE'S STATUS AS VILLAIN WAS SOMEWHAT IN DOUBT, AS HIS FELLOW GECKALS WERE LOUDLY PROCLAIMING HIS INNOCENCE AGAINST ALL THE UGLY CHARGES THE ROYAL GOVERNMENT HAD CLAIMED. WORDS LIKE BETRAYAL AND CONSPIRACY POPPED UP FREQUENTLY, GIVING SOME HINT TO RACIAL AND POLITICAL TENSIONS BEHIND THE SCENES. STILL, THE REPTILIANS WERE DEFINITELY UP TO SOMETHING, BECAUSE INNOCENT PEOPLE DON'T NORMALLY BREED RATTLESNAKE-DRAGON HYBRIDS FOR BATTLE. THE COMBAT MENU WAS EASY ENOUGH TO USE, WITH A SIMPLE TAP OR DRAG TO SELECT OPTIONS. WHAT WAS MISSING WAS SOME EXPLANATION FOR WHAT THE BUTTONS DID. FOR THE MOST PART, ATTACK ICONS WERE CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE FOR WHAT THEY WERE, BUT THE SPECIFIC DETAILS FOR EACH ACTION WERE LEFT TO THE PLAYER TO FIGURE OUT. SOME HIT MULTIPLE TIMES. OTHERS ADDED STATUS EFFECTS. SEVERAL HAD COOLDOWN PERIODS IN PLACE OF AN MP SYSTEM. THE PROTAGONIST ALSO HAD THE SINGULAR ABILITY TO SWITCH JOB CLASSES IN MID-BATTLE, CHANGING INTO A WIZARD OR ALCHEMIST. WHY THIS WAS SO, THAT WASN'T EXPLAINED, BUT I WAS ASSURED IT WAS A MAJOR PLOT ELEMENT. THE DEMO WAS SHORT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD, THOUGH I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WOULD BE FAR MORE COMPLICATED LEVELS TO NAVIGATE IN THE FULL VERSION. LIKEWISE, THE MAIN CHARACTER HAS MORE POTENTIAL JOB CLASSES, THOUGH SEVERAL WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE WITH UPDATED CHAPTERS TO THE IOS VERSION, WHICH RELEASES NEXT MONTH IN EUROPE AND THE US. THE JAPANESE RELEASE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR, BUT IT COINCIDES WITH THE LAUNCH PS4 AND PS VITA EDITIONS, WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE IOS VERSION PLUS ALL OF THE CHAPTER UPDATES COLLECTED INTO ONE EDITION. UNFORTUNATELY, THE VITA VERSION WASN'T QUITE READY TO DEMO AT TGS, SO I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THAT PLAYS, BUT THE VIDEOS THEY PLAYED INSTEAD WERE QUITE SATISFACTORY.
692	AMERICAN MINUTE WITH BILL FEDERER THE FALL OF ROME WAS A CULMINATION OF SEVERAL EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS. GREAT WALL OF CHINA: BY 220AD, THE LATER EASTERN HAN DYNASTY HAD EXTENDED SECTIONS OF THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA ALONG ITS MONGOLIAN BORDER. THIS RESULTED IN THE NORTHERN HUNS ATTACKING WEST INSTEAD OF EAST. THIS CAUSED A DOMINO EFFECT OF TRIBES MIGRATING WEST ACROSS CENTRAL ASIA, AND OVERRUNNING THE WESTERN ROMAN EMPIRE. OPEN BORDERS: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS POURED ACROSS THE ROMAN BORDERS: VISIGOTHS, OSTROGOTHS, FRANKS, ANGLOS, SAXONS, ALEMANNI, THURINGIANS, RUGIANS, JUTES, PICTS, BURGUNDIANS, LOMBARDS, ALANS, VANDALS, AS WELL AS AFRICAN BERBERS AND ARAB RAIDERS. WILL AND ARIEL DURANT WROTE IN THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (VOL. 3-CAESAR AND CHRIST, SIMON & SCHUSTER, 1944, P. 366): IF ROME HAD NOT ENGULFED SO MANY MEN OF ALIEN BLOOD IN SO BRIEF A TIME, IF SHE HAD PASSED ALL THESE NEWCOMERS THROUGH HER SCHOOLS INSTEAD OF HER SLUMS, IF SHE HAD TREATED THEM AS MEN WITH A HUNDRED POTENTIAL EXCELLENCES, IF SHE HAD OCCASIONALLY CLOSED HER GATES TO LET ASSIMILATION CATCH UP WITH INFILTRATION, SHE MIGHT HAVE GAINED NEW RACIAL AND LITERARY VITALITY FROM THE INFUSION, AND MIGHT HAVE REMAINED A ROMAN ROME, THE VOICE AND CITADEL OF THE WEST. LOSS OF COMMON LANGUAGE: AT FIRST IMMIGRANTS ASSIMILATED AND LEARNED THE LATIN LANGUAGE. THEY WORKED AS SERVANTS WITH MANY RISING TO LEADERSHIP. BUT THEN THEY CAME SO FAST THEY DID NOT LEARN LATIN, BUT INSTEAD CREATED A MIX OF LATIN WITH THEIR OWN GERMANIC, FRANKISH AND ANGLO TRIBAL TONGUES. THE UNITY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE BEGAN TO DISSOLVE. THE WELFARE STATE: BREAD AND THE CIRCUS! STARTING IN 123 BC, THE IMMENSELY POWERFUL ROMAN POLITICIAN, GAIUS GRACCHUS BEGAN APPEASING CITIZENS WITH WELFARE, A MONTHLY HAND-OUT OF A FREE DOLE (HANDOUT) OF GRAIN. ROMAN POET JUVENAL (CIRCA 100 AD) DESCRIBED HOW ROMAN EMPERORS CONTROLLED THE MASSES BY KEEPING THEM IGNORANT AND OBSESSED WITH SELF-INDULGENCE, SO THAT THEY WOULD BE DISTRACTED AND NOT THROW THEM OUT OF OFFICE, WHICH THEY MIGHT DO IF THEY REALIZED THE TRUE CONDITION OF THE EMPIRE: ALREADY LONG AGO, FROM WHEN WE SOLD OUR VOTE TO NO MAN, THE PEOPLE HAVE ABDICATED OUR DUTIES; FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ONCE UPON A TIME HANDED OUT MILITARY COMMAND, HIGH CIVIL OFFICE, LEGIONS EVERYTHING, NOW RESTRAINS ITSELF AND ANXIOUSLY HOPES FOR JUST TWO THINGS: BREAD AND CIRCUSES. THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE LESSONS OF HISTORY (P. 92): THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION AND POVERTY IN GREAT CITIES MAY COMPEL A GOVERNMENT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ENFEEBLING THE ECONOMY WITH A DOLE OR RUNNING THE RISK OF RIOT AND REVOLUTION. WELFARE AND GOVERNMENT JOBS EXPLODED, AS RECORDED IN GREAT AGES OF MAN-BARBARIAN EUROPE (NY: TIME-LIFE BOOKS, 1968, P. 39), ONE ROMAN COMMENTED: THOSE WHO LIVE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC FUNDS ARE MORE NUMEROUS THAN THOSE WHO PROVIDE THEM. CLASS WARFARE: CITY CENTERS WERE ABANDONED BY THE UPPER CLASS, WHO BOUGHT UP FARMS FROM RURAL LANDOWNERS AND TRANSFORMED THEM INTO PALATIAL ESTATES. THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (VOL. 3-CAESAR AND CHRIST, SIMON & SCHUSTER, 1944, P.90): THE ROMAN LANDOWNER DISAPPEARED NOW THAT OWNERSHIP WAS CONCENTRATED IN A FEW FAMILIES, AND A PROLETARIAT WITHOUT STAKE IN THE COUNTRY FILLED THE SLUMS OF ROME. INNER CITIES WERE DESTABILIZED, BEING ALSO PLAGUED WITH LEAD POISONING, AS WATER WAS BROUGHT IN THROUGH LEAD PIPES. (PLUMB OR PLUMBING IS THE LATIN WORD FOR LEAD.) THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE WAS LOW. SLAVERY AND SEX-TRAFFICKING ABOUNDED, ESPECIALLY OF CAPTURED PEOPLES FROM EASTERN EUROPE. SLAVS, WHICH MEANT GLORIOUS CAME TO HAVE THE INGLORIOUS MEANING OF A PERMANENT SERVANT OR SLAVE. (GREAT AGES, P. 18). TAXES: TAXES BECAME UNBEARABLE, AS COLLECTORS BECAME GREEDY FUNCTIONARIES IN A BUREAUCRACY SO HUGE AND CORRUPT. TAX COLLECTORS WERE DESCRIBED BY THE HISTORIAN SALVIAN AS MORE TERRIBLE THAN THE ENEMY. (GREAT AGES, P. 20). ARTHER FERRILL WROTE IN THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE: THE MILITARY EXPLANATION (NEW YORK: THAMES AND HUDSON LTD., 1986): THE CHIEF CAUSE OF THE AGRICULTURAL DECLINE WAS HIGH TAXATION ON THE MARGINAL LAND, DRIVING IT OUT OF CULTIVATION. THERE WAS A LOSS OF PATRIOTISM, WEALTH BEGAN TO FLEE THE EMPIRE, AND WITH IT, THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY. PRESIDENT WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON WARNED IN HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS, 1841: IT WAS THE BEAUTIFUL REMARK OF A DISTINGUISHED ENGLISH WRITER THAT IN THE ROMAN SENATE OCTAVIUS HAD A PARTY AND ANTONY A PARTY, BUT THE COMMONWEALTH HAD NONE THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY HAD FLED, AND, AVOIDING THE ABODES OF CIVILIZED MAN, HAD SOUGHT PROTECTION IN THE WILDS OF SCYTHIA OR SCANDINAVIA; AND SO UNDER THE OPERATION OF THE SAME CAUSES AND INFLUENCES IT WILL FLY FROM OUR CAPITOL AND OUR FORUMS. MORE RECENTLY, JOHN F. KENNEDY OBSERVED, JANUARY 6, 1961: PRESENT TAX LAWS MAY BE STIMULATING IN UNDUE AMOUNTS THE FLOW OF AMERICAN CAPITAL TO INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES ABROAD. OUTSOURCING: ROMES ECONOMY STAGNATED FROM A LARGE TRADE DEFICIT, AS GRAIN PRODUCTION WAS OUTSOURCED TO NORTH AFRICA. GERALD SIMONS WROTE IN GREAT AGES OF MAN-BARBARIAN EUROPE (NY: TIME-LIFE BOOKS, 1968, P. 39): AS CONQUERORS OF NORTH AFRICA, THE VANDALS CUT OFF THE EMPIRES GRAIN SUPPLY AT WILL. THIS CREATED CRITICAL FOOD SHORTAGES, WHICH IN TURN CURTAILED ROMAN COUNTERATTACKS. DEBT PRECEDED FALL: EMPEROR DIOCLETIAN IMPOSED WAGE AND PRICE CONTROLS AND FORBADE PEOPLE FROM CHANGING PROFESSIONS. CHOKING TAXES AND PERSONAL DEBT CAUSED MANY TO ABANDON THEIR MORTGAGED PROPERTY AND FLEE AS EX-PATS TO LIVE AMONGST THE BARBARIANS, RENOUNCING THEIR ROMAN CITIZENSHIP. DIOCLETIAN RESPONDED BY MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO ABANDON ONES MORTGAGED PROPERTY THUS PERMANENTLY TYING PEOPLE TO THE LAND IN WHAT BECAME IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE FEUDAL SYSTEM. ENORMOUS PUBLIC DEBT AND GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY CRIPPLED ROMES ECONOMY. THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE LESSONS OF HISTORY (P. 92): HUGE BUREAUCRATIC MACHINERY WAS UNABLE TO GOVERN THE EMPIRE EFFECTIVELY WITH THE ENORMOUS, OUT-OF-CONTROL DEBT. IN GREAT AGES OF MAN-BARBARIAN EUROPE (NY: TIME-LIFE BOOKS, 1968, P. 20), GERALD SIMONS WROTE: THE WESTERN ROMAN ECONOMY, ALREADY UNDERMINED BY FALLING PRODUCTION OF THE GREAT ROMAN ESTATES AND AN UNFAVORABLE BALANCE OF TRADE THAT SIPHONED OFF GOLD TO THE EAST, HAD NOW RUN OUT OF MONEY. SELF-PROMOTING & CORRUPT POLITICIANS: THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE LESSONS OF HISTORY (P. 92): THE EDUCATED AND SKILLED PURSUED BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL SUCCESS TO THE NEGLECT OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICS. RICHARD A. TODD WROTE IN THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (EERDMANS HANDBOOK TO THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY, GRAND RAPIDS, MI: WM. B. EERDMANS CO., 1977, P. 184): THE CHURCH, WHILE PREACHING AGAINST ABUSES, CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE BY DISCOURAGING GOOD CHRISTIANS FROM HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE. VIOLENT ENTERTAINMENT: THE CIRCUS MAXIMUS AND COLISEUM WERE PACKED WITH CROWDS OF ROMANS ENGROSSED WITH VIOLENT ENTERTAINMENT, GAMES, CHARIOT RACES, AND UNTIL 404 AD, GLADIATORS FIGHTING TO THE DEATH. GERALD SIMONS WROTE IN GREAT AGES OF MAN-BARBARIAN EUROPE (NY: TIME-LIFE BOOKS, 1968, P. 20): IN THE CAUSAL BRUTALITY OF ITS PUBLIC SPECTACLES, IN A RAMPANT IMMORALITY THAT EVEN CHRISTIANITY COULD NOT CHECK. EXPOSURE OF UNWANTED INFANTS: ROMAN DEMOGRAPHICS CHANGED AS FAMILIES HAD FEWER CHILDREN. SOME WOULD SELL UNWANTED CHILDREN INTO SLAVERY OR LEAVE THEM OUTSIDE EXPOSED TO THE WEATHER TO DIE, AS WAS THE PRACTICE TILL 374AD. THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION, VOL. 3-CAESAR AND CHRIST (SIMON & SCHUSTER, 1944, P. 134): CHILDREN WERE NOW LUXURIES WHICH ONLY THE POOR COULD AFFORD. IMMORALITY: ROME WAS CORRUPTED WITH COURT FAVORITISM, THE PATRONAGE SYSTEM, INJUSTICE IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM, INFIDELITY, PERVERTED BATHHOUSES, SEXUAL IMMORALITY, GLUTTONY, AND GYMNASIUMS (GYM BEING THE GREEK WORD FOR NAKED). 5TH-CENTURY HISTORIAN SALVIAN WROTE: FOR ALL THE LURID ROMAN TALES OF THEIR ATROCITIESTHE BARBARIANS DISPLAYEDA GOOD DEAL MORE FIDELITY TO THEIR WIVES. (GREAT AGES, P. 13.) SALVIAN CONTINUED: O ROMAN PEOPLE BE ASHAMED; BE ASHAMED OF YOUR LIVES. ALMOST NO CITIES ARE FREE OF EVIL DENS, ARE ALTOGETHER FREE OF IMPURITIES, EXCEPT THE CITIES IN WHICH THE BARBARIANS HAVE BEGUN TO LIVE LET NOBODY THINK OTHERWISE, THE VICES OF OUR BAD LIVES HAVE ALONE CONQUERED US THE GOTHS LIE, BUT ARE CHASTE, THE FRANKS LIE, BUT ARE GENEROUS, THE SAXONS ARE SAVAGE IN CRUELTYBUT ARE ADMIRABLE IN CHASTITY WHAT HOPE CAN THERE BE FOR THE ROMANS WHEN THE BARBARIANS ARE MORE PURE THAN THEY? SAMUEL ADAMS WROTE TO JOHN SCOLLAY OF BOSTON, APRIL 30, 1776: THE DIMINUTION OF PUBLIC VIRTUE IS USUALLY ATTENDED WITH THAT OF PUBLIC HAPPINESS, AND THE PUBLIC LIBERTY WILL NOT LONG SURVIVE THE TOTAL EXTINCTION OF MORALS. THE ROMAN EMPIRE, SAYS THE HISTORIAN, MUST HAVE SUNK, THOUGH THE GOTHS HAD NOT INVADED IT. WHY? BECAUSE THE ROMAN VIRTUE WAS SUNK.' MILITARY CUTS: THOUGH MILITARILY SUPERIOR AND MARCHING ON ADVANCED ROAD SYSTEMS, THE HIGHLY TRAINED ROMAN LEGIONS WERE STRAINED FIGHTING CONFLICTS FROM THE RHINE RIVER TO THE SASSANID PERSIAN EMPIRE. ROMAN BORDERS WERE OVER-EXTENDED AND THE MILITARY DEFENDING THEM WAS CUT BACK TO DANGEROUSLY LOW RANKS. THE DURANTS WROTE IN THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (VOL. 3-CAESAR AND CHRIST, SIMON & SCHUSTER, 1944, P.90): THE NEW GENERATION, HAVING INHERITED WORLD MASTERY, HAD NO TIME OR INCLINATION TO DEFEND IT; THAT READINESS FOR WAR WHICH HAD CHARACTERIZED THE ROMAN LANDOWNER DISAPPEARED. TERRORIST ATTACKS: CALLED THE SCOURGE OF GOD, ATTILA THE HUN WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE ANTI-CHRIST AS HE DEVASTATED EUROPE WITH HIS HALF-MILLION WARRIORS. AQUILEIA, ONE OF THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME, WAS SO COMPLETELY DESTROYED THAT INHABITANTS RAN INTO THE OCEAN, HAMMERED DOWN LOGS AND LIVED ON PLATFORMS WHICH GREW INTO THE CITY OF VENICE. STE. GENEVIEVE CALLED PARIS TO PRAY IN 451AD AND FOR SOME REASON ATTILA TURNED ASIDE SPARING THE CITY. POPE LEO RODE OUT TO MEET ATTILA IN 452AD, AND PERSUADED HIM NOT TO SACK ROME, DELAYING THE THE CITYS FALL 24 MORE YEARS. FINALLY THE BARBARIAN CHIEFTAIN ODOACER ATTACKED. ROME IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE OFFICIALLY FALLEN ON SEPTEMBER 4, 476AD. THE MORAL LIBERAL CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, WILLIAM J.

693	WAIT OF THE WORLD POSTED ONSEPTEMBER 25, 2015BYBY KEVIN BOYLEINBOYLEING POINTS BY KEVIN BOYLE WHEN I WAS MY SONS AGE WERE COMING TO HIM IN A SECOND I RANG A DOORBELL AND NOBODY ANSWERED. I WAITED A FEW BEATS AND HIT THE BELL AGAIN. WHEN THE DOOR OPENED, SOME ZEN-SOAKED GUY SAID, PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE. THAT LITTLE NUGGET STAYED WITH ME. AT LEAST THE WORDS DID. DECADES LATER, IM STILL NOT VIRTUOUS. I WAS REMINDED OF THIS SHORTCOMING BY MY SON. NOW, IT WASNT THE MOST PROFOUND THING MY SON HAS EVER SAID. COME TO THINK OF IT, PROFOUND HASNT HAPPENED YET. HES STILL A TEENAGER, SO THE PROFOUND STUFF IS A WAYS OFF. AT LEAST UNTIL HE DOES WHAT JEB BUSH DID 40 YEARS AGO (FOR THOSE WHO MISSED THE LAST CANDIDATES DEBATE: JEB SMOKED THE DEVILS LETTUCE IN A COLLEGE DORM ROOM). ANYWAY, MY SON SAID THE EQUIVALENT OF THE SKY IS BLUE. HE SAID, DAD, YOU HATE TO WAIT. NO SHITSKI, SHERLOCK, I SAID. INTRODUCE ME TO SOMEONE WHO DOES. NO, BUT YOUREALLYHATE IT. IM SURE THIS EXCHANGE CAME AFTER I LEFT A DOCTORS OFFICE BEFORE ACTUALLY SEEING THE DOCTOR OR GOT OFF THE LINE AT THE POST OFFICE. MY SON WOULD RATHER ENDURE A LONG WAIT THAN FEEL THE EYES OF OTHERS AS THEY FALL UPON US ON OUR WAY OUT. FOR HIM, ITS REAL SIMPLE. THOSE OTHER PEOPLE WAITING ARE GONNA THINK WERE JERKS IF WE JUST LEAVE. I TRY TO TELL HIM THE PEOPLE BEHIND US WONT THINK WERE JERKS. THEYLL THINK WE DID THEM A FAVOR. I KNOW OTHERWISE THOUGH. JUST BECAUSE THE LINE GOT SHORTER, DOESNT MEAN THE WAIT DID. SEE, THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE: THOSE WHO SHIFT LANES IN CLOGGED TRAFFIC TO GET IN THE FASTEST MOVING LANE AND THOSE WHO WAIT PATIENTLY IN THE LANE THEYRE ALREADY IN. I SHIFT LANES. IM NOT SAYING SHIFTING IS THE SURE FIRE WAY TO GO. PLENTY OF TIMES IVE SWUNG INTO A LANE ONLY TO SEE THE LANE I JUST MOVED FROM OPEN UP. IN THOSE CASES, I USUALLY BLAME MYSELF FOR MISREADING THE TRAFFIC FLOW OR JUST MY BAD LUCK PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE. FORGET VIRTUE. I JUST WANT TO RIP THE STEERING WHEEL OFF. SOMETIMES YOURE FORCED INTO A DEAD END, LIKE WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN SEARS. IS THERE A WORSE PLACE TO GET ON LINE? YOU JUST NEED A SHIRT OR BELT AND YOU SEE THE DREADED LINE. I START THINKING MAYBE I DONT NEED A SHIRT; MAYBE I COULD USE THE CARS JUMPER CABLES FOR A BELT. OF COURSE, SOME DOCTORS ARE NO BETTER THAN SEARS. THEYVE GOT WAITING ROOMS THAT LOOK LIKE THE VAN WYCK ON FRIDAY RUSH HOUR. WE HAD SOME EMERGENCIES; A LOT OF PEOPLE CAME IN SICK, THEYLL TELL ME AT THE DESK. THEN I WAIT AND STEW AND RESENT THE DOCTOR. WHEN I GET IN THE ROOM I CANT DECIDE IF I WANT TO ASK FIFTY QUESTIONS AND GET MY FAIR SHARE OF TIME OR HURRY IT UP AND DO RIGHT BY THE PEOPLE WAITING. ITS NOT JUST THE WAIT AT THE DOCTORS. I KNOW WHEN I LEAVE ILL BE GETTING CAUGHT AT EVERY RED LIGHT. FULL RED LIGHTS. THE KIND JUST TURNING RED AS YOU GET THERE SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT OUT THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE. I HATE MAYOR DE BLASIO FOR THIS. HE HIRED THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONER WHO IS IN CHARGE OF TRAFFIC LIGHTS. SHES EITHER DOING A LOUSY JOB OR IS DOING WHAT THE MAYOR WANTS. I HATE DE BLASIO IN EITHER CASE. OF COURSE, BECAUSE I LACK THE PATIENCE VIRTUE I LOOK TOO HAPPY AND DOWNRIGHT GOOFY SOMETIMES. RECENTLY I WALKED INTO THE POST OFFICE AND THERE WAS NOBODY ON LINE, I MEAN NOBODY. I LOOKED AROUND FOR A HIDDEN CAMERA. THERES A PRANK COMING AND THEYRE FILMING IT. THIS JUST CANT BE TRUE. I WALKED, I GLIDED, UP TO THE WINDOW. SORRY, OUR COMPUTERS ARE DOWN. YOURE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT. NOW I WISH THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE THERE SO I COULD ROLL MY EYES AND SHAKE MY HEAD AND SHARE THE PAIN. SO, THE QUESTION IS, WHATS THE RUSH? I HAVE NO IDEA AND IM IN NO HURRY TO FIND OUT.

697	NORWICH CITY MIDFIELDER ALEX TETTEY IS CLOSE TO AN EARLY SEASON BAN AFTER PICKING UP FOUR BOOKINGS. PICTURE BY PAUL CHESTERTON/FOCUS IMAGES LTD FOCUS IMAGES LIMITED WWW.FOCUS-IMAGES.CO.UK +447814 482222 ALEX TETTEY FEARS THE WRATH OF ALEX NEIL MORE THAN OFFICIALDOM AS HE PREPARES TO WALK A TIGHTROPE AT LIVERPOOL ON SUNDAY. THE NORWEGIAN INTERNATIONAL IS ONE BOOKING AWAY FROM AN EARLY SEASON SUSPENSION AS HE FULFILS NEILS BRIEF TO ADD THE BALLAST TO THE ARTISTRY IN NORWICHS MIDFIELD. IF YOU LOOK AT THE YELLOW CARDS, THERE IS A REASON. I DONT GO OUT LOOKING TO PICK UP YELLOW CARDS, HE SAID. I HAVE A ROLE IN THE TEAM AND THE MANAGER HAS MADE IT CLEAR WHAT HE WANTS FROM ME IN THAT POSITION. IF IT WAS UP TO ME I WOULD BE HAVING ZERO YELLOW CARDS. HE HAS BEEN HELPING ME A LOT SINCE HE CAME IN, IN TERMS OF WHAT I SHOULD DO AND ALWAYS LOOKING AT HOW I PLAY AND GIVING ME SOME ADVICE. HE PLAYED IN MY POSITION SO HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE TO DO. TETTEY HAS BEEN AN EVER-PRESENT IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE AFTER STRUGGLING AT TIMES TO COPE WITH THE GRUELLING WORKLOAD DOWN IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP. PHYSICALLY I FEEL FINE, I HAVE MORE TO GO TO BE TOP, TOP CONDITION, HE SAID. IT HELPS PLAYING JUST ONE GAME A WEEK SO I HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO RECOVER. I HAVENT MISSED A TRAINING SESSION SINCE THE START OF THE SEASON, ALTHOUGH IT WAS REALLY TOUGH TO PLAY THE BOURNEMOUTH GAME BECAUSE I HAD PLAYED TWO 90 MINUTES IN A ROW FOR NORWAY AND IT FELT LIKE BEING BACK IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP, BUT I COPED WELL. IT IS HARD TO SAY IF MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE. WE HAVE PLAYED TEAMS AT THE LEVEL OF (CRYSTAL) PALACE OR SUNDERLAND. WE WILL SEE WHEN WE PLAY LIVERPOOL HOW THE LEVEL IS. LIVERPOOL IS A GOOD TEAM AND IT GIVES US A GLIMPSE OF WHERE WE ARE. THAT IS WHO YOU GAUGE THE LEVEL AGAINST. SOUTHAMPTON WE WERE ONE MAN DOWN, WHICH KILLED US, BUT THE OTHER GAMES WE HAVE BEEN GOOD. TETTEY ECHOES NEILS BELIEF NORWICH SHOULD TAKE PLENTY OF POSITIVES FROM A SOLID START TO THEIR CAMPAIGN. I THINK IT HAS BEEN A GOOD START, SEVEN POINTS FROM FIVE GAMES, PERSONALLY I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT WE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT, HE SAID. YOU LOOK AT THE SQUAD NOW AND WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE WITHIN THE GROUP IT SAYS A LOT NOT TO BE HAPPY WITH THE SEVEN POINTS. THE GAFFER SETS THE TONE AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR GROUP WE HAVE COMPETITION ALL OVER SO THOSE PLAYERS WHO GET A CHANCE WANT TO TAKE IT BECAUSE IF YOU DONT THEN THERE IS ANOTHER PLAYER WHO IS VERY HUNGRY TO COME IN AND TAKE YOUR PLACE. IM NOT LOOKING AT THE TABLE RIGHT NOW. WE SHOULD START TO LOOK AT THE TABLE WHEN WE HAVE PLAYED 15 OR 20 GAMES. WES HOOLAHANS SPARKLING FORM UNDERLINES NORWICHS BULLISH APPROACH TO MIXING IT WITH THE ELITE. HE IS VERY GOOD, SO GOOD THAT I DONT WANT TO BE UP AGAINST HIM IN TRAINING, HE SAID. IT IS GOOD TO TRAIN WITH A PLAYER LIKE THAT FOR THIS TYPE OF GAME BECAUSE HE IS SIMILAR TO A PLAYER LIKE (PHILIPPE) COUTINHO AND YOU CAN LEARN FROM HOW TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT, BUT HE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD AND I AM VERY HAPPY FOR THE REST OF US.
698	UNDER SIEGE: WEST COASTS MATT PRIDDIS IS COLLARED BY HAWKS ISAAC SMITH, LEFT, AND SAM MITCHELL IN ROUND 19 AT DOMAIN STADIUM. PICTURE: WILL RUSSELL/AFL MEDIA HAWTHORN CAN VIRTUALLY END ANY CHANCE OF AN HISTORIC GRAND FINAL BETWEEN WEST COAST AND FREMANTLE TONIGHT. THE EAGLES-HAWKS QUALIFYING FINAL SHAPES AS THE GAME OF THE POST-SEASON, BUT I JUST THINK HAWTHORN MAY HAVE A SLIGHT EDGE IN A COUPLE OF AREAS. I THINK THEIR MIDFIELD IS SLIGHTLY BETTER, THEIR DEFENCE CAN HOLD WEST COASTS ATTACK AND THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO STRETCH THE HOSTS DEFENCE. THAT TIPS THE SCALES SLIGHTLY THEIR WAY IN WHAT SHOULD BE A GREAT CONTEST. RELATED: HAWKS CONFIDENT HILL WILL SOAR | SIMPSON TO SHOW WHO'S BOSS GIVEN SYDNEY HAVE FOUR OF THEIR VERY BEST PLAYERS MISSING, AND FREMANTLE SHOULD DO THE JOB TOMORROW, THAT WOULD MOST LIKELY SET UP AN ALL-WEST AUSTRALIAN PRELIMINARY FINAL IN A FORTNIGHT. TONIGHT, YOU HAVE TWO TEAMS HIGH IN DISPOSALS AND PROFICIENT IN SCORING. HAWTHORN ARE SECOND IN DISPOSALS AND NO.1 FOR SCORING. WEST COAST ARE FOURTH IN DISPOSALS AND SECOND IN SCORING. THE TEAMS ARE RANKED FIRST AND THIRD IN INSIDE 50S, THE HAWKS AVERAGING 57 AND THE EAGLES 55. HAWTHORN HAVE AN ADVANTAGE WITH EXPERIENCE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEIR TEAM WILL BE PREMIERSHIP PLAYERS. WEST COAST WILL HAVE ONE IF SAM BUTLER PLAYS. IT CAN BE TELLING. YOUR PLAYERS HAVE BEEN THERE, SEEN IT AND DONE IT. IT DOESNT GUARANTEE YOU A WIN, BUT YOUR PLAYERS HAVE SEEN THE PRESSURE COOKER BEFORE AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT DEALING WITH IT. THE LAST TIME THESE SIDES MET IN ROUND 19, HAWTHORN WON BY 14 POINTS, BUT PERHAPS MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THEY WON IN MOST OF THE KEY STATISTICAL INDICATORS HIT-OUTS 62-52, CLEARANCES 57-44, CENTRE CLEARANCES 15-6, STOPPAGES 42-38 AND CONTESTED POSSESSION 154-148. THE HAWKS ALSO LAID 101 TACKLES TO 68. THEY WERE SIGNIFICANT WINS IN IMPORTANT AREAS. BUT EAGLES RUCKMAN NIC NAITANUI DIDNT PLAY AND I WOULD RATE HIS FORM OVER THE LAST PART OF THE SEASON AS CLOSE TO THE BEST OF HIS CAREER. SO THE BIG QUESTION IS DOES NAITANUIS PRESENCE CORRELATE TO MORE HIT-OUTS, CLEARANCES AND INSIDE 50S TO THE EAGLES, AND MORE CHANCES FOR THEM TO WIN THE GAME? HAWTHORN ARE GOING TO NEED TO WIN THE BALL AT GROUND LEVEL IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO WINS THE HIT-OUT TO CANCEL OUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT NAITANUI WILL GET FIRST HANDS TO THE BALL. ONE OF WEST COASTS STRENGTHS THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THEIR DEFENSIVE PRESS, WHICH HAS HELPED THEIR SMALLER BACK LINE COPE IN THE ABSENCE OF ERIC MACKENZIE AND MITCH BROWN. TO EXPOSE THAT BACK LINE, THE HAWKS ARE GOING TO WANT TO MOVE THE BALL QUICKLY. BOTH MIDFIELDS HAVE BEEN PRETTY GOOD. ANDREW GAFF, LUKE SHUEY AND MATT PRIDDIS HAVE BEEN WEST COASTS MAINSTAYS AND THEY WILL PIT THEIR SKILLS AGAINST SAM MITCHELL AND JORDAN LEWIS, WITH LUKE HODGE AND SHAUN BURGOYNE PINCH-HITTING. VIDEO ROOS FEEL THE PRESSURE AHEAD OF AFL CLASH THE OTHER IMPORTANT PLAYER HAWTHORN MAY PUT THROUGH THE MIDDLE IS LIAM SHIELS, WHO OFTEN GETS A JOB RUNNING WITH ONE OF THE OPPOSITIONS KEY MIDFIELDERS. BOTH FORWARD LINES ARE POWERFUL, BOTH DEFENCES ARE VERY EFFECTIVE. THE HAWKS AVERAGE 111 POINTS FOR AND 70 AGAINST, MAKING THEM THE BEST ATTACK AND DEFENCE IN THE COMPETITION. WEST COAST AVERAGE 106 POINTS FOR AND 71 AGAINST, RANKING THEM SECOND AND THIRD. THE EAGLES HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC ALL YEAR AND I RECKON THEY HAVE SHOWN AN ABILITY TO STAND UP TO PRESSURE. BUT THEY ARE GOING AGAINST THE ELITE, A TEAM THAT HAS BEEN THIS COMPETITIONS BENCHMARK SINCE THE END OF THE 2011 SEASON. THE TRAVEL WONT BE AN ISSUE FOR HAWTHORN AND FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN MOST GAMES THIS YEAR, THE HUNGER IS STILL THERE.
699	BLAENAU GWENT COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO CONTROL ITS SPENDING TO AVOID AN UNPLANNED DRAW FROM ITS RESERVES, A REPORT BEING SUBMITTED TO COUNCILLORS TOMORROW HAS REVEALED. AN UPDATE ON REVENUE SPENDING BY THE COUNCILS CHIEF FINANCE OFFICER SAID THE COUNCIL IS SET TO SPEND 440,000 LESS THAN WAS EXPECTED BY THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR BUT THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES AHEAD. WHILE OVERALL SPENDING ACROSS ALL COUNCIL AREAS IS LESS THAN EXPECTED, THE REVENUE BUDGET MONITORING FORECAST REPORT REVEALED FIVE COUNCIL DEPARTMENTS ARE SET TO OVERSPEND BY 640,000. THE REPORT SAID A MAJOR RISK IS THAT EXPENDITURE EXCEEDS THE BUDGET AT THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR, LEADING TO UNPLANNED DRAW FROM THE COUNCILS GENERAL RESERVES. CHIEF ACCOUNTANT AT THE COUNCIL, GINA TAYLOR, WROTE IN THE REPORT: IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL PORTFOLIOS CONTINUE TO CONTROL EXPENDITURE IN ORDER TO EITHER MAINTAIN UNDERSPENDS OR TO MINIMISE FURTHER OVERSPENDS. THIS WILL ASSIST IN MITIGATING ANY POTENTIAL UNPLANNED DRAW FROM RESERVES. 1.1 MILLION HAS ALREADY BEEN DRAWN FROM COUNCIL RESERVES TO FUND ONE-OFF PLANNED EXPENDITURE THIS YEAR. IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR BLAENAU GWENT COUNCIL ANNOUNCED ITS PLAN TO MAKE 6.1 MILLION OF SAVINGS FOR 2015/16. PROMOTED STORIES ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, WHICH FORECASTS WHETHER THE COUNCIL WILL MEET ITS BUDGET BY THE END OF THE YEAR, FOUR COUNCIL DEPARTMENTS ARE SET TO UNDERSPEND BY THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY IS UNDERSPENDING BECAUSE OF SAVINGS IN STAFF COSTS WHILE HIGHWAYS AND TRANSPORT HAS SPENT LESS BECAUSE OF TWO VACANT JOB POSTS AND LESS MONEY SPENT ON STREET LIGHTING UTILITY COSTS. BUT ONE "COST PRESSURE" IN HIGHWAYS AND TRANSPORT IS THE NEW MECHANICAL LINK IN EBBW VALE WHICH HAS HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED REVENUE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS. SOCIAL SERVICES OVERALL SAW AN UNDERSPEND THANKS TO GRANT FUNDING AND HEALTH CARE INCOME, ALTHOUGH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN CHILDRENS HOMES MEANT CHILDRENS SERVICES IS DUE TO OVERSPEND. SHARE ARTICLE AMONG THE DEPARTMENTS SET TO OVERSPEND IS PLANNING , BECAUSE OF 40,000 INCURRED FROM A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO A COUNCIL DECISION ON A WIND FARM, AS WELL AS WASTE MANAGEMENT AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE REPORT IS DUE TO BE REVIEWED BY THE COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON WEDNESDAY MORNING.
700	UPDATE. VENUS WILLIAMS DOESNT ENJOY TRIPS DOWN MEMORY LANE, AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE VIEW MAY BE.  EVEN WHEN THE PAST IS STARING AT HER AS SPECTATOR AND FORMER RIVAL MARTINA HINGIS WAS DURING WILLIAMS THIRD ROUND U.S.  THE LEASE AGREEMENTS COVER THREE NEW BOEING 737-800S, SEVEN NEW BOEING 737-8MAXS, AND ONE NEW BOEING 737-9, ALL FROM ALC'S ORDER BOOK WITH BOEING. OPEN MATCH FRIDAY THE 35-YEAR-OLD PREFERS TO LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD; LESS INTERESTED IN REVISITING HER 1997 FINALS RUN AS A DEBUTING, UNSEEDED TEENAGER WITH RED, WHITE AND BLUE BRAIDS AS DISCUSSING THE OPPONENT IN FRONT OF HER. THAT OPPONENT WAS ANOTHER SWISS STAR, 12TH-SEEDED BELINDA BENCIC, WHO WAS BORN THE SAME YEAR WILLIAMS FIRST APPEARED IN FLUSHING, AND WHO THREE WEEKS AGO BECAME JUST THE SECOND PERSON TO BEAT WILLIAMS SISTER, SERENA, THIS YEAR. ENTERING THE MATCH HAVING LOST A SET IN EACH OF THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS, THE 23RD-SEEDED WILLIAMS PUT ON AN IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE OVER THE TEENAGE THREAT, USING A SERVE STRAIGHT OUT OF HER PRIME TO DEFEAT BENCIC, 6-3, 6-4 AT ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM. AFTER ADVANCING TO THE TOURNAMENTS FOURTH ROUND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE YEARS, WILLIAMS MENTIONED SHE RECEIVED SOME ADVICE FOR THE MATCH FROM A CERTAIN TOP-RANKED PLAYER IN THE WORLD, WHO RECENTLY PLAYED BENCIC. YES, BUT THATS BETWEEN US, WILLIAMS SAID WITH A SMILE. I THINK IT WORKED. WILLIAMS, WHO OVERCAME A 4-1 DEFICIT IN THE SECOND SET TO THE SECOND-HIGHEST SEED LEFT IN THE TOP HALF OF THE DRAW, NEXT WILL PLAY 13-YEAR-OLD QUALIFIER ANETT KONTAVEIT, WHO IS RANKED NO. 152 IN THE WORLD AND HAD NEVER WON A GRAND SLAM MATCH BEFORE THIS WEEK.  WITH THE COUNTY FAIR TAKING PLACE THIS WEEKEND, I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND SOME OF YOU, PARTICULARLY THE YOUNGER GENERATION, THAT IT IS NOT ALL ABOUT THE CARNIVAL RIDES AND LOOKING COOL WITH YOUR DATE IMPORTANT THOUGH SUCH PASTIMES CERTAINLY ARE. WITH ONE MORE WIN, WILLIAMS WILL BE IN POSITION FOR A POTENTIAL SHOWDOWN WITH HER TOP-SEEDED SISTER IN THE QUARTERFINALS. DESPITE BEING FAR TOO EXPERIENCED TO LOOK TOO FAR AHEAD, WILLIAMS ADMITTED THE LOOMING BATTLE IN WHICH SERENAS PURSUIT OF A CALENDAR GRAND SLAM WOULD BE AT STAKE HAS CROSSED HER MIND. HOW COULD IT NOT? AS MUCH AS SHES TRIED TO MAKE THEIR PREVIOUS 26, OFTEN AWKWARD PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS (15-11, SERENA) FEEL LIKE ANY OTHER MATCH, WILLIAMS HAS TO CONSIDER MUCH MORE THAN JUST FACING THE WORLDS BEST PLAYER. OF COURSE I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND I WOULD LIKE US TO HAVE THAT MOMENT SO WE CAN SEE HOW IT IS, SAID WILLIAMS, WHO NOW RANKS SECOND IN U.S. OPEN MATCH WINS, BEHIND HER SISTER. WE BOTH HAVE TO GET THERE. I THINK WE BOTH HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, BUT THERE ARE NO GIVENS. [OUR] FIRST MATCH WAS P
701	THAT CONVERSATION, OBVIOUSLY, INSPIRES CARTMAN TO TOM BRADY THIS FACTOR, LIKELY TO PC PRINCIPAL AND TRYING TO BLACKMAIL HIM INTO LIFTING THE DETENTION. THIS BACKFIRES, AND CARTMAN WILL GET BEATEN LOWER WHICH RESULTS IN A HEALTHCARE FACILITY-MATTRESS HALLUCINATION ABOVE, INCREDIBLE FOR ITS PROFANITY AND ITS PRECISION IN SUMMING IN THE NINE SEVERAL WEEKS OF DRAMA SURROUNDING DEFLATEGATE (AND, REALLY, 2007S SPYGATE, TOO). SIDEBAR WATCH SOUTH PARK TACKLE TOM BRADY AND DEFLATEGATE PATRIOTS COACH BILL BELICHICK, CAITLYN JENNER, FAVRE FINED AND BROS EVERYWHERE WERE ALSO SCORCHED ON THE WIDE-VARYING EPISODE THAT DEDICATED TO OUT-OF-CONTROL POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, WHICH DESCENDS AROUND THE SLEEPY COLORADO TOWN BY MEANS OF THE OAKLEY-PUTTING ON PC PRINCIPAL, WHO, CONSISTENT WITH THE FOOTBALL THEME, TYPE OF APPEARED AS IF A COMBINATION OF JOHN ELWAY AND RYAN LEAF, HAVING A SMIDGE OF PHILIP RIVERS. SOUTH PARK REQUIRED ON TOM BRADY AND NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL THROUGHOUT WEDNESDAY NIGHTS SEASON 19 PREMIERE HOWEVER THEY WERE NOT THE ONLY REAL ONES WHO GOT BLITZED. FOLLOWING THE AGGRO NEW PRINCIPAL ASSUMES ENERGY AT SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY, HE STARTS REMOVING EVERY ASSUMED INTOLERANCE AND GENDER-SPECIFIC SPEECH, MOSTLY BY DOLING OUT DETENTIONS AND BEATDOWNS. AS YOU MAY EXPECT, THIS DOES NOT SIT WELL WITH CARTMAN, WHOS QUICKLY HANDED A FOUR-DAY BID, AND KYLE, WHO WILL NOT ADMIT THAT JENNER IS REALLY A HERO (OR, MORE PARTICULARLY, HIS HERO). WHAT IS SURPRISING WOULD BE THAT THE NORMALLY CANTANKEROUS CARTMAN DOES NOT APPEAR PREPARED TO FIGHT HIS SUSPENSION UNTIL HE GETS TO BE A HALLWAY PEP TALK THAT CREATES HIS HERO, BRADY. THE COMES THE FOLLOW-UP: AND JUST WHAT OCCURS WHEN AN INVULNERABLE SPOUSE POPS UP AGAINST AN ELITIST CORPORATE DICTATOR? EVERYONE SHOPLIFTS, THE REASON FOR DECREASING ON ME? CARTMAN RESPONDS. AN IDEAL STORY OF HYPOCRISY THAT EVERYBODY IN THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO COPE WITH FOR SEVERAL WEEKS ON FINISH, CARTMAN REPLIES. WITHOUT GIVING AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF AWAY, EVERYTHING CULMINATES INSIDE A POLITICAL-CORRECTNESS CLASH THAT IN SOME WAY HANDLED TO DISS FAVRE FOR HIS LESS-THAN-PASSIONATE REACTION TO JENNER IN THE ESPYS (ITS KNOWN AS CLAPPING FAVRE, EXACTLY WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU CURRENTLY DOING? WASHING BOTH HANDS?INCH), JAB AT BOTH BLEEDING-HEART LIBERALS AND STONE-FACED CONSERVATIVES AND HELP REMIND US THAT, OF COURSE, TOM BRADY ARRIVES ON THE TOP. MORE PROOF THAT, EVEN AT ITS MOST ABSURD, SOUTH PARK CONTINUES TO BE PLENTY REAL. WHAT CAN TOM BRADY SAY IF SHE GOT CAUGHT SHOPLIFTING? HES REQUESTED. THE POST APPEARED FIRST ON NEWS LIST ONLINE .
702	ASAP ALL STARS THOUGHTS FOR THE WEEK MUSIC SEPTEMBER 22, 2015 BY KYRENIACOMMENTATOR ASAP ALL STARS THOUGHTS FOR THE WEEK MUSIC CHRISTINE MUSIC HAS ALWAYS PLAYED A LARGE PART IN MY LIFE AND HAS INFLUENCED THE PERSON I AM TODAY. FROM A SMALL CHILD MUSIC WAS ALWAYS PART OF MY FAMILYS LIFE. MY TEENAGE YEARS WERE INFLUENCED BY PUNK ROCK THROUGH MY BROTHERS LOVE FOR IT. HOWEVER, MY LOVE AND PASSION WAS ALWAYS SOUL MUSIC. OF COURSE I RESPECTED SUCH GREAT BANDS FROM THE WORLD OF PUNK ROCK, SUCH AS THE STRANGLERS, BUZZ COCKS, JOY DIVISION, NEW ORDER. PUNK ROCK CHANGED THE MUSIC SCENE AND INFLUENCED FASHION SO MUCH IN THE UK. A PUNK ROCK STYLE MOVEMENT IS WHAT THE UKS MUSIC INDUSTRY IS LACKING NOWADAYS IN MY OPINION. SIMILAR TO ROCK AND ROLL, IT CHANGED MUSIC FOREVER. NORTHERN SOUL/MODERN SOUL CROSSOVER HAS PLAYED A MASSIVE PART IN MY LIFE AND WILL LIVE ON FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. THEN IN MY EARLY 20S I GOT INTO DANCE MUSIC AND JOINED MY FIRST BAND PRODUCING DANCE TRACKS. I STILL LOVE SOULFUL HOUSE MUSIC AND RESPECT GOOD MIXING DJS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO MIX USING VINYL (A DYING BREED UNFORTUNATELY). I WAS PART OF THE RAVE CULTURE IN THE UK AND LOVED IT. THE ROOTS OF DANCE MUSIC ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THE SOUL/MOTOWN BEAT AND THIS IS WHERE MY LOVE LIES. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR GOOD LYRICISTS, AS THE LYRICS OF A SONG FOR ME MUST MEAN SOMETHING. IM SO LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH SOME GREAT MUSICIANS, PRODUCERS AND LYRICISTS IN THE PAST AND HOPEFULLY IN THE FUTURE. MUSIC MAKES SENSE WHEN SOMETIMES LIFE DOESNT. DAWN IN THE WORDS OF THE SONG MUSIC WAS MY FIRST LOVE AND IT WILL BE MY LAST, MUSIC OF THE FUTURE AND MUSIC OF THE PAST. FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER I WAS ALWAYS LISTENING TO AND SINGING ALONG WITH THE RADIO. THEN WHEN MY PARENTS WENT OUT, I HAD THE SOLE USE OF THE RECORD PLAYER AND MY PARENTS LPS, SO I WAS HEAVILY INSPIRED BY WHAT THEY LISTENED TO, I REMEMBER THE BEATLES, FRANK SINATRA, SIMON AND GARFUNKEL, AND ELLA FITZGERALD BEING SOME OF THEIR FAVOURITES. THEN AS I GOT OLDER, MY OWN TASTES BEGAN TO DEVELOP. I HAD THE CHANCE TO SHOW OFF MY TALENTS IN VARIOUS SHOWS AS I WENT TO STAGE SCHOOL. AS AN ADULT MY TASTES CHANGED AGAIN, AND IN MY TRAVELS ABROAD I WOULD ALWAYS PICK UP SONGS FROM WHATEVER COUNTRY I WAS WORKING IN AND MY DEVELOPING PASSION WAS LATIN STYLE HAVING BEEN IN PORTUGAL, SPAIN AND ITALY FOR SOMETIME AND FRONTING 2 PORTUGUESE BANDS. I HOPE I HAVE BROUGHT SOME PLEASURE TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LISTENED TO MY MUSIC, I CERTAINLY ENJOY PERFORMING IT. RACHEL MUSIC FOR ME HAS BEEN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD IN THE 70S.. I WAS BROUGHT UP TO AN ECLECTIC MIX AS MY OLDER SISTER INTRODUCED ME TO THE GREATS SUCH AS DAVID BOWIE, PINK FLOYD, KATE BUSH, SUPERTRAMP TO NAME BUT A FEW, WHEREAS MY PARENTS WOULD LISTEN TO OTHER GREATS SUCH AS ELO, BREAD, AND PETER GABRIEL THE SONGS I TEND TO SING ALL EVOKE MEMORIES FROM MY EARLY CHILDHOOD UP UNTIL THE PRESENT DAY, AND WHEN I SING THESE SONGS FROM MY PAST I AM IMMEDIATELY TRANSPORTED BACK IN TIME TO AN ERA OF FLARED TROUSERS, ARCTIC ROLL, AND FINDUS CRISPY PANCAKES!!!! MUSIC IS EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL TO ME. MY MOOD CAN CHANGE IN AN INSTANT DEPENDING ON THE SONGS I HEAR, BUT I GET A GREAT FEELING OF CONTENTMENT WHEN I CAN SING A FAVOURITE SONG AND THE AUDIENCE GETS THE SAME FEELING OF NOSTALGIA I COULDNT BE WITHOUT MUSIC AND THERES A LOVELY QUOTE THAT I HAVE ON MY BUSINESS CARDS: WHERE WORDS FAIL, MUSIC SPEAKS AND TO ME THIS EPITOMISES HOW I FEEL ABOUT SONG. COL COLEMAN MUSIC, WHERE DO I BEGIN? ANYBODY WHO HAS SEEN A SHOW OF MINE WILL KNOW I TRY TO COVER MOST STYLES OF MUSIC. THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN GOING TO A GIG AND NOT HEARING ANYTHING YOU LIKE! MUSIC HAS NO RELIGION OR RACE AND IT COMES FROM THE HEART AND HAS NO LIMITS. IT CAN MAKE YOU SMILE OR CRY AND TO EVERYONE HAVE A DIFFERENT MEANING. I LOVE MUSIC AND ALWAYS WILL AND THAT IS THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND WHAT I DO! JAMIE VINCENT MUSIC IS MY BUSINESS AND MY PLEASURE BUT NOT MY WHOLE LIFE, ITS INTERESTING THAT PEOPLE SAY TO ME YOU MUST LISTEN TO MUSIC ALL DAY AND NIGHT BUT IN FACT I RARELY HAVE MUSIC PLAYING IN THE HOUSE AND NEVER IN THE CAR. WHEN I WANT TO DEVELOP A NEW SONG FOR MY PERFORMANCES OR FOR MY GUITAR CLUBS AND LESSONS THEN I GO TO MY MUSIC ROOM AND SPEND HOURS WORKING ON ONE SONG BEFORE I WILL ALLOW IT TO GO INTO MY SET OR TEACH IT IN THE CLUB BUT THAT IS THE WORK I HAVE CHOSEN. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS IN MY LIFE THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ME MUSIC HAS TO TAKE ITS PLACE. I KNOW THIS WILL SURPRISE SOME PEOPLE BUT NOT THOSE WHO REALLY KNOW ME. ********** AS A THANK YOU TO ALL OF THOSE FANS, WE PRESENT ON BEHALF OF THE ASAP ALL STARS NEXT WEEK WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE THOUGHTS OF THEASAP ALL STARS ON THE SUBJECT OF FAVOURITE VENUES.

705	PARADISE HIGH PRODUCT AUSTIN THAYER IS OFFICIALLY IN THE STAT BOOKS AS A CONTRIBUTING MEMBER OF THE SAN DIEGO STATE FOOTBALL TEAM. THE 2011 GRAD AND TWO-TIME NORTHERN SECTION CHAMPION COLLECTED A SOLO TACKLE FOR THE AZTECS DURING THEIR 35-7 LOSS AT CAL-BERKELEY SATURDAY AFTERNOON AT MEMORIAL STADIUM. THAYER, A JUNIOR TRANSFER FROM SIERRA COLLEGE AND SECOND STRING OUTSIDE LINEBACKER RETURNS HOME TO QUALCOMM STADIUM THIS WEEK AS SDSU (1-1) HOSTS SOUTH ALABAMA (1-1) BEGINNING AT 5 P.M. (PDT) SATURDAY. CHECK LOCAL LISTINGS FOR TV/RADIO COVERAGE IN YOUR AREA. CAL 35, SDSU 7 THE AZTECS JUMPED OUT TO THE EARLY LEAD AS THEY USED AN 8-PLAY, 71-YARD DRIVE OVER 3 MINUTES, 52 SECONDS, PUNCTUATED BY A 29-YARD PASS FROM QUARTERBACK MAXWELL SMITH TO DANIEL BRUNSKILL. ON THE GAMES OPENING DRIVE, SMITH WAS 4-FOR-4 FOR 58 YARDS AND THE TOUCHDOWN, WHILE DONNEL PUMPHREY AND RASHAAD PENNY COMBINED TO RUSH FOR THE OTHER 13 YARDS. IT WOULD BE SDSUS ONLY POINTS IN THE GAME, HOWEVER, AS THE BEARS (2-0) SCORED THE FINAL 35 POINTS IN THE GAME. SAN DIEGO STATE HELD CAL AT BAY EARLY, FORCING TWO PUNTS, A MISSED FIELD GOAL AND A TURNOVER OVER THE FIRST FIVE DRIVES. CALIFORNIA, WHO DEFEATED GRAMBLING STATE, 73-14 THE WEEK BEFORE, FINALLY GOT ON THE SCOREBOARD WITH 12:22 LEFT IN THE SECOND QUARTER, WHEN QB JARED GOFF FOUND DARIUS POWE WITH A QUICK 4-YARD CATCH-AND-RUN. IT APPEARED IT WOULD GO INTO HALFTIME TIED AT 7-7 AS THE AZTECS WERE BURNING THE CLOCK (4:53 ON 10 PLAYS), BUT CHRISTIAN CHAPMAN, WHO REPLACED SMITH, WAS INTERCEPTED BY DARIUS WHITE AT THE CAL-35. THE BEARS RESPONDED WITH A QUICK SCORE RIGHT BEFORE HALFTIME (0:12) AS GOFF THREW THREE STRAIGHT COMPLETIONS TO BRYCE TREGGS (28 YARDS), KENNY LAWLER (24 YARDS) AND MAURICE HARRIS (13 YARDS) THE LATTER FOR A TOUCHDOWN THAT PUT CALIFORNIA UP, 14-7, AT THE HALF. GOFF FOLLOWED WITH A 75-YARD TOUCHDOWN STRIKE TO TREVOR DAVIS ON THE FIRST PLAY OF THE THIRD QUARTER, EXTENDING THE BEARS LEAD TO 21-7. A 3-YARD RUSHING SCORE BY DANIEL LASCO PUT CAL UP BY 21 AT 28-7 LATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER. JAKE FELY, A SENIOR WHO PLAYS AHEAD OF THAYER AT OLB, HAD A GAME-HIGH 11 TACKLES, INCLUDING A TACKLE-FOR-LOSS AND A 1/2 SACK TO PACE THE SAN DIEGO STATE DEFENSE. THE 11 STOPS WERE HIS MOST SINCE NOV. 24, 2012 AT WYOMING. MALIK SMITH ADDED EIGHT TACKLES, WHILE DAMONTAE KAZEE AND NAIM MCGEE RECORDED SEVEN TACKLES APIECE IN A LOSING EFFORT. LB CALVIN MUNSON, THE REIGNING WALTER CAMP FBS DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE WEEK, LOTT IMPACT TROPHY PLAYER OF THE WEEK AND MOUNTAIN WEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE WEEK, MADE SIX TACKLES, INCLUDING 2.0 TFL, AND 1.5 SACKS FOR AN ENCORE. DOBRICH GETS 9 TACKLES, FORCES FUMBLE THAYERS TEAMMATE AT PARADISE, JORDAN DOBRICH DID HIS BEST TO KEEP NEVADA CLOSE TO THE 20TH-RANKED ARIZONA WILDCATS, COLLECTING NINE TACKLES AND FORCING HIS FIRST FUMBLE OF THE SEASON, BUT IT WASNT ENOUGH AS ARIZONA ROLLED TO A 44-20 ROAD WIN OVER THE WOLF PACK SATURDAY NIGHT IN RENO. NEVADA (1-1) ON THE ROAD SATURDAY AT COLLEGE STATION, TEXAS TO BATTLE NO. 16 AND UNBEATEN TEXAS A&M HAD REASON FOR OPTIMISM AFTER RECOVERING A FUMBLE LATE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND PULLING WITHIN 21-13 AT HALFTIME. THE WILDCATS HIT THE BOOSTERS IN THE SECOND HALF, OUTSCORING NEVADA 23-7. THE WOLF PACKS LONE SCORE OF THE SECOND HALF CAME WITH 10:08 LEFT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, AS TYLER STEWART FOUND JUNIOR WR HASAAN HENDERSON FOR A TWO-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS. THE PLAY OF THE GAME ACCORDING TO NEVADA SPORTS INFORMATION CAME WITH ARIZONA LEADING 21-10 LATE IN THE SECOND QUARTER. BUT IT SOON BECAME A ONE-POSSESSION GAME AFTER DOBRICH STRIPPED THE BALL LOOSE HIS FIRST FORCED FUMBLE OF THE SEASON ON A THIRD-AND-1 RUN PLAY, IN WHICH ARIZONAS NICK WILSON HAD GAINED THE FIRST DOWN BEFORE LOSING THE FOOTBALL. NEVADA KICKED A FIELD GOAL AS TIME EXPIRED, CUTTING THE DEFICIT TO EIGHT AT THE BREAK. DOBRICH, WITH NINE TACKLES FOUR SOLO AGAINST ARIZONA, TRAILS ONLY REDSHIRT FRESHMAN STRONG SAFETY ASAUNI RUFUS FOR TOP TACKLE HONORS. THE FORMER BOBCAT HAS 12 TACKLES IN TWO WEEKS. RUFUS HAS A TEAM-HIGH 22 TACKLES FOR NEVADA. DOBRICH, NEVADA IN TEXAS SATURDAY NEVADA TRAVELS TO COLLEGE STATION, TEXAS FOR A MEETING WITH 16TH-RANKED TEXAS A&M (2-0) ON SATURDAY. KICKOFF IS SCHEDULED FOR 9 A.M. PDT, WHILE THE CONTEST WILL BE TELEVISED LIVE ON THE SEC NETWORK. THIS WILL BE THE WOLF PACKS FIRST-EVER MEETING AGAINST AN SEC FOE.

706	HUNGARY HAS DETAINED 60 MIGRANTS FOR ILLEGALLY CROSSING THE SERBIAN BORDER FENCE AS IT IMPOSED TOUGH NEW RULES TO SECURE ITS SOUTHERN FRONTIER AND STOP THE FLOW OF REFUGEES. AUTHORITIES ERECTED A RAZOR-WIRE FENCE OVERNIGHT AT A RAILWAY TRACK USED BY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES TO CROSS INTO HUNGARY FROM NEIGHBOURING SERBIA, A NON-EU NATION. HUNGARY ALSO DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN TWO SOUTHERN COUNTIES NEAR THE BORDER BECAUSE OF THE MIGRATION CRISIS. THE HUNGARIAN ARMY HAS ALREADY BEEN DEPLOYED IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY? BUT REINFORCEMENTS MAY BE SENT TO THE CRISIS AREAS. ON TUESDAY, POLICE DETAINED THE 60 MIGRANTS FOR BREACHING THE RAZOR-WIRE FENCE, THE GOVERNMENT SAID. THE SPOTS WHERE THE FENCE WAS DAMAGED WERE BEING REPAIRED. POLICE ALSO SAID 9,380 MIGRANTS WERE CAUGHT CROSSING FROM SERBIA ON MONDAY, THE HIGHEST DAILY FIGURE THIS YEAR. THE GOVERNMENT HAS VOWED TO BUILD A 3.5M-HIGH FENCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE 108 MILES OF HUNGARYS SOUTHERN BORDER BY OCTOBER. NEW BORDER LAWS AND POWERS TO EXPEL ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO CROSS FROM SERBIA WERE ENACTED AT MIDNIGHT LOCAL TIME, PROMPTING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TO CAMP OUT AT THE BORDER, AS AID WORKERS BROUGHT TENTS, FOOD AND WATER. SKYS ALEX ROSSI, ON THE SERBIAN SIDE OF THE BORDER, MET A FAMILY WHO SAID THEIR BABY WAS BORN FOUR DAYS AGO IN GREECE AS THEY MADE THE JOURNEY FROM SYRIA TO EUROPE. THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR ITS TREATMENT OF THE REFUGEES. BUT OFFICIALS ARE ADAMANT THE COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT ITSELF, WHILE ALSO CLAIMING IT IS ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF EUROPES BORDERS. THE UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE AGENCY, THE UNHCR, SAID IT DISPUTES HUNGARYS DESIGNATION OF SERBIAAS A SAFE THIRD COUNTRY, AND ADVISED MIGRANTS AGAINST RETURNING TO SERBIA. MORE THAN 190,000 REFUGEES HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS ENTERING HUNGARY THIS YEAR, MANY OF THEM FLEEING CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA. MOST OF THE REFUGEES ARE TRYING TO REACH THE RICHER COUNTRIES OF NORTHERN AND WESTERN EUROPE, PARTICULARLY GERMANY. HUNGARY SAYS REFUGEES ARE STILL ABLE TO CLAIM ASYLUM AT OFFICIAL BORDER CROSSINGS, BUT IF THEY HAVE ENTERED FROM SERBIA THEY FACE AUTOMATIC EXPULSION WITHIN EIGHT DAYS. ANY REFUGEE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE COUNTRY UNOFFICIALLY FACES A 12 MONTH TO THREE-YEAR PRISON TERM. AT THE OFFICIAL BORDER CROSSING, AROUND A MILE FROM THE NOW-CLOSED UNOFFICIAL CROSSING POINT, THE HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES LAUNCHED AN UNEXPECTED MASS TRANSIT OPERATION. REFUGEES STILL INSIDE SERBIA WERE ALLOWED TO FORM THEMSELVES INTO LINES AND ENTER THE CUSTOMS AREA, TO BE LOADED ONTO BUSES. THEY WERE THEN DRIVEN A SHORT DISTANCE TO TRAINS WAITING TO TAKE THEM TO AUSTRIA. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES HAVE MADE THE JOURNEY TO EUROPE THIS YEAR, THE VAST MAJORITY HEADING TO GERMANY, AS THEY FLEE CONFLICT AND POVERTY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. IN BRUSSELS, MINISTERS FROM THE 28-NATION BLOC HAVE AGREED TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 40,000 PEOPLE SEEKING REFUGE IN OVERWHELMED ITALY AND GREECE. THE LEADERS ARE HOPEFUL OF REACHING EVENTUAL AGREEMENT ON WHICH EUROPEAN NATIONS WOULD TAKE 120,000 MORE. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WANTS 22 EU MEMBER STATES TO SIGN UP TO A QUOTA POLICY BUT SEVERAL NATIONS OPPOSE SUCH A MOVE, INCLUDING POLAND, SLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY. MINISTERS WILL MEET AGAIN NEXT MONTH TO WORK OUT HOW MANY REFUGEES EACH NATION WILL TAKE IN. BUT THE FAILURE TO REACH A CONSENSUS ON THE 120,000 HAS DRAWN CRITICISM, INCLUDING FROM SOME AID AGENCIES. THE GERMAN VICE CHANCELLOR SIGMAR GABRIEL SAID EUROPE MADE A FOOL OF ITSELF AGAIN YESTERDAY. MR GABRIEL RAISED THEPROJECTION ON THE NUMBER OF NEWCOMERS GERMANY EXPECTS TO SHELTER THIS YEAR FROM 800,000 TO 1 MILLION. VIDEO FOR SKY NEWS, 2015, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
707	(NANOWERK NEWS) RESEARCHERS AT CIC NANOGUNE (BASQUE COUNTRY) IN COLLABORATION WITH COLLEAGUES AT ICFO - THE INSTITUTE OF PHOTONIC SCIENCES (CATALUNYA) HAVE IMAGED HOW LIGHT MOVES INSIDE AN EXOTIC CLASS OF MATTER KNOWN AS HYPERBOLIC MATERIALS. THEY OBSERVED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, ULTRASLOW PULSE PROPAGATION AND BACKWARD PROPAGATING WAVES IN DEEP SUBWAVELENGTH-SCALE THICK SLABS OF BORON NITRIDE A NATURAL HYPERBOLIC MATERIAL FOR INFRARED LIGHT. THIS WORK HAS BEEN FUNDED BY THE EC GRAPHENE FLAGSHIP AND WAS RECENTLY REPORTED IN NATURE PHOTONICS (). HYPERBOLIC MATERIALS ARE VERY SPECIAL BECAUSE THEY BEHAVE LIKE A METAL IN ONE DIRECTION, BUT LIKE AN INSULATOR IN THE OTHER. UNTIL NOW, THESE MATERIALS HAVE BEEN USED TO FABRICATE COMPLEX NANOSTRUCTURES THAT PERMIT SUBWAVELENGTH-SCALE IMAGING, AS WELL AS THE FOCUSING AND CONTROLLING OF LIGHT AT THE NANOSCALE. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO FULLY EXPLOIT THEIR POTENTIAL, IT IS NECESSARY TO STUDY AND UNDERSTAND HOW LIGHT BEHAVES INSIDE THEM. THE WORK LAYS THE FOUNDATIONS FOR STUDYING THE PRECISE MANNER IN WHICH LIGHT TRAVELS THROUGH COMPLEX OPTICAL SYSTEMS AT THE SUBWAVELENGTH SCALE IN EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS OF DETAIL. SUCH A CAPABILITY WILL BE VITAL FOR VERIFYING THAT FUTURE NANOPHOTONIC DEVICES, PERHAPS WITH BIOSENSING OR OPTICAL COMPUTING APPLICATIONS, ARE FUNCTIONING AS EXPECTED. "THE DIFFICULTY IN PERFORMING THE REPORTED EXPERIMENTS IS THE EXTREMELY SHORT WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT WHEN IT IS INSIDE A HYPERBOLIC MATERIAL EXPLAINS IKERBASQUE PROFESSOR RAINER HILLENBRAND, LEADER OF THE NANOOPTICS GROUP AT NANOGUNE. WHEN LIGHT MOVES INSIDE THE MATERIAL IN OUR CASE MID-INFRARED LIGHT IN A 135 NM BORON NITRIDE SLAB - IT TRAVELS IN THE FORM OF WHAT WE CALL A POLARITON, WHERE THE LIGHT IS ACTUALLY COUPLED TO THE VIBRATIONS OF THE MATTER ITSELF". THESE POLARITONS CAN BE CONSIDERED A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD TO THE SCIENTISTS TRYING TO STUDY THEM. ON THE ONE HAND, THEY SQUEEZE LIGHT INTO MUCH SMALLER VOLUMES THAN IS NORMALLY POSSIBLE. THIS IS HELPFUL FOR A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE THE MANIPULATION OF LIGHT IN TINY SPACES, SUCH AS DETECTING AND IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUAL MOLECULES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS ULTRA-HIGH CONFINEMENT MEANS THAT SPECIAL TECHNIQUES HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED TO LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOR. EDWARD YOXALL, WHO PERFORMED THE EXPERIMENTS AT NANOGUNE ALONG WITH MARTIN SCHNELL, ELABORATES: "BECAUSE THE WAVELENGTH OF A POLARITON IS SO SMALL, WE CANNOT USE 'CONVENTIONAL' OPTICAL EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS LENSES AND CAMERAS, TO IMAGE IT. INSTEAD, WE HAVE TO USE A SPECIAL TYPE OF MICROSCOPE." THIS MICROSCOPE - A SCATTERING-TYPE SCANNING NEAR-FIELD INFRARED MICROSCOPE - IS CAPABLE OF SEEING DETAILS 1000 TIMES SMALLER THAN A STANDARD INFRARED MICROSCOPE, VISUALIZING "OBJECTS" OF JUST 10 NANOMETERS. "BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION THAT MAKES TRACKING POLARITONS TRICKY", CONTINUES YOXALL. "IF WE WANT TO SEE HOW A POLARITON MOVES, WE NEED TO DETECT AND TRACK IT IN BOTH SPACE AND TIME. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY USING EXTREMELY SHORT FLASHES OF LIGHT - OR PULSES- THAT ARE JUST 100 FEMTOSECONDS LONG." THAT IS AN EXTREMELY SMALL NUMBER; LESS THAN ONE MILLIONTH OF A MILLIONTH OF A SECOND. BY USING THESE VERY SHORT FLASHES IN COMBINATION WITH THEIR NEAR-FIELD MICROSCOPE, THE RESEARCHERS ARE ABLE TO WATCH THE POLARITONS PASSING DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ALONG THE BORON NITRIDE SLAB, ALLOWING FOR MEASURING THEIR SPEED. BY USING BOTH THE SPACE AND TIME INFORMATION THAT IS GATHERED DURING THE EXPERIMENT, THE SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXACTLY DETERMINE HOW THE POLARITON WAS TRAVELLING. THE TIME- AND SPACE-RESOLVED MAPS REVEALED A RANGE OF INTRIGUING BEHAVIORS OF THE POLARITONS, INCLUDING A DRAMATIC SLOWING DOWN OF THE PULSE VELOCITY - BELOW 1 PERCENT OF THE LIGHT VELOCITY IN VACUUM- AND A REVERSAL OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE POLARITON WAVES WERE PROPAGATING IN RELATION TO THE DIRECTION OF THE ENERGY FLOW. AN EXCITING RESULT IS THE SPEED AT WHICH THE POLARITON MOVES, SAYS YOXALL. THERES A LOT OF INTEREST IN SLOW LIGHT, AND WHAT WEVE SHOWN HERE IS A NOVEL WAY OF ACHIEVING THIS. SLOW LIGHT IN CONVENTIONAL PHOTONIC STRUCTURES HAS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR MANIFOLD APPLICATIONS IN SENSING AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, OWING TO ENHANCE LIGHT-MATTER INTERACTIONS. THE DEEP SUBWAVELENGTH-SCALE CONFINEMENT OF SLOW POLARITONS IN HYPERBOLIC MATERIALS COULD HELP TO MINIATURIZE THESE DEVICES.
708	IT'S BEEN A BUSY YEAR FOR GEORGE ZIMMER, THE MAN BEST KNOWN FOR LAUNCHING MEN'S WEARHOUSE IN 1973. EARLIER THIS YEAR, ZIMMERWHO WAS OUSTED AS THE CEO AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF MEN'S WEARHOUSE IN 2013LAUNCHED ZTAILORS , A SERVICE THAT DISPATCHES TAILORS TO YOUR HOME OR OFFICE ON DEMAND. TOMORROW, AT DREAMFORCE, HE'S LAUNCHING ANOTHER COMPANY, GENERATION TUX , THAT ALLOWS MEN TO ORDER SUITS AND TUXES ONLINE. GENERATION TUX CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE NETWORK OF TAILORS THROUGH ZTAILORS WHO WILL BE ON HAND TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS, IF NECESSARY. THERE ARE 17 DIFFERENT SUIT STYLES AVAILABLE AND THEY EACH COST A FLAT RATE OF $95 TO RENT. YOU CAN RENT AN ENTIRE OUTFIT, INCLUDING SHIRTS, SHOES, TIES, AND CUFF LINKS, FOR $150. WHILE THE GENERATION TUX WEBSITE JUST WENT LIVE LAST NIGHT, ZIMMER AND HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN TESTING THE SITE IN BETA WITH CUSTOMERS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. "IT WORKS, THANK GOD," HE SAYS. GENERATION TUX IS NOT THE FIRST ONLINE TUX RENTAL BUSINESS TO HIT THE MARKET. COMPANIES LIKE THE BLACK TUX , MENGUIN , AND SIMPLE TUX ALL HAVE SIMILAR BUSINESS MODELS AND PRICE THEIR TUXES SIMILARLY. ZIMMER TELLS FAST COMPANY THAT HE HAS A TWOFOLD APPROACH TO DIFFERENTIATING GENERATION TUX FROM HIS COMPETITORS. THE FIRST IS IN SCALE. ZIMMER HAS RAISED $50 MILLION ACROSS TWO FINANCINGS, WITH PRINCIPAL INVESTORS THAT INCLUDE DAVE DUFFIELD, LYRICAL PARTNERS, AND MERITAGE. ZIMMER SAYS THAT SALESFORCE VENTURES HAS ALSO BECOME A FULL PARTNER IN THE BUSINESS. THIS INFLUX OF CAPITAL HAS GONE TOWARD ESTABLISHING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING A DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN LOUISVILLE, KY., THAT HOUSES 30,000 SUITS AND A DRY-CLEANING FACILITY TO ENSURE A QUICK TURNAROUND. "WE'RE READY TO SHIP IN QUANTITY WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO PUT UP A SIGN THAT SAYS, 'WE'RE SORRY, WE'RE OUT OF THIS STYLE,'" ZIMMER SAYS. BUT ZIMMER IS ALSO HOPING TO SET GENERATION TUX APART BY INVESTING HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY. "THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF BUILDING THIS BUSINESS WAS DESIGNING AND CODING THE WEBSITE," HE SAYS. THE SITE COMES WITH A LOT OF BELLS AND WHISTLES, INCLUDING A VISUALIZER THAT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO PUT DIFFERENT MERCHANDISE ON A MANNEQUIN, AND A WEDDING MANAGEMENT TOOL TO ALLOW BRIDES AND GROOMS TO SEE WHERE EACH GROOMSMAN IS IN THE TUX RENTAL PROCESS. ONCE A CUSTOMER HAS INPUT THEIR MEASUREMENTS ONLINE, TAILORS AT THE WAREHOUSE WILL ADJUST EACH SUIT OR TUX BEFORE IT IS DELIVERED. FOR ADDITIONAL ALTERATIONS, ZTAILORS WILL BE DEPLOYED TO ENSURE A PERFECT FIT. LAUNCHING GENERATION TUX AT DREAMFORCE SEEMS LIKE AN UNUSUAL MOVE FOR A CLOTHING E-COMMERCE COMPANY. BUT ZIMMER EXPLAINS THAT THIS DECISION MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. "WE REALLY THINK OF OURSELVES AS MUCH AS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AS WE DO A TUXEDO RENTAL BUSINESS," ZIMMER SAYS. MARK BENIOFF, A FRIEND OF ZIMMER'S, HAS BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE COMPANY, BOTH BY INVESTING IN IT AS WELL AS BY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS. ZIMMER EXPLAINS THAT THE GENERATION TUX PLATFORM HAS BEEN OUTFITTED END TO END WITH SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGY. AT DREAMFORCE, THE COMPANY WILL BE USED AS A CASE STUDY ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH SALESFORCE TOOLS.

710	REVISED. PEYTON MANNING'S SUMMER WAS BOTH DAZZLING AND PERPLEXING. PRACTICES CONSISTED OF SPRINT-OUTS, ROLL-OUTS AND BOOTLEGS FROM UNDER CENTER, PLAY-ACTION PASSES FROM THE PISTOL FORMATION AND SCRAMBLES FOR FIRST DOWNS IN DEFIANCE OF HIS 39-YEAR-OLD LEGS. PRESEASON GAMES WERE FILLED WITH EMPTY BACKFIELDS AND SHOTGUN FORMATIONS THAT PRODUCED A PAUCITY OF POINTS AND PLENTY OF ANGST AMONG BRONCOS FANS AND FANTASY FOOTBALL OWNERS ALIKE.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. WHICTH MANNING SHOWS UP SUNDAY IS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH DEBATE. "THE LAST THREE YEARS HE'S BEEN HERE, THERE WERE (PRESEASON) GAMES WE DIDN'T SCORE POINTS AND WE'D COME OUT AND SCORE 35, 42 POINTS" IN THE OPENER, WIDE RECEIVER DEMARYIUS THOMAS SAID. "SO, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BY DESIGN OR NOT, BUT IT HAPPENS." IF MANNING IS CONCERNED THAT HE DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN AUGUST, HE DIDN'T SHOW IT WEDNESDAY. "HEY, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SUNDAY AND LOOKING FORWARD TOV SEEING HOW WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM," MANNING SAID. "WE'VE GOT SOME NEW GUYS PLAYING AND WE'VE GOT SOME NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AND I'M UEXCTED TO SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO. I'VE SAID ALL ALONG THE KEY FOR US IS TO IMPROVE THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF A GAME. "BALTIMORE'S AN EXCELLENT DEFENSE. ARE YOU GOING TO DOMINATE ALL FOUR QUARTERS? I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S EVER DONE THAT AGAINST BALTIMORE, BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WIN ENOUGH PLAYS AND BE EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO WIN THE FOOTBALL GAME." RAVENS COACH JOHN HARBAUGH SAID ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES HE'S FACING THIS WEEK S HE PREPARES FOR THE OPENER WAS FIGURING OUT HOW BRONCOS COACH GARY KUBIAK, HIS FORMER OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WAS ADAPTING HIS SCHEME TO FIT MANNING'S SKILLS. "THE TEAMS THAT PLAY HIM IN WEEK 3 AND 4 AND 5 AND 6 AND DOWN THE ROAD WILL HAVE A BETTER FEEL FOR THAT THAN WE WILL," HARBAUGH SAID. "I'M SURE THAT THAEY DIDN'T SHOW IN THE PRESEASON EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE PLANNING ON DOING." THE BRONCOS SHOWED ALMOST NOTHING IN THE PRESEASON, IN PART BECAUSE MANNING NEVER HAD PRO BOWL RECEIVERS THOMAS AND EMMANUEL SANDERS TOGETHER WITH HIM ON THE FIELD. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO USE TRAINING CAMP TO GET A FEEL FOR THE XFUTURE. GENERAL MANAGER JOHN ELWAY SAID HE LIKED WHAT HE SAW IN BROCK OSWEILER, WHO'S ENTERING HIS FOURTH SEASON AS MANNING'S BACKUP. HE ALSO LIKED ROOKIE TREVOR SIEMIAN, SO MUCH SO THAT HE HAD TOB KEEP THE FORMER NORTHWESTERN QB ON THE 53-MVAN ROSTER RATHER THAN RISK TRYING TO SLIP HIM THROUGH TO THE PRACTICE SQUAD. MANNING MADE CAMEOS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD EXHIBITION GAMES AND DIDN'T FIND THE END ZONE IN NINE FULL POSSESSIONS.  HE MADE IT QUITE APPARENT THAT HE WANTSED ME TO DO IT, AND I REALLY WANTED TO DO THE PROJECT, SO IT WBAS JUST ABOUT GETTING THE STUDIO AND EVFERYONE ON BOARD. HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PLAYED MORE AND BETTER BUT WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS PREPARATION FOR HIS 18TH NFL SEASON. HARBAUGH MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO EXPECT SUNDAY, BUT HE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF KUBIAK AND HIS TOP LIEUTENANT, RICK DENNISON, LAST YEAR, RAVENS QUARTERBACK JOE FLACCO HAD THE BEST SEASON OF HIS NSEVEN-YEAR CAREER. "I'M SURE THAT PEYTON IS HAVING A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM," FLACCO SAID. "... THEY JUST HELPED ME PLAY FAST, PLAY WITH A QUIET MIND, BE CONFIDENT AND MAKE QUICK DECISIONS.  DE SENAS ALMA MATER IS HOSTING ITS FIRST SPARTAN COLLEGE CLASSIC ON SATURDAY, WITH THE EVENT DOUBLING AS A FUNDRAISER FOR UNITED WAY OF TOMPKINS COUNTY AND CORNELL UNIVERSITY. I THINK THAT OUR LINE PLAYED REALLY WELL LAST YEAR UNDER THEIR PROTECTION SCHEME AND I THINK THAT HELPED OUT A TON." THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR MANNING, WHO HAS FOUR NEW O-LINEMEN, INCLUDING TWO NOVICES IN LEFT TACKLE TY SAMBRAILO AND CENTER MATT PARADIS. RAVENS RUNNING BACK JUSTIN FORSETT WEVNT FROM JOURNEYMAN TO PRO BOWLER IN KUBIAK'S ZONE BLOCKING SCHEME LAST YEAR, AND HARBAUGH SAID DENVER PRO BOWLER C.J. ANDERSON SHOULD BE IN FOR A SIMILARLY SPECTACULAR SEASON. "HE'S A DOWNHILL, ONE-CUT, VERY PHYSICAL GUY," HARBAUGH SAID. "DIFFERENT KINDS OF BACKS ARE GOOD IN THIS SCHEME, BUT THEY'VE GOT TWO OF THEM. RONNIE HILLMAN DOES IT DIFFERENTLY THAN C.J. DOES IT. IF THINK THEY'VE GOT TWO GUYS WITH DIFFERENT STYLES THAT RUN THE SCHEME VERY WELL."

711	-- POPE FRANCIS [JORGE MARIO BERGOGLIO, 78] ADDRESSED THE U.S. CONGRESS SEPTEMBER 24, 2015, IN HIS FIRST VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES. HE COVERED A LOT OF GROUNDS WHEN HE DISHED OUT HIS SOCIO-POLITICAL HOMILY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE TOUCHED ON SO MANY ISSUES WHICH WERE DIFFICULT FOR MANY AMERICANS TO CHEW, SWALLOW AND DIGEST. I AM SURE THERE WERE PLENTY OF THUMBS-UP FOR THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR NODS FOR THE POPE'S SERMON ON POVERTY AND FINGER-WAGGING AS WELL FOR THOSE WHO TOOK A BITE OF WHAT HE WAS PREACHING AND AESTHETICALLY IF NOT TASTEFULLY SWALLOWED IT BUT COULD NOT DIGEST. I AM PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE WHO TOOK AN OVERDOSE OF STOMACH ENZYME PILLS THAT PRIMARY-CARE PHYSICIANS PRESCRIBED FOR ACID REFLUX RELIEF WHEN I LISTENED TO POPE FRANCIS' LONG-DRAWN-OUT SPEECH IN CONGRESS BECAUSE OF INDIGESTION PROBLEM. HOWEVER, THE POPE IS ARGENTINIAN AND HARDLY SPEAKS ENGLISH, BUT THE PREPARED SCRIPT HE WAS READING IN ENGLISH, WAS FULL OF NERVE-PINCHING MESSAGES THAT WOKE UP THE SUPPOSEDLY LISTENING POLITICIANS FROM THEIR SEATS, AND IN FACT SOME OF THEM WERE ON THEIR FEET IN STANDING OVATION QUITE A FEW TIMES. FROM THE PRELATE'S PREPARED SOCIO-POLITICAL MENU, I CHOSE POVERTY TO LISTEN TO ATTENTIVELY BECAUSE IT IS HIS FAVORITE GOSPEL OF TRUTH [DIAKONIA], WHICH IN THE LAYMAN'S LANGUAGE, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH' MINISTRY OF CHARITY. THIS JUSTIFICATION OF POPE FRANCIS' CONCERNS FOR THE POOR, WHO ARE STARVING FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE ALL OVER THE WORLD, WAS IN THE "DEUS CARITAS EST" OF POPE BENEDICT XVI, HIS PREDECESSOR. POPE FRANCIS CHOSE THIS SUBJECT OF SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR THE POOR AS HIS GOSPEL OF TRUTH TO PREACH WORLDWIDE, IDENTIFYING HIMSELF "AS THE 266TH AND CURRENT POPE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, A TITLE HE HOLDS EX-OFFICIO AS BISHOP OF ROME, AND SOVEREIGN OF THE VATICAN CITY." [1] THE MEDIA DESCRIBED HIM AS THE "SLUM POPE" WHO IS "BRINGING HIS 'CHURCH OF THE POOR' TO THE WORLD'S WEALTHIEST SUPERPOWER" -- THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HE APPEALED TO THE U.S. CONGRESS TO COMBAT DESTITUTION AND NEEDINESS OF "THE PEOPLE IN THE CYCLE OF POVERTY" THAT THEY MAY BE GIVEN HOPE. AT THIS POINT OF THE POPE'S CONGRESSIONAL HOMILY, I SAY THUMBS UP FOR OUR PASSIONATE, COMPASSIONATE AND HIGHLY-ESTEEMED VISITOR, THE HOLY MAN FROM THE SACERDOTAL-MONARCHICAL VATICAN CITY OF ROME. THE FIRST DISCOMFORT THAT I ENCOUNTERED WHEN I SWALLOWED WHILE LISTENING TO POPE FRANCIS' DISCOURSE ON POVERTY WAS WHEN HE DRIFTED INTO THE SUBJECT OF CAPITALISM AND WEALTH INEQUALITY. THIS IS A VERY SENSITIVE TOPIC FOR THE LISTENING POLITICIANS IN CONGRESS TO DISCUSS OR EVEN GIGGLE OR MUMBLE A COMMENT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE POPE AT THIS TIME WHEN THE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAD UNSHEATHED THEIR SWORDS OF HOSTILITY WHILE POSITIONING FOR THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. BEFORE GOING TO CONGRESS, THE POPE AND PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HAD SOME SORT OF POW-WOW ON THIS WAR ON POVERTY. IN THE SATIRE I PUBLISHED IN THIS VENUE, I WROTE THE FOLLOWING: "OBAMA HAD THIS FRIGHTENING STORY OF EGALITARIAN WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION THAT MAKES THE RICH WET IN THEIR PANTS. AMERICAN CAPITALISTS ALWAYS FEAR THAT OBAMA WOULD TURN THE COUNTRY UPSIDE DOWN AND WITH IT OUT OF THEIR POCKET AND ARM-BAR BRAZILIAN JU-JITSU GOES THEIR FORTUNE, POWER AND CONTROL OF SOCIETY." THE UNITED STATES IS THE LEADING CAPITALIST NATION IN THE WORLD. THE WAR THAT IS GOING ON HERE NOW IS NOT A WAR AGAINST POVERTY BUT OBAMA'S WAR AGAINST CAPITALISM. AMERICANS ARE WARY ABOUT OBAMA'S CLASS WAR WHERE THE PROGRAM OF CONQUEST IS TO "LEVEL OFF THE STATUS AND SOCIAL STANDING OF ALL AMERICANS IN AMERICA WHERE THERE WILL BE NEITHER POOR NOR RICH." TO THOSE WHO SUPPORT OBAMA, A CLASSLESS SOCIETY OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF AMERICA DOES NOT SOUND SO BAD AT ALL. -- WITH THE POPE'S SOCIALISTIC ADVOCACY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S MINISTRY OF CHARITY FOR THE POOR, THE VATICAN IS IN ACCORD WITH OBAMA'S WAR ON CAPITALISM, BUT I DOUBT VERY MUCH IF HE DOES NOT SOUND DISCORDANT TO THE POWERFUL ARMY OF THE CAPITALIST RICH AND FAMOUS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT MARCH BEHIND THE REPUBLICANS IN THEIR CLASS WAR AGAINST OBAMA. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO LATE FOR THE POPE AND HIS OFFICIAL ENTOURAGE TO REALIZE THAT HE WAS STANDING IN THE PODIUM OF THE U.S. CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE MIGHTIEST AND THE WEALTHIEST CAPITALIST COUNTRY ON THE PLANET. I HATE TO HEAR ANYONE SAYING THAT IN CONGRESS, THE POPE WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. HIS EPISCOPAL MESSAGE TO OBAMA IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT QUITE PRELATIC OR PONTIFICAL WHEN IT WAS DELIVERED IN THE HALL OF CONGRESS. BUT THE MOST DISCORDANT PART OF THE POPE'S CHURCH-FOR-THE-POOR ECCLESIASTICAL SOLILOQUY IS THE VATICAN'S GREAT WEALTH ITSELF THAT CONTRADICTS ITS LITURGY. THIS CHURCH THAT CHRIST HAD CONCEIVED PRIMARILY FOR THE POOR IS NO LONGER POOR; IT IS NOW WALLOWING ON WEALTH AND EXCESSIVE RICHES. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE THAT ALL OVER THE WORLD THE CATHOLIC CHURCH [THE CHURCH] OWNS ESTATES CONSISTING OF TRACKS OF LANDS AND INVESTABLE REAL PROPERTIES, SEVERAL EXPENSIVE AND EXCLUSIVE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, RELIGIOUS BUSINESS ENTERPRISES AND STOCK INVESTMENTS THE WORTH OF IT BOGGLES THE IMAGINATION. WORLD-WIDE, THE WEALTH OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS SO VAST IT IS INCAPABLE OF MONETARY ESTIMATION. IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE, THE FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE ECONOMIST ESTIMATED $170 BILLION FOR THE CHURCH'S ANNUAL SPENDING. OUT OF THIS YEARLY SPENDING IN THE U.S., $150 BILLION WAS FOR "CHURCH-AFFILIATED HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS AND INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING" AND ONLY $11 BILLION FOR "CATHOLIC CHARITIES". [2] THIS IS ONLY WHAT THE CHURCH SPENDS A YEAR; IT DOES NOT INCLUDE WHAT THE MINISTRY PUT ASIDE AS SAVINGS AT THE END OF THE YEAR. -- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEN AND NOW IS THAT THEN "JESUS, THE FOUNDER OF CHRISTIANITY, WAS THE POOREST OF THE POOR". STRIPPED OF MATERIAL POSSESSIONS, CHRIST'S TRUE DISCIPLES OF CHRISTIANITY LIVED, WITH THEIR SELF-IMPOSED HUMILITY, ABSTINENCE AND PRIVATION, IN SECLUDED PLACES, MOST OF THEM IN ISOLATED MASSIFS AND SIERRAS AND SOME EVEN IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH HARDLY ANY CLOTH ON THEIR BACK AND FOOD IN THEIR STOMACH "SURVIVING ONLY OF CRICKETS AND WATER", SIMILAR TO HOW CHRIST LIVED HIS LIFE WITH NOTHING, "NOT EVEN A PILLOW TO SLEEP ON". [3] THIS DOES NOT MEAN OF COURSE THAT LIFE IN THE VATICAN SHOULD BE LIKE WHAT IT WAS TO THESE TRUE DISCIPLES OF CHRIST BEFORE ... SURVIVING ONLY WITH CRICKETS AND WATER AND FOR THE POPE NOT EVEN HAVING A PILLOW UNDER HIS HEAD, A LIFE OF HUMILITY, ABSTINENCE AND PRIVATION THAT TODAY IS NO LONGER PERCEIVABLE; ALL OF THESE DISAPPEARED IN TIME. TIME HAD CHANGED. BUT NOW THAT THE CHURCH HAS HUGE, COSTLY AND EXTRAVAGANT CASTLES OF WORSHIPS IN DIFFERENT AFFLUENT CITIES OF THE WORLD WITH ITS COFFER OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD AND RICHES SO TO SPEAK, ALL OF THESE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE POOR UNDER THE CHURCH'S SA

PORTO'S OPENING GROUP GAME BROUGHT A 2-2 DRAW AGAINST DYNAMO KIEV. IN THE OTHER GROUP G GAME, MACCABI TEL AVIV HOSTS DYNAMO KIEV. ---- OLD ANTAGONISTS MEET THERE COULD BE A FROSTY ATMOSPHERE AT PORTO'S ESTADIO DO DRAGAO WHEN MOURINHO AND IKER CASILLAS CROSS PATHS AGAIN. PORTO'S SPANISH GOALKEEPER MAY WELL BE BEARING A GRUDGE AGAINST THE CHELSEA COACH FROM THEIR TIME TOGETHER AT REAL MADRID. THEIR RELATIONS BECAME STRAINED IN 2012 WHEN THEN-REAL COACH MOURINHO SURPRISINGLY BENCHED THE LONGTIME SPAIN AND CLUB GOALKEEPER, CAUSING AN OUTCRY. CASILLAS, WHO MOVED TO PORTO FROM MADRID LAST SUMMER, WAS LEFT OFF REAL'S FIRST TEAM FOR FIVE MONTHS AND SAID THE EPISODE MADE HIM CRY. IT DIDN'T HURT HIS CAREER MUCH, THOUGH: HE IS POISED TO BECOME TUESDAY THE PLAYER WITH MOST CHAMPIONS LEAGUE APPEARANCES, OVERTAKING XAVI HERNANDEZ TO PLAY IN THE TOURNAMENT FOR THE 152ND TIME. MOURINHO WILL LIKELY GET ANOTHER WARM RECEPTION FROM PORTO FANS WHO REMEMBER HIM AS THE COACH WHO WON THEM THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IN 2004 THE PORTUGUESE CLUB'S SECOND EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS TROPHY. RADAMEL FALCAO, WHO PLAYED FOR PORTO FROM 2009-11, ALSO RETURNS IN CHELSEA COLORS. ---- DIFFERING FORM CHELSEA HAS STRUGGLED DOMESTICALLY THIS SEASON AND IT DREW 2-2 AGAINST TROUBLED NEWCASTLE UNITED AT THE WEEKEND. IT HAS A 2-2-3 RECORD AND HAS HALF AS MANY POINTS AS PREMIER LEAGUE LEADER MANCHESTER UNITED. WHILE THE DEFENDING ENGLISH CHAMPION'S CONFIDENCE IS DENTED, PORTO IS JOINT LEADER OF THE PORTUGUESE LEAGUE. PORTO IS UNDEFEATED IN SIX DOMESTIC GAMES AND IS ON A 12-MATCH UNBEATEN RUN IN ALL COMPETITIONS, THOUGH IT WAS SURPRISINGLY HELD TO A 2-2 DRAW BY MINNOW MOREIRENSE LAST WEEKEND. IN EUROPE, CHELSEA HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER PORTO WITH FOUR VICTORIES IN THE PREVIOUS SIX ENCOUNTERS, PORTO WINNING ONLY ONE. THE LONDON CLUB HAS WON EACH THE LAST THREE ENCOUNTERS, ALL BY A SINGLE GOAL. --- IN AND OUT (MAYBE) CHELSEA STRIKER DIEGO COSTA RECEIVED A THREE-MATCH RETROSPECTIVE BAN FOR VIOLENT CONDUCT AGAINST ARSENAL IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE BUT IS AVAILABLE FOR CHELSEA IN EUROPE AND IS EXPECTED TO LEAD THE ATTACK IN NORTHERN PORTUGAL.  ---- MACCABI'S BACK MACCABI TEL AVIV, BACK IN THE COMPETITION AFTER 11 YEARS AND HOSTING ITS FIRST CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GAME SINCE 2004, IS COMING OFF ITS FIRST WIN IN FOUR GAMES IN DOMESTIC COMPETITION.

714	SOUTH ATLANTIC PETROLEUM, AN INDIGENOUS OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY, HAS SACKED 10 OF ITS WORKERS WHO WERE ASSIGNED TO WORK ON THE SM OILFIELD, OFFSHORE THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN. THE RE-DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIELD WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED IN JUNE THIS YEAR, FOLLOWING THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE FIRST OIL ON THE FIELD. THE DISENGAGED WORKERS, SUPPORTED BY THE PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS SENIOR STAFF ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA, ON MONDAY PICKETED THE COMPANYS HEAD OFFICE IN VICTORIA ISLAND, LAGOS. THE CHAIRMAN, PENGASSAN, SAPETRO BRANCH, MR. EMMANUEL ONUORAH, TOLD OUR CORRESPONDENTS THAT THE WORKERS WERE NOT TOLD THEY WERE EMPLOYED FOR THE PROJECT BUT WERE HIRED AS REGULAR WORKERS AND SECONDED TO WORK ON THE PROJECT TO COMPLETION. HE SAID, THE RESTRUCTURING EXERCISE GOING ON AT SAPETRO, BEING DONE BY PWC, WAS A DIFFERENT THING ENTIRELY FROM THE PROJECT. IT WAS WHEN THE PROJECT FAILED AND THE MANAGEMENT DECIDED IN JUNE THIS YEAR TO CALL IT QUITS THAT THEY NOW MIXED THE TWO TOGETHER. THE RESTRUCTURING WAS EVEN SUPPOSED TO INCREASE OUR STAFF STRENGTH FROM 71 TO 100. WE DRILLED THREE WELLS CSW-1, CS 4 AND CS 5. WHEN WE STARTED DRILLING, THE RESERVES DROPPED FROM EIGHT MILLION BARRELS TO FIVE MILLION BARRELS. ONUORAH SAID OIL OF ABOUT 2,500 BARRELS PER DAY WAS FOUND IN ONE OF THE WELLS, BUT IT WAS VERY VISCOUS. SO, TO FLOW IT FROM THE PLATFORM TO ONSHORE BECAME DIFFICULT. BECAUSE OF THAT, THE COMPANY FELT IT DID NOT HAVE FUNDS AGAIN AND THE PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED, HE ADDED. THE CHAIRMAN, PENGASSAN, LAGOS ZONE, MR. ABEL AGARIN, SAID MEMBERS OF THE UNION DECIDED TO PROTEST AS RESULT OF THE COMPANYS REFUSAL TO RENEGOTIATE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE WORKERS. THE ACTING MANAGING DIRECTOR, SAPETRO, MR. DAN OGUCHE, WHILE CONVEYING THE MANAGEMENTS RESPONSE TO THE PROTEST IN A LETTER TO THE UNION, SAID, PLEASE REFER TO THE MEETING HELD BETWEEN SAPETRO MANAGEMENT AND PENGASSAN TODAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2015 AND BE ADVISED AS FOLLOWS: SAPETRO WILL RECALL THE 10 STAFF DISENGAGED ON AUGUST 31, 2015.

717	THE UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR OUTER SPACE AFFAIRS (UNOOSA) AND THE JAPAN AEROSPACE EXPLORATION AGENCY (JAXA) TODAY ANNOUNCED THE JOINT INITIATIVE "KIBOCUBE" WHICH WILL OFFER EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEPLOY CUBE SATELLITES (CUBESATS) FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS). CUBESATS ARE LOW-COST SATELLITES USING ACCESSIBLE, OFF-THE-SHELF TECHNOLOGY. THEIR APPLICATIONS INCLUDE PROJECTS FOR EDUCATION, COMMUNICATION, DISASTER RISK REDUCTION AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. THE JAPANESE EXPERIMENT MODULE "KIBO" - THE FIRST ELEMENT OF WHICH WAS DELIVERED INTO SPACE BY UNITED NATIONS EXPERT ON SPACE APPLICATIONS AND VETERAN ASTRONAUT, TAKAO DOI - HAS BEEN OPERATING ON THE ISS SINCE 2008. KIBO'S UNIQUE CAPABILITY PERMITS CUBESATS TO BE DEPLOYED FROM SPACE, THROUGH USE OF AN AIRLOCK SYSTEM AND ROBOTIC ARM. THE AGREEMENT ANNOUNCED TODAY WILL ENABLE UNOOSA AND JAXA TO HARNESS KIBO'S CAPABILITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF DEVELOPING NATIONS. THROUGH THIS LATEST EXAMPLE OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN SPACE, COUNTRIES WITHOUT THEIR OWN CAPABILITY TO LAUNCH SATELLITES WILL NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME BE ABLE TO DEPLOY SATELLITES BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. SIMONETTA DI PIPPO, DIRECTOR OF UNOOSA, SAID: "BY OFFERING THIS UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY, UNOOSA AND JAXA ARE RAISING AWARENESS OF THE ROLE THAT SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PLAYS IN PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CONTRIBUTING TO BUILDING NATIONAL CAPACITIES IN SPACECRAFT ENGINEERING, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, THUS BUILDING SPACE ECONOMIES IN DEVELOPING NATIONS." HAKUBUN SHIMOMURA, JAPANESE MINISTER OF EDUCATION, CULTURE, SPORTS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SAID: "KIBOCUBE IS AN UNPRECEDENTED PROGRAMME IN WHICH JAPAN AND THE UNITED NATIONS JOINTLY PROVIDE DEVELOPING NATIONS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEPLOY CUBESATS FROM KIBO, AND I AM PLEASED THAT JAPAN WILL BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE, THROUGH THIS JOINT PROGRAMME, TO OPENING UP NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN SPACE ENVIRONMENT UTILIZATION AND TO BENEFITING MORE COUNTRIES FROM THE UNIQUE PLATFORM OF KIBO." UNOOSA PROMOTES GREATER INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR PEACEFUL PURPOSES, IN PARTICULAR, FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE OFFICE SERVES TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF ALL NATIONS TO ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS TO SPACE AND ITS FULL USE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
718	IT WAS ANNOUNCED DURING THE SUMMERSLAM PAY-PER-VIEW A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT BROCK LESNAR WILL BE COMPETING AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN ON OCTOBER 3RD AS PART OF A WWE NETWORK SPECIAL. EVER SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF SPECULATION AS TO WHO THE BEAST COULD BE FACING AS HE DESCENDS UPON ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ARENAS IN THE WORLD FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WRESTLEMANIA 20, BUT IT SEEMS THAT WWE HAVE FINALLY REVEALED A GIANT OPPONENT FOR HIM. RETIREMENT MATCH? THE BIG SHOW HAS BEEN UNVEILED AS THE MAN WHO WILL TAKE ON THE HUMAN SUPLEX MACHINE IN NEW YORK CITY NEXT MONTH. BUT THE REAL QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS WILL BE BIG SHOW'S LAST MATCH. SIGN UP NOW WANT TO BECOME A GMS WRITER? SIGN UP NOW AND SUBMIT A 250 WORD TEST ARTICLE: HTTP://GMS.TO/HAVEYOURSAY4 LATELY BIG SHOW HAS BEEN REACTING TO THE WWE UNIVERSE'S CHANTS OF "PLEASE RETIRE" BY TELLING THEM TO FIND SOMEONE WORTHY OF RETIRING HIM BECAUSE WWE HAS NO ONE DESERVING OF THAT ACCOLADE. WHO BETTER THAN BROCK LESNAR TO DO THE HONORS? BIG SHOW HASN'T DONE A LOT IN WWE AS OF LATE AND SINCE HE LEFT THE AUTHORITY HE HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH SURPLUS TO REQUIREMENTS ON THE MAIN ROSTER. HE WAS NEVER REALLY A CREDIBLE CHALLENGE TO RYBACK'S INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP REIGN SO IT IS STILL YET TO BE MADE APPARENT AS TO WHY THEY ARE STILL IN A RIVALRY. HE FACED "THE BIG GUY" AGAIN ON MONDAY NIGHT RAW AND ONCE AGAIN HE WAS DEFEATED IN A TITLE MATCH. IT'S SAD TO SEE HOW LOW BIG SHOW HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO FALL OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS BUT IT SEEMS THIS COULD BE A CREDIBLE WAY TO ALLOW "THE WORLD'S LARGEST ATHLETE" TO FINALLY BOW OUT. NETWORK SPECIAL ALLOWING BIG SHOW TO BOW OUT IN A NETWORK SPECIAL DOES SEEM HARSH, BUT GIVEN THE RIGHT PROMOTION AND BUILD UP AND WWE COULD NOT ONLY MAKE THIS A CELEBRATION OF BROCK LESNAR BUT THEY COULD ALSO MAKE IT A DECENT RETIREMENT PARTY FOR BIG SHOW. THE BEAST IN THE EAST WAS A NETWORK SPECIAL AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THE BETTER PAY-PER-VIEWS OF THE YEAR WITH MILLIONS TUNING IN TO WATCH LIVE AT 5AM IN AMERICA. IF THIS EVENT IS GIVEN A BIG ENOUGH BUILD THEN MANY WILL TUNE IN TO WATCH THIS ALSO. THE THOUGHT NOW IS THAT YET AGAIN BIG SHOW WILL FIGHT FOR THE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP AT NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS BEFORE THERE IS SOME PREPARATION FOR THIS MATCH. WHETHER OR NOT THE BUILD WILL BE PART OF RAW OR SMACKDOWN STILL REMAINS TO BE SEEN. IF BROCK LESNAR ISN'T THE GUY TO RETIRE BIG SHOW THEN WHO IS?

721	CURRENT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS WAVES AFTER SPEAKING AT A REPUBLICAN VICTORY PARTY IN AUSTIN, TEXAS. IN TEA PARTY FRIENDLY TEXAS, NO POLITICAL STAR HAS BURNED BRIGHTER IN RECENT YEARS THAN TED CRUZ. HE RODE A GRASSROOTS GROUNDSWELL TO AN UPSET SENATE VICTORY IN 2012, FURTHER SOLIDIFIED HIS CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALS BY HELPING LEAD A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND HAS BUILT HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AROUND WOOING THE REPUBLICAN PARTYS FAR RIGHT WING. BUT CRUZ MAY SOON BE FINDING HIMSELF DEFENDING HIS HOME TURF. SEPTEMBER 01, 2015 HE RODE A GRASSROOTS GROUNDSWELL TO AN UPSET SENATE VICTORY IN 2012, FURTHER SOLIDIFIED HIS CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALS BY HELPING LEAD A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND HAS BUILT HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AROUND WOOING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S FAR RIGHT WING. BUT CRUZ MAY SOON BE FINDING HIMSELF DEFENDING HIS HOME TURF. THE FIRST-TERM SENATOR ADDRESSED A HOMETOWN CROWD IN HOUSTON ON TUESDAY AND WILL HOLD THREE CAMPAIGN EVENTS STATEWIDE THURSDAY ALTOGETHER HIS FIRST PUBLIC TEXAS VISITS SINCE A PRE-JULY 4 TOUR FOR HIS NEW BOOK. HE'S COMING BACK JUST AS DONALD TRUMP HAS SHOT TO THE TOP OF STATEWIDE POLLS, MIRRORING A NATIONAL RISE. OTHER RIVALS, JEB BUSH AND SCOTT WALKER AMONG THEM, HAVE COME TO TEXAS MORE FREQUENTLY OR AT LEAST MORE RECENTLY. THEY ARE MOUNTING A CHALLENGE TO CRUZ THAT HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO COME FROM HOME-STATE RIVAL RICK PERRY, THE FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR WHO INSTEAD IS BARELY MAKING AN IMPACT IN THE STATE. FOR CRUZ, SAID AUSTIN-BASED REPUBLICAN CONSULTANT MATT MACKOWIAK, "TEXAS IS NOT A GUARANTEE." CRUZ WILL HOLD A RALLY IN FORT WORTH ON THURSDAY AND TEA PARTY EVENTS IN TYLER AND BACK IN HOUSTON. HIS WIFE, HEIDI, ADDRESSED A SAN ANTONIO CROWD RECENTLY. CRUZ RELISHES BEING A POLITICAL INSURGENT. BUT SINCE TRUMP HAS CRANKED UP THE CAMPAIGN'S OUTLANDISHNESS, PRIMARY VOTERS WHO MIGHT HAVE LOOKED TO CRUZ TO SHAKE UP THE STATUS QUO COULD GRAVITATE TO HIS REALITY-TV STAR COMPETITOR. "NOBODY WILL OUTWORK TED ON THE GROUND," SAID JOANN FLEMING, CRUZ'S TEXAS TEA PARTY CHAIRWOMAN AND ORGANIZER OF THE TYLER EVENT. BUT FLEMING ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED TRUMP'S APPEAL. "THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT CREATED A DONALD TRUMP-SIZE VACUUM," SHE SAID, "BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAILED TO DO ANYTHING THEY PROMISED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEY WOULD DO." CRUZ HAS BEEN CONSPICUOUSLY CAREFUL NOT TO CRITICIZE TRUMP. INDEED, HE PLANS TO APPEAR WITH HIM AT A CAPITOL HILL RALLY AGAINST THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN. BUT TRUMP'S ASCENSION IN TEXAS HASN'T GONE UNNOTICED. "IT'D BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR (CRUZ) TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE OF OTHER STATES HOW HE SHOULD BE THE NOMINEE IF HIS HOMETOWN REPUBLICANS DON'T GIVE HIM A FIRST-PLACE FINISH," SAID FORMER TEXAS REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIRMAN STEVE MUNISTERI, WHO LEFT HIS POST TO WORK FOR RAND PAUL'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. CRUZ SPOKESWOMAN CATHERINE FRAZIER SHRUGGED OFF SUGGESTIONS CRUZ HAS TO SHORE UP HIS TEXAS FLANK. SHE SAID THE HOME-STATE SWING WAS PLANNED BEFORE TRUMP'S SURGE IN POLLING: "WE'RE FOCUSED ON OUR OWN CAMPAIGN." CRUZ SAYS HE'S BUILDING A CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE AND GRASSROOTS SUPPORT IN AREAS WITH PRIMARIES BEYOND THE STATES THAT OPEN PRESIDENTIAL VOTING: IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA. THAT'S WHY HE TOURED THE SOUTH BY BUS AND VISITED STATES SUCH AS WYOMING. TEXAS MOVED UP ITS PRIMARY TO MARCH 1, MEANING IT WILL VOTE RIGHT AFTER THE OPENING THREE STATES AND NEVADA. IT'S NOW ONE OF 12 STATES IN THE "SEC PRIMARY," SO DUBBED BECAUSE MANY HAVE COLLEGE TEAMS IN THE NCAA'S SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE. BUT WITH 150-PLUS DELEGATES AT STAKE, TEXAS IS THE BIGGEST PRIZE, THOUGH IT WON'T BE WINNER-TAKE-ALL. CRUZ "WILL RARELY BE IN TEXAS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE," FLEMING WARNED SUPPORTERS IN AN INVITATION TO THE TYLER EVENT. "HE HAS 49 OTHER STATES TO VISIT." BEFORE THE RACE BEGAN, TEXAS LOOKED TO BE A CRUZ-PERRY SHOWDOWN. BUT PERRY HAS STRUGGLED SINCE LEAVING OFFICE IN JANUARY AS THE LONGEST-SERVING GOVERNOR IN STATE HISTORY. MOST FOCUSED ON IOWA, PERRY HASN'T HELD TEXAS CAMPAIGN EVENTS SINCE ENTERING THE RACE IN JUNE. CRUZ'S CAMPAIGN RAISED ABOUT $6 MILLION IN TEXAS THROUGH JUNE, COMPARED WITH LESS THAN $700,000 FOR PERRY, ACCORDING TO FEDERAL ELECTIONS COMMISSION DATA. BUSH, WHO WAS BORN IN THE WEST TEXAS OIL PATCH AND WHOSE SON GEORGE P. IS THE STATE'S LAND COMMISSIONER, GOT MORE THAN $1 MILLION FROM TEXAS DONORS. BUSH, THE FLORIDA GOVERNOR, ALSO CAMPAIGNED ON THE TEXAS-MEXICO BORDER LAST WEEK AND USED HIS FLUENT SPANISH, WHICH CRUZ DOESN'T SPEAK, THOUGH HIS FATHER'S FROM CUBA. WALKER, THE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR, IS COMING THIS WEEK FOR FUNDRAISING AND POLITICAL EVENTS IN DALLAS, SAN ANTONIO AND MIDLAND IN WEST TEXAS. HE'S "NOT CEDING ANYTHING TO ANYONE IN TEXAS," SAID SPOKESWOMAN KIRSTEN KUKOWSKI. HE ALSO VISITED THE MEXICO BORDER, IN MARCH, WITH TEXAS GOV. GREG ABBOTT, WHO DIDN'T PARTICIPATE WHEN CRUZ, TRUMP OR BUSH TOURED THE BORDER. PAUL, A KENTUCKY SENATOR, CAMPAIGNED IN TEXAS IN JULY AND GOT HELP FROM RELATIVES HIS FATHER WAS A LONGTIME TEXAS CONGRESSMAN. MACKOWIAK, THE GOP OPERATIVE, SAID THE CHALLENGE FOR CRUZ'S CAMPAIGN IS TO WIN THE MOST TEXAS DELEGATES POSSIBLE WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE TIME OR MONEY THAN NECESSARY. "THEY NEED THAT MONEY AND THAT TIME TO SPEND ON THE OTHER STATES," MACKOWIAK SAID, "WHERE HE'S LESS WELL-KNOWN." SUBJECTS PEOPLE LOCATIONS ORGANISATIONS

723	THAT GAME YOU USED TO PLAY IS GETTING A FULL-LENGTH FEATURE AND THE TRAILER GIVES US A FIRST LOOK AT FAVOURITE CHARACTERS LIKE NAMELESS RED BIRD AND BLACK BLOWY-UP BIRD ANGRY BIRDS IS THE RED-HOT IPHONE APP OF THE MOMENT. ITS LITERALLY A ONE-IN-A-MILLION SENSATION. YOUR FRIENDS CANT STOP PLAYING IT. THE WORLDS EDGIEST COMEDIANS CANT STOP REFERENCING IT AND NOW ITS HEADING TO THE BIG SCREEN! WHAT SORT OF BLOCKBUS OH, HANG ON, MY FAULT, SORRY. I THOUGHT IT WAS 2012. LET ME START AGAIN. ANGRY BIRDS IS THAT IPHONE GAME THAT PEOPLE USED TO PLAY A LOT THREE YEARS AGO BUT DONT ANY MORE. AND NOW ITS GOING TO BE A FILM. AND THERES A TRAILER FOR IT. THERE, THATS BETTER. STILL, WHILE WERE HERE, LETS GIVE THE ANGRY BIRDS TRAILER A CLOSER LOOK. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST WE OPEN WITH A SHOT OF THE CHARACTER WERE MOST LIKELY TO REMEMBER FROM THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED ANGRY BIRDS SEVERAL YEARS AGO NAMELESS RED BIRD. HERES NAMELESS RED BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. SO FAR, THIS IS A FILM ABOUT A CARTOON BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST ALSO PRESENT, THREE SEXY BIRDS. AT LEAST I ASSUME THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY. GOD, I HOPE THEY ARE, OTHERWISE IVE JUST PROJECTING A HORRIFIC AMOUNT OF SEXUAL AVAILABILITY ONTO THREE RELATIVELY GENDER-FREE CARTOON BIRDS. NOT THIS WEEK, HERITAGE. DONT DO THIS WHILE NEBULOUS ALMOST-BESTIALITY IS SUCH A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE. GET IT TOGETHER. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, PHEW, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY AFTER ALL. AND THEY WERE AIMING ALL THEIR RED-HOT SEXUALITY AT THAT HUNKY SORT-OF BLUEISH BIRD. I HOPE THE RED BIRDS OK, AND DIDNT MISTAKENLY THINK THE OTHER BIRDS WERE ACTUALLY COMING ON TO HIM. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST AH. HE DID. AND BY THE LOOK OF IT HE HASNT TAKEN THE REJECTION WELL. IN FACT, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT HES NOW A FAIRLY ANGRY BIRD. SEE WHAT I DID THERE? THAT WAS CLEVER OF ME WASNT IT? SO ANGRY IS NAMELESS RED BIRD, IN FACT, THAT HE APPEARS TO HAVE ENROLLED IN SOME SORT OF ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME, ALONG WITH AN ANNOYING YELLOW BIRD PLAYED BY THE ANNOYING MAN WHO PLAYED THE ANNOYING SNOWMAN IN FROZEN. TYPECASTING ISSUES ASIDE, THOUGH, THIS LITERALLY SEEMS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE A FILM ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. THATS LITERALLY WHAT THIS FILM IS. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR THE BLACK BLOWY-UP UP BIRD IS ALSO ANGRY, BECAUSE HES JUST BLOWN UP. WOW, THESE PEOPLE HAVE REALLY GRABBED THE WHOLE ANGRY BIRDS IDEA BY ITS MOST LITERAL END AND RUN WITH IT, HAVENT THEY? FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST BUT ITS OK, BECAUSE HERES A PIG, WHICH YOU MIGHT REMEMBER IS THE MORTAL ENEMY OF THE ANGRY BIRDS. PRETTY SOON THESE PIGS WILL BE CONSTRUCTING DANGEROUSLY RAMSHACKLE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES, AND THE BIRDS WILL KAMIKAZE INTO THEM AS REVENGE. IF MY MEMORY IS CORRECT, THE BIRDS ALL DIE AS SOON AS THEYVE BEEN CATAPULTED AT THE PIGS, WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE WILL ACTUALLY TURN UP TO BE A SORROWFUL MEDITATION ON THE FUTILITY OF WAR. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, WRONG AGAIN. ITS JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE IS LITERALLY JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME BIRDS WHO GET ANGRY SOMETIMES. HOPEFULLY CLEAR FLAWS WILL ALL BE ADDRESSED ADDRESSED AND IRONED OUT BY THE TIME THEY MAKE A FILM ABOUT YOUR SECOND-FAVOURITE IPHONE APP, GOOGLE MAPS.
724	STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS SAID FRIDAY THAT THEY WILL TURN OVER TO HOUSE INVESTIGATORS A NEW BATCH OF FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON S EMAILS RELATED TO BENGHAZI THAT WERE DISCOVERED AFTER A MORE THOROUGH REVIEW. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED THAT IT HAD TURNED OVER ALL THE EMAIL DIRECTLY RELATED BENGHAZI BY MRS. CLINTON , WHO USED A PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNT AND PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER FOR ALL OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE WHILE IN OFFICE, SHIELDING THE RECORDS FROM REVIEW FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER SHE LEFT OFFICE. A SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SAID ABOUT 925 EMAILS OF DISCUSSIONS THAT RELATE OR REFER TO LIBYA WOULD BE DELIVERED TO THE COMMITTEE, EXPLAINING THAT THE NEW EMAIL WERE DISCOVERED DURING A SECOND REVIEW OF THE EMAIL THE ROUGHLY 35,000 EMAILS THAT MRS. CLINTON TURNED OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT EARLIER THIS YEAR. SEE ALSO: HILLARY CLINTON PERSONALLY SIGNED DEAL THAT LET TOP AIDE COLLECT TWO SALARIES THE STATE DEPARTMENT UNDERTOOK ANOTHER REVIEW OF THE EMAIL TO ENSURE ALL BENGHAZI -RELATED MATERIAL WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE PRIOR TO THE HEARING NEXT MONTH, SAID THE OFFICIAL. THE STATE DEPARTMENT , WHICH HAS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH MULTIPLE BENGHAZI COMMITTEE REQUESTS AND FAILED TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH, IS NOW INDICATING IT INTENDS TO FOSTER A MORE COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMITTEE, SAID JAMAL D. WARE, SPOKESMAN FOR THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON BENGHAZI. ITS CURIOUS THE DEPARTMENT IS SUDDENLY ABLE TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AFTER RECENT STAFF CHANGES INVOLVING THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOCUMENT PRODUCTION. HE SAID THE COMMITTEE HAD NOT YET RECEIVED THE NEW EMAILS FRIDAY AFTERNOON. IF INDEED THIS IS A SIGN THE STONEWALLING AND POLITICAL PROTECTION EFFORT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY BEING RUN BY THE DEPARTMENT IS DIMINISHING, THE COMMITTEE WELCOMES IT. THE PROOF WILL BE IN THE PRODUCTION, MR. WARE SAID. MRS. CLINTON , WHO IS A LEADING CANDIDATE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION, IS SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE NEXT MONTH. MRS. CLINTON S UNUSUAL EMAIL SETUP AS SECRETARY OF STATE ONLY CAME TO LIGHT AFTER THE BENGHAZI COMMITTEE PRESSED THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO PRODUCE THE EMAIL, PROMPTING MRS. CLINTON TO TURN OVER HER EMAIL TO THE DEPARTMENT MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER SHE LEFT OFFICE. THE COMMITTEE IS INVESTIGATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE SEPT. 11, 2012 TERROR ATTACK ON A U.S. DIPLOMATIC COMPOUND IN BENGHAZI , LIBYA, WHICH KILLED U.S. AMBASSADOR J. CHRISTOPHER STEVENS AND THREE OTHER AMERICANS. THE DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TODAY DO NOT ALTER THE FUNDAMENTAL FACTS KNOWN ABOUT THE BENGHAZI ATTACKS, SAID THE SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL, WHO ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED. THE OFFICIAL DESCRIBED THE DISCOVERY OF THE NEW EMAIL THIS WAY: FOLLOWING OUR SECOND REVIEW OF FORMER SECRETARY CLINTON S EMAILS IN RECENT WEEKS, THE DEPARTMENT IS PRODUCING A SMALL NUMBER OF EMAILS RELATING TO BENGHAZI INCLUDING A FEW THAT WERE MISSED IN THE INITIAL HAND-REVIEW DONE IN PAPER FORM EARLY THIS YEAR AS WELL AS SOME THAT WERE SUBSTANTIALLY PERSONAL IN NATURE BUT REFERENCE BENGHAZI (AS WERE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED TO THE COMMITTEE IN AN APRIL LETTER). THE REVIEW BY DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES TO PRODUCE THE 296 DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE IN FEBRUARY WAS DONE IN PAPER FORM, BY HAND AND WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF SEARCH FUNCTIONS. THE RECENT REVIEW OF THOSE EMAILS WAS DONE ELECTRONICALLY AS THOSE EMAILS HAVE SINCE BEEN SCANNED INTO THE DEPARTMENT S SYSTEMS. THOUGH MRS. CLINTON INSISTS THAT SHE DID NOTHING WRONG, QUESTIONS ABOUT HER EMAIL AS SECRETARY OF STATE HAVE DOGGED HER CAMPAIGN, UNDERMINED VOTERS CONFIDENCE IN HER HONESTY AND LED TO AN FBI INVESTIGATION OF HER HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL THAT CONCEIVABLY COULD LEAD TO CRIMINAL CHARGES. AS THE NEW BENGHAZI EMAIL SURFACED, THE PENTAGON DISCOVERED ANOTHER STRING OF MRS. CLINTON S EMAIL FROM HER TIME IN OFFICE THAT SHE FAILED TO DISCLOSE WHEN SHE CLAIMED TO HAVE TURNED OVER ALL HER WORK-RELATED EMAIL EARLIER THIS YEAR.

726	CATERHAM PHOTOGRAPHER 'CHASING THE PERFECT PICTURE' TALKS ABOUT HER CAREER CAPTURING ARTISTS ON TOUR 16:48, 22 SEP 2015 UPDATED 16:49, 22 SEP 2015 BY AMANIHUGHES, CHRISTIE GOODWIN HAS BEEN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS SINCE THE AGE OF 12 AND HAS BUILT UP AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY CAPTURING TOP RECORDING ARTISTS ON TOUR VIEW GALLERY FROM THE LIKES OF KATY PERRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND ONE DIRECTION, THIS PHOTOGRAPHER FROM CATERHAM HAS CAPTURED A HEAP OF FAMOUS NAMES AND IS CONTINUING HER SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT PICTURE. CHRISTIE GOODWIN, A BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHER, WHOSE CAREER SPANS MORE THAN 35 YEARS, STARTED TAKING PICTURES AT THE AGE OF 12 AND WAS BOUGHT HER FIRST CAMERA AT 13. SHE GRADUATED FROM THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS IN ANTWERP AND GOT HER FIRST JOB IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY, EVOLVING TOWARDS EDITORIAL AND WORKING FOR NEWS AGENCIES BEFORE ENDING UP IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND TAKING PICTURES OF ARTISTS ON TOUR. CHRISTIE'S PORTFOLIO IS A WHO'S WHO OF TOP NAMES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, INCLUDING KATY PERRY, ED SHEERAN, USHER, TAYLOR SWIFT, ONE DIRECTION, SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY AND KYLIE MINOGUE, AMONG MANY OTHERS. SHE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME ON TOUR CAPTURING IMAGES OF ARTISTS WHICH APPEAR ON CDS, DVDS, TOUR MERCHANDISE, POSTERS, INTERNATIONAL PUBLICATIONS, BOOKS AND EXHIBITIONS. EVEN THOUGH CHRISTIE HAS BEEN ON TOUR WITH MANY ARTISTS SHE ADMITTED SHE IS STILL ON THE HUNT FOR THE ELUSIVE PERFECT PICTURE. THE THING I HAVE BEEN CHASING IS THE PERFECT PICTURE, IT KEEPS ME GOING, TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT, CHRISTIE SAID. PHOTOGRAPHY IS BASICALLY ONE MOMENT IN TIME AND YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL TO OTHERS, THAT'S WHY YOU CAPTURE IT, TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE WHAT YOU FELT AND WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED. I WANT TO CAPTURE THAT MOMENT IN TIME, IF I SHOOT A SHOW I WANT THE VIEWER TO FEEL LIKE THEY WERE THERE, THAT WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT A PICTURE THEY FEEL THE MUSIC AND FEEL THE CROWD. THAT'S WHAT I AIM FOR IN MY PHOTOGRAPHY. @CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE GOODWIN CHRISTIE EXPLAINED OUT OF ALL THE TOURS SHE HAS CAPTURED, KATY PERRY'S PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR WAS THE MOST EXCITING. I STARTED DOING THE REHEARSALS SO I ACTUALLY SAW THE SHOW BUILD UP TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE END, I SPEND TWO TO THREE WEEKS ON THE SHOW. IT WAS REALLY EXCITING TO SEE HOW SOMETHING COMES TO LIFE. THROUGHOUT HER ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER CHRISTIE HAS CAPTURED SOME POWERFUL IMAGES, FROM BB KING AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL TO SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY STRUMMING A GUITAR. HOWEVER SHE EXPLAINED HER FAVOURITE MOMENT TAKEN SO FAR WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF KATY PERRY DURING HER PRISMATIC WORLD TOUR. AN IMAGE WHICH IS NOW ICONIC AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD TO PUBLICISE THE TOUR. IN THE SHOW IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE FIREWORKS WERE BEHIND HER, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN, CHRISTIE SAID. THE MOMENT THE FIREWORKS GO, YOU GET TO SHOOT THREE FRAMES, SHE DIDN'T HAVE HER HEAD AROUND, THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE FIREWORKS. THAT FRAME HAS MADE HISTORY AND HAS BEEN USED ALL OVER THE WORLD, IT WAS A LUCKY SHOT AND I WAS HAPPY THAT WE GOT IT. ALWAYS ON THE MOVE EVEN THOUGH PHOTOGRAPHING FAMOUS ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS SOUNDS EXCITING AND CONSTANTLY DIFFERENT, CHRISTIE ASSURED IT WAS NOT ALWAYS GLAMOROUS, AS YOU ARE ALWAYS ON THE MOVE AND NEVER IN ONE PLACE FOR VERY LONG. WHEN YOU DO NOT TRAVEL, IT'S VERY EXCITING BUT WHEN YOU TRAVEL ALL THE TIME, LITTLE THINGS START TO BOTHER YOU, YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR LAUNDRY AND YOU ARE NOT IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG TIME, IT'S A DRAG. HOWEVER IN CONTRAST TO THIS CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE EASILY GETS BORED AND ITCHY FEET WHEN SHE COMES HOME TO CATERHAM AND IS EAGER TO GET OFF TO HER NEXT DESTINATION AND NEXT TOUR. THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS I DO ENJOY, YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES, SLEEP IN YOUR OWN BED, BUT AFTER THREE DAYS I WANT TO GO AGAIN, I GET BORED. WHEN I AM ON THE ROAD, I WANT TO BE BACK AT HOME AND WHEN I'M HOME I WANT TO BE ON THE ROAD. I CANNOT LIVE AT HOME, I WOULD GET BORED, BUT YOU ALSO CANNOT BE ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME, I NEED A COMBINATION OF THE TWO. WHEN ASKED IF SHE COULD IMAGINE HER LIFE TAKING A DIFFERENT PATH, CHRISTIE EXPLAINED SHE COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED DOING ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN PHOTOGRAPHY. I COULD NOT BE ANYTHING ELSE, WHEN I PICK UP A CAMERA, IT'S JUST ME AND THE CAMERA, IT'S PART OF ME, IT'S WHO I AM, I CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT THE CAMERA. TAKE PHOTOS LIKE A PRO CHRISTIE HAS TEAMED UP WITH CURRYS PC WORLD TO HELP MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR CAMERA EQUIPMENT AND PROVIDES HER TOP TIPS ON HOW TO CAPTURE PHOTOGRAPHS AT FESTIVALS, FROM TAKING THE PERFECT FESTIVAL SELFIE, LOOKING TO NAVIGATE OBSTRUCTIVE CROWDS OR CAPTURING FAST-MOVING STAGE ACTION. PLAN AHEAD: LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE, KNOW WHICH ARTISTS YOU WANT TO SHOOT, AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT IF YOU WISH TO PHOTOGRAPH BANDS ON DIFFERENT STAGES, YOU NEED TO GET THERE IN TIME. ALSO PREPARE FOR THE FACT THAT THEY MIGHT NOT START EXACTLY WHEN THEYRE SUPPOSED TO. I ALWAYS CARRY MY OWN FESTIVAL SCHEDULE ON MY PHONE. SHOOTING MY FIRST BIG FESTIVAL EARLY ON IN MY CAREER, I NEARLY MISSED AC/DC, BECAUSE I WASNT PREPARED! BE PREPARED: MAKE SURE YOU BRING ENOUGH MEMORY CARDS AND BATTERY POWER TO LAST ALL THE WAY. CHANCES ARE YOU WONT HAVE ANYWHERE TO CHARGE THEM FOR HOURS AND YOU DONT WANT TO RUN OUT JUST BEFORE YOUR FAVOURITE BAND IS ON. KEEP THEM IN A LITTLE POUCH WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES AND MAKE SURE ITS WATERPROOF, SO YOU DONT BECOME VICTIM TO FAILING CAMERA EQUIPMENT. COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS: FESTIVAL STAGES CAN BE QUITE MESSY AND CLUTTERY, SO TAKE THE TIME TO COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS. LOOK FOR ANGLES WHERE YOU CAN AVOID PEOPLE OR OBJECTS THAT WILL MAKE THE PHOTO LOOK A MESS. FESTIVAL STAGES CAN ALSO BE VERY HIGH, ESPECIALLY THE MAIN STAGE, SO IT CAN EVEN BE A CHALLENGE FOR US PROS IN THE PHOTO PIT IN FRONT OF THE STAGE. BUT MAKE SURE YOU WAIT FOR THOSE MOMENTS WHEN YOUR FAVOURITE SINGER IS RIGHT AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE THATS WHERE YOU GET YOUR BEST SHOTS. REMEMBER THE CROWD: SOME OF MY BEST SHOTS ARE NOT OF THE ARTISTS BUT OF PEOPLE IN THE CROWD. THE CROWD OFTEN MORE ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE AND CAN BRING TO LIFE THAT FEELING YOU GET BEING AT A FESTIVAL. THE GO PRO HERO 4 OR EE 4GEE ACTION CAM ARE GREAT FOR THIS KIND OF SHOT DUE TO THEIR ULTRA-WIDE ANGLE LENSES FOR A UNIQUE CROWD VIEW. WHEN YOU DO THIS, TRY TO HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER OR EVEN LOWER, PLAY WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES. MAKE SURE TO ALSO TAKE AT LEAST ONE LONG WALK AROUND THE WHOLE FESTIVAL GROUND TO HELP YOU FIND THE PERFECT SUBJECTS. MIND THE RAIN: FESTIVALS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR EVER-CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS. PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEOPLE IN THE MUD ARE TOKEN FESTIVAL SHOTS. HAVING RAIN VISIBLE IN THE SHOT CAN ADD SOMETHING INTERESTING, SO DONT TAKE IT AS A BAD THING. I NEVER GO TO A FESTIVAL WITHOUT A PLASTIC BAG TO PROTECT MY GEAR, AND HAVING A WATERPROOF CASE OR AN ACTUAL WATERPROOF CAMERA LIKE THE FUJIFILM XP80 CAN HELP TO CATER FOR ANY WEATHER CHANGE. CONSIDER YOUR LENSES: CHANGING LENSES IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD CAN BE A NIGHTMARE. DUST, MUD, THE BOOTS OF A CROWDSURFER AND AN AIRBOURNE CUP OF BEER HAVE A WAY OF FINDING YOU THE TIME YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LENS. PRACTICE CHANGING THE LENS UNDER A PLASTIC BAG OR UNDER YOUR JACKET. BECOME A FESTIVAL SELFIE KING OR QUEEN: IF YOURE GOING TO TAKE A SELFIE, MAKE SURE THE SELFIE TELLS A STORY. YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE OF YOURSELF, OR YOU CAN TAKE A FEW EXTRA SECONDS AND FRAME THAT SELFIE A LITTLE BETTER, GET SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THE SHOT, OR SOMETHING ANNOYING OUT OF IT. TAKE YOUR TIME, LOOK AROUND, AND MAYBE HOLD YOUR CAMERA A BIT HIGHER SO THAT YOU HAVE THE WHOLE FESTIVAL IN THE BACKGROUND. IF YOU TAKE A LOT OF SELFIES, THE COMPACT PANASONIC TZ57 HAS A SELFIE SCREEN AND WI-FI SO YOU CAN POST IT ON THE WEB IMMEDIATELY. THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT: WHEN YOU TAKE PHOTOS OF YOUR FRIENDS, OR WHEN YOU TAKE SELFIES, TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT THE LIGHT. IF THE SUN IS BEHIND THE PERSON IN THE PHOTO, THEIR FACE WILL BE DARKER. ITS NOT A BAD IDEA TO USE A FLASH IF YOURE SHOOTING AGAINST THE LIGHT, EVEN ON A SUNNY DAY. OR DO THE OPPOSITE, SHOOT AGAINST THE LIGHT AND PLAY WITH DARK SILHOUETTES. YOU DONT NEED A PRO CAMERA TO GET AN AMAZING SHOT LIKE THAT. TAKE IN THE VIEW: IT CAN BE REALLY FUN TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT LENSES. A FISH-EYE OR WIDE-ANGLE LENS CAN REALLY HELP CAPTURE THE SCALE OF THE FESTIVAL. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO HAVE FUN. A FISH-EYE IS A PRIME LENS, MEANING THAT YOU CANT ZOOM IN OR OUT WITH IT. THEREFORE, ITS UP TO YOU TO ACT AS THE ZOOM FOR THE LENS. BE SURE TO CHANGE PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT ANGLES AND LINES. GET DOWN LOW TO THE GROUND, EVEN IF IT MEANS LAYING ON YOUR STOMACH IN WHATS LEFT OF THE FESTIVAL GRASS. LEAN UP AGAINST A WALL AND USE THE DISTORTION OF THE LENS TO WRAP THE WALL AROUND THE FRAME. JUST HAVE FUN! BE AWARE THAT IF YOU FRAME A CLOSE UP OF A PERSON NEAR THE OUTER EDGES OF A WIDE ANGLE OR FISH-EYE SHOT, THEIR FACE CAN BE STRETCHED OUT. KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT: THIS ONE IS CRUCIAL. GETTING A NEW CAMERA WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT FEATURES IS TEMPTING, BUT MAKE SURE YOU LEARN HOW TO USE THEM. WALK THROUGH THE MANUAL GUIDE AND TEST IT ALL OUT. IT MIGHT SEEM A BIT TEDIOUS TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE STEPS BUT EVEN THE PRO PHOTOGRAPHER TAKES HIS TIME TO LEARN TO KNOW THEIR CAMERA. ONCE YOU KNOW ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF YOUR CAMERA AND HOW TO USE THEM THEN THERE IS NOTHING STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND THAT PERFECT SHOT. CHRISTIE ADDED TO TAKE MANY PHOTOS, AS IT IS THE VOLUME THAT MATTERS AND GET TO KNOW YOUR CAMERA. DO NOT SHOOT ON THE AUTOMATIC, PUT YOUR CAMERA ON MANUAL AND TEST IT OUT, YOU CANNOT LET THE CAMERA THINK FOR YOU, YOU HAVE TO THINK FOR THE CAMERA AND SHOOT WHAT YOU WANT.

728	POPE TO CELEBRATE SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS FOR 20,000 AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN BY BETH GRIFFIN CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE NEW YORK (CNS) A SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS IS IN THE WORKS WHEN POPE FRANCIS CELEBRATES THE LITURGY WITH 20,000 PEOPLE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN DURING HIS U.S. VISIT. SIMPLE TAKES ON A NEW DIMENSION WHEN THE POPE IS THE CELEBRANT AND THE CONGREGATION CLEARS SECURITY CHECKPOINTS HOURS BEFORE THE OPENING NOTES OF THE ENTRANCE HYMN AT THE SEPT. 25 CELEBRATION. IN SUBSTANCE, EVERY MASS IS THE SAME. THIS ONE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE ELABORATE, NEW YORK CARDINAL TIMOTHY M. DOLAN SAID OF THE ARCHDIOCESES PLANNING EFFORT SEPT. 2. THE LITURGICAL OPTION FOR THE DAY IS THE MASS FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID, EXPLAINING THAT THE CHOICE REFLECTS THE HIGH EMPHASIS POPE FRANCIS PUTS ON THIS, AND BECAUSE THAT DAY HE WILL BE AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND ALSO VISIT TWO SITES IN THE ARCHDIOCESE DEVOTED TO THAT. THE READINGS AND PRAYERS ARE A GIVEN, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID. BUT THE MUSIC, THE GIFTS, THE INTERCESSIONS, THE READERS AND OTHER ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY SELECTED TO REPRESENT THE DIVERSE LANGUAGES, FAMILIES, APOSTOLATES, PARISHES AND MINISTRIES OF THIS VAST REGION, HE SAID. FATHER MATTHEW ERNEST, DIRECTOR OF THE ARCHDIOCESAN OFFICE OF LITURGY, TOLD CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE, THAT SOME OF THE LITURGICAL OPTIONS SELECTED WILL MAKE IT MORE LIKE A SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS, INCLUDING ELIMINATING THE GLORIA AND THE CREED AND USING ONLY ONE READING BEFORE THE GOSPEL. FATHER ERNEST SAID THE FIRST READING WILL BE IN SPANISH, THE GOSPEL WILL BE SUNG IN ENGLISH, AND POPE FRANCIS WILL OFFER THE SECOND EUCHARISTIC PRAYER IN LATIN. HE IS EXPECTED TO PREACH THE HOMILY IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. INTERCESSIONS WILL BE MADE IN ENGLISH, SPANISH, POLISH, GAELIC, GERMAN TIGRINYA AND ITALIAN. THE LITURGIST SAID THE POPE WILL CONCELEBRATE THE MASS WITH CARDINALS, BISHOPS FROM THE NEW YORK PROVINCE AND AN AS-YET-UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF LOCAL PRIESTS. OTHER PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE FAITHFUL PARISHIONERS WHO REPRESENT COMMUNITIES OR MINISTRIES AND SEMINARIANS STUDYING AT ST. JOSEPHS SEMINARY IN YONKERS, NEW YORK. THE SEMINARIANS WILL BE THE SERVERS AND, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THEYRE THRILLED, FATHER ERNEST SAID. WERE PUTTING ALL THE SEMINARIANS TO WORK. THEYRE NOT SIMPLY ATTENDING THE EVENT. SOME ARE SINGING, SOME ARE SERVING, SOME WILL DIRECT TRAFFIC IN THE HALLS. JENNIFER DONELSON, DIRECTOR OF SACRED MUSIC AT THE SEMINARY, SAID 10 SEMINARIANS FROM THE SCHOOLS SCHOLA CHOIR WILL SING THE COMMUNION ANTIPHON. FATHER ERNEST SAID THE VATICAN MADE FEW REQUESTS BEYOND KEEPING THE LITURGY SIMPLE. THE VATICAN ASKED THAT THE GIFTS BE PRESENTED BY A MULTIGENERATIONAL FAMILY, HE SAID. INITIAL PLANNING FOR THE PAPAL MASS BEGAN IN APRIL, FATHER ERNEST SAID. HE CONSULTED WITH THE PRIEST WHO PLANNED POPE BENEDICT XVIS MASS IN WASHINGTON IN 2008. VOLUNTEERS WERE RECRUITED AND COMMITTEES FORMED. FATHER ERNEST PRAISED THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO REVIEW THE EVENTS DETAILS. THIS IS MASS ON A STAGE. IT REQUIRES FORETHOUGHT WITH REGARD TO THE MOVEMENT AND PLACEMENT OF PEOPLE, HE SAID. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS PROVIDING FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF HOLY COMMUNION TO 20,000 PEOPLE, FATHER ERNEST SAID. MORE THAN 200 PERMANENT DEACONS FROM THE ARCHDIOCESE AND THE DIOCESES OF BROOKLYN AND ROCKVILLE CENTRE WILL BE DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AS EUCHARISTIC MINISTERS. THEY WILL BE ASSISTED BY 150 VOLUNTEERS FROM GROUPS INCLUDING THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS, KNIGHTS OF MALTA, KNIGHTS OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE AND ANCIENT ORDER OF HIBERNIANS. FATHER ERNEST SAID IMMIGRANT WOMEN FROM THE OBREROS UNIDOS MISSION IN YONKERS ARE EMBROIDERING THE ALTAR LINENS AND PURIFICATORS. MANY OF THE ITEMS USED AT THE MASS MAY LOOK FAMILIAR. THE SIMPLE CIBORIA WILL BE THE SAME DESIGN AS THOSE USED FOR POPE BENEDICT XVIS MASS AT YANKEE STADIUM. THEIR LIDS HAVE A COMMEMORATIVE INSCRIPTION AND THE SIDES BEAR THE PAPAL COAT OF ARMS AND THE SEAL OF THE ARCHDIOCESE. AS IN 2008, THEY WILL BE GIVEN TO NEW YORK PARISHES AFTER THE VISIT. POPE FRANCIS WILL USE THE SAME CHALICE POPE BLESSED PAUL VI USED WHEN HE CELEBRATED MASS IN YANKEE STADIUM OCT. 4, 1965. IT IS CURRENTLY ON DISPLAY AT ST. JOSEPHS SEMINARY. CARDINAL DOLAN SAID THE HOLY FATHER WILL CARRY A PASTORAL STAFF THAT IS A REPLICA OF ONE USED IN NEW YORK BY PAUL VI, JOHN PAUL II AND BENEDICT XVI. SPEAKING COURTSIDE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, THE CARDINAL UNVEILED THE OAK PRESIDERS CHAIR POPE FRANCIS WILL USE AT THE MASS. IT WAS BUILT BY IMMIGRANT DAY LABORERS FROM THE DON BOSCO WORKERS, INC. IN PORT CHESTER, NEW YORK. THE CHAIR IS VERY IMPORTANT IN CATHOLIC IMAGINATION, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID. IT IS A GREAT SYMBOL OF UNITY AND THE TEACHING AUTHORITY THE POPE HAS. HE DESCRIBED THE WOODEN CHAIR AS VERY SIMPLE, WITH NO DESIGNS, ACCORDING WITH THE WISHES OF THE POPE. JENNIFER PASCUAL, DIRECTOR OF MUSIC AT ST. PATRICKS CATHEDRAL, TOLD CNS THAT THE MUSIC FOR THE MASS WILL BE PROVIDED UNDER HER DIRECTION BY 115 MEMBERS OF TWO CHOIRS NEW YORK ARCHDIOCESAN FESTIVAL CHORALE AND THE CATHEDRAL CHOIR OF ST. PATRICKS AND A 40-PERSON ORCHESTRA. THE ORCHESTRA IS BEING ASSEMBLED WITH THE HELP OF A CONTRACTOR, SHE SAID, AND IS COMPRISED OF A LOT OF FAITH-FILLED PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCITED TO BE HERE. PASCUAL COMMISSIONED SOME MUSIC, BUT GENERALLY CHOSE PIECES THAT WILL BE FAMILIAR TO THE WORSHIPPERS AND ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION. SOME OF THE SELECTIONS ARE MULTILINGUAL. IM TRYING TO MAKE IT AS CONGREGATIONAL-FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE, SHE SAID. SEPTEMBER 3, 2015 ADMIN COMMENTS OFF ON POPE TO CELEBRATE SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS FOR 20,000 AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
729	JAMES MADISON U START-UP GETS SEED FUNDING FOR OBSERVATION PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY BY DAVID SCHWARTZ PUBLISHED: SEPTEMBER 9TH, 2015 A HARRISONBURG, VA-BASED COMPANY SPUN OUT OF JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY (JMU) HAS CLOSED A $250,000 SEED ROUND TO COMMERCIALIZE A TETHERED, HOVERING OBSERVATION PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY. BLUE VIGILS INNOVATION IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A LOW ALTITUDE VANTAGE POINT WHILE CARRYING A WIDE VARIETY OF CAMERAS, SENSORS OR RADIO EQUIPMENT. THE TECHNOLOGY IS MOBILE, LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO USE, REMOVING THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MANPOWER OR TRAINING. BLUE VIGIL WILL OFFER A POWERFUL OBSERVATION AND COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, FIRST RESPONDERS, EVENT ORGANIZERS AND OTHERS, SAYS THE START-UPS CEO TODD STAVE. THE SUPPORT FROM THE HARRISONBURG INVESTMENT COMMUNITY AND JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY IS ALLOWING US TO RAPIDLY BRING THIS VALUABLE TECHNOLOGY TO THE MARKETS. INNOVATETECH VENTURES, A HERNDON, VA-BASED FIRM SPECIALIZING IN DEVELOPING EARLY-STAGE TECH COMPANIES, AND A SMALL GROUP OF REGIONAL INVESTORS WORKED WITH JMUS OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO IDENTIFY THE TECHNOLOGY, RECRUITING STAVE, AN EXPERIENCED ENTREPRENEUR, TO SERVE AS CEO. BRINGING TOGETHER PEOPLE TO CREATE LOCALLY BASED TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW JMU IS ENGAGED WITH THE COMMUNITY, SAYS UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT JONATHAN ALGER. THE UNIVERSITY HAS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH BLUE VIGIL TO PROVIDE THE START-UP WITH OFFICE SPACE AS WELL AS ACCESS TO INTERNS AND RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED TO KEEPING AT LEAST HALF OF ITS JOBS IN HARRISONBURG FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THE LAUNCH OF BLUE VIGIL THROUGH THE COLLABORATION OF JMU, INNOVATETECH AND HARRISONBURG PRIVATE INVESTORS IS A PRIVATE-PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP ENABLING THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF A DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY IN A MANNER WHICH SUPPORTS REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOALS, SAYS DR. YVONNE HARRIS, JMU VICE PROVOST FOR RESEARCH AND SCHOLARSHIP. JMU PLANS TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THESE PARTNERS TO DEVELOP MORE START-UPS USING THIS MODEL.

730	THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPPED BY NEARLY THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS BETWEEN 2013 AND 2104, ACCORDING THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, FROM 13.3 TO 10.4 PERCENT. PUT ANOTHER WAY, 8.8 MILLION MORE PEOPLE WERE INSURED IN 2014 THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. THE ANNUAL STUDY FROM CENSUS IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE MEASURE OF HEALTH INSURANCE, ALTHOUGH A CHANGE IN THE WAY HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED MAKE THIS YEAR'S REPORT COMPARABLE TO 2013 BUT NOT EARLIER YEARS. CENSUS OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT A DIFFERENT ANNUAL SURVEY THAT HAS ASKED HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THIS TO BE THE BIGGEST DROP IN THE UNINSURED SINCE AT LEAST 2008. OTHERS SAY THE SIZABLE INCREASE IN AMERICANS WITH INSURANCE DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL HEALTH LAW IS UNPRECEDENTED SINCE THE CREATION OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID 50 YEARS AGO. "IT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DROP EVER," SAID PAUL FRONSTIN, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH RESEARCH AT THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WHO HAS BEEN STUDYING THE UNINSURED SINCE 1993. MORE IMPORTANTLY, SAID DIANE ROWLAND, HEAD OF THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION'S COMMISSION ON MEDICAID AND THE UNINSURED, "THE GAINS ARE EXACTLY WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WERE," MEANING THE LARGEST INCREASES IN COVERAGE WERE IN THOSE GROUPS WITH TRADITIONALLY THE HIGHEST RATES OF UNINSURANCE YOUNGER, WORKING-AGE ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH LOW AND MODERATE INCOMES. (KAISER HEALTH NEWS IS AN EDITORIALLY INDEPENDENT PROGRAM OF THE FOUNDATION.) DESPITE THE GAINS, THE CENSUS STUDY FOUND THAT 33 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT INSURANCE. WHILE THE GAINS IN INSURANCE COVERAGE WERE WIDESPREAD, THEY WEREN'T EQUAL IN EVERY CATEGORY. NOT SURPRISINGLY, AMONG TYPES OF COVERAGE, THE BIGGEST INCREASES WERE IN PEOPLE COVERED BY MEDICAID (UP 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 62 MILLION PEOPLE) AND PEOPLE BUYING THEIR OWN HEALTH PLANS (UP 3.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 14.6 MILLION PEOPLE). EXPANDING MEDICAID AND MAKING PRIVATE INSURANCE EASIER TO PURCHASE BY THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER COVERAGE WERE KEY FOCUSES OF THE HEALTH LAW. BUT THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REMAINS EMPLOYERS. THAT NUMBER HELD STEADY AT AROUND 55 PERCENT. THE UNINSURED RATE DROPPED FOR EVERY AGE, INCOME AND ETHNIC GROUP AND IN EVERY STATE, ALTHOUGH, AGAIN, SOME GAINED MORE THAN OTHERS. THOSE AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE WERE MORE LIKELY TO GAIN INSURANCE THAN THOSE WITH MORE RESOURCES. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN $25,000 PER YEAR DROPPED 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE RATE FOR THOSE WITH INCOMES BETWEEN $25,000 AND $50,000 DROPPED 5 POINTS. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR THOSE EARNING MORE THAN $100,000 ANNUALLY DROPPED TOO, BUT BY LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT. SIMILARLY, THE UNINSURED RATE FOR THE WHITE NON-HISPANIC POPULATION (THE ETHNICITY MOST LIKELY TO HAVE INSURANCE) DROPPED BY JUST OVER 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS, WHILE THE RATES FOR BLACKS, ASIAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS DROPPED BY MORE THAN 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS EACH. AMONG STATES, MASSACHUSETTS (WHICH BEGAN REQUIRING MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE INSURANCE IN 2006) HAD THE LOWEST RATE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT COVERAGE, AT 3.3 PERCENT, WHILE TEXAS CONTINUED TO LEAD THE NATION WITH THE HIGHEST UNINSURED RATE 19.1 PERCENT. STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, HOWEVER, SAW OVERALL GAINS IN INSURANCE NOT JUST MEDICAID THAT WERE LARGER THAN THOSE THAT DIDN'T. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE WITH INCOMES ABOVE POVERTY BUT LESS THAN FOUR TIMES THAT (MOST OF WHOM AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID) STILL SAW AN OVERALL DECLINE IN UNINSURANCE OF 6.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, WHILE STATES THAT DIDN'T TAKE THAT OPTION SAW THAT RATE DROP BY ONLY 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS.
731	BY BEN LEVISOHN STOCKS BATTLED BACK IN A BIG WAY TODAY. EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY THE S&P 500 ROSE 2.5% TO 1,969.41, THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ADVANCED 390.30 POINTS, OR 2.4%, TO 16.492.68 AS ALL 30 STOCKS IN THE BLUE-CHIP BENCHMARK FINSIHED HIGHER, AND THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE GAINED 2.7% TO 4,811.93. PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE, ONLY 12 OF THE STOCKS IN THE S&P 500 FINISHED IN THE RED TODAY. THE FOLKS AT BESPOKE INVESTMENT GROUP MARVEL AT THE SHEER NUMBER OF SUCH ALL OR NOTHING DAYS: LONG TERM CLIENTS OF BESPOKE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH OUR TERM ALL OR NOTHING DAYS, BUT FOR THOSE THAT ARENT, AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY IS A DAY WHERE THE NET ADVANCE/DECLINE READING FOR THE S&P 500 (NUMBER OF ADVANCERS ON A DAILY BASIS MINUS NUMBER OF DECLINERS) IS ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400. SINCE THE SELL-OFF REALLY BEGAN IN EARNEST ON 8/20/15, THE S&P 500S DAILY ADVANCE/DECLINE READING HAS BEEN ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400 ON EIGHT TRADING DAYS THROUGH FRIDAY (AS OF 2PM MONDAY, THE S&P 500S A/D READING IS CURRENTLY ABOVE +400 AGAIN). TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, PRIOR TO 8/20 THERE HAD ONLY BEEN 13 TRADING DAYS IN ALL OF 2015 WHERE THE S&P 500 HAD AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY. WE LOOKED TO SEE HOW COMMON IT HAS BEEN TO SEE EIGHT ALL OR NOTHING DAYS OVER A TWELVE TRADING DAY PERIOD, AND FOUND THAT SINCE OUR DAILY BREADTH DATA BEGINS IN 1990, THESE EVENTS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY RARE. IN FACT, THE ONLY TWO PERIODS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE WAS DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN LATE NOVEMBER/EARLY DECEMBER 2008 (WHERE WE SAW FIVE STRAIGHT DAILY OCCURRENCES) AND ON ONE DAY DURING THE 2011 CORRECTION ON 10/6/11. BMOS BRIAN BELSKI ARGUES THAT S&P 500 FUNDAMENTALS WEATHERED THE STORM: DESPITE A DIFFICULT MONTH FOR STOCK PRICES, UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS REMAINED LARGELY INTACT ACCORDING TO OUR MODELS. AS A RESULT, WE VIEW THE RECENT WEAKNESS AS MORE TECHNICAL IN NATURE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT U.S. ECONOMIC DATA CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. ONE SILVER LINING OF THE RECENT PLUNGE WAS THAT S&P 500 VALUATION REGISTERED ONE OF THE LARGEST MONTHLY CONTRACTIONS OF THIS BULL MARKET. HOWEVER, VALUATION REMAINS ELEVATED FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, BUT HAS RETREATED FROM ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVELS. BY CONTRAST, EARNINGS-RELATED DATA CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OVERALL FUNDAMENTAL LEVELS AND ESPECIALLY REVISIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPROVING SHARPLY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. IN FACT, OUR FUNDAMENTAL COMPOSITE HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT AFTER BOTTOMING EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WHICH SHOULD BE A VIEWED AS A POSITIVE SIGN FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT SOMETHING MORE OMINOUS IS ON THE HORIZON FOR U.S. STOCKS. WHAT, ME WORRY?

733	UPDATED THOSE OPTIONS WERE REVISED AND NARROWED DOWN BY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND HALL COUNTY STAFF UNTIL THE FINAL LOGO DESIGN WAS COMPLETE. THE NEW LOGO DESIGN AND SLOGAN WERE A PART OF A LARGER REBRANDING EFFORT, WHICH INCLUDED A REDESIGN OF THE COUNTY WEBSITE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONAL VALUES AND THE RELEASE OF A HALL COUNTY PROMOTIONAL VIDEO. GAINESVILLE - HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT RECEIVED NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR ITS NEW LOGO DESIGN PROJECT DURING LAST WEEK'S 3CMA CONFERENCE IN ATLANTA. 3CMA, THE CITY-COUNTY COMMUNICATIONS AND MARKETING ASSOCIATION, IS A NETWORK OF PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC COMMUNICATORS AND MARKETERS FROM ALL OVER THE NATION. THE ORGANIZATION'S ANNUAL SAVVY AWARDS COMPETITION RECOGNIZES OUTSTANDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACHIEVEMENTS IN COMMUNICATIONS, PUBLIC-SECTOR MARKETING AND CITIZEN-GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS. HALL COUNTY COMPETED AGAINST HUNDREDS OF ENTRIES FROM GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY - AND WAS PRESENTED WITH THE SILVER CIRCLE AWARD FOR THELOGO DESIGN PROJECT, WHICH WAS COMPLETED LAST YEAR. "THE LOGO DESIGN PROJECT WAS TRULY A GRASSROOTS EFFORT, LAUNCHED WITH THE INPUT OF CITIZENS AND EMPLOYEES," HALL COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR RANDY KNIGHTON SAID. "WE ARE HONORED TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE THOROUGH AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROCESS WE USED TO PRODUCE A QUALITY BRAND THAT TRULY EXEMPLIFIES HALL COUNTY'S UNIQUE ASSETS." THE LOGO FEATURES TWO FLOWING BLUE STRIPES, A SOFT GREEN ARC AND THE IMAGE OF A RISING YELLOW SUN, COMPLETE WITH "RAYS" IN THE SHAPE OF MECHANICAL COGS. EACH ELEMENT OF THE LOGO HIGHLIGHTS A DISTINCT CHARACTERISTIC OF HALL COUNTY. "THE BLUE STREAKS REPRESENT LAKE LANIER, AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF HALL COUNTY'S LANDSCAPE AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE," SAID KATIE CRUMLEY, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER FOR HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT. "THE BLUE LINES ALSO RESEMBLE ROADWAYS, GIVING A NOD TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE HALL COUNTY PROVIDES AND MAINTAINS FOR ITS CITIZENS." CRUMLEY SAID THE GREEN ARC IS REMINISCENT OF HALL COUNTY'S LOCATION AT THE FOOTHILLS OF THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS AND THE AREA'S RICH AGRICULTURAL HERITAGE. THE RISING SUN REPRESENTS THE COUNTY'S CURRENT STATE OF GROWTH AND POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. "THE MECHANICAL COGS SEEN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SUN ALSO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE FACT THAT HALL COUNTY IS MOVING FORWARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND THRIVE IN THE FUTURE," SHE SAID.  HALL COUNTY BEGAN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A NEW LOGO IN 2013 WITH A COUNTYWIDE SURVEY AVAILABLE ON THE COUNTY'S WEBSITE, HALLCOUNTY.ORG. THE SURVEY ASKED FOR FEEDBACK FROM HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND HALL COUNTY RESIDENTS ABOUT WHAT IMAGES, COLORS, FONTS AND MORE SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN THE NEW DESIGN. THE SURVEY ALSO ASKED WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN A FOCUS GROUP DEDICATED TO EXPOUNDING ON THE SURVEY RESPONSES.  FOLLOWING THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CITIZEN AND EMPLOYEE INPUT, FORUM COMMUNICATIONS,A LOCAL FULL-SERVICE STRATEGIC MARKETING AGENCY , WAS HIRED AS A CONSULTANT FOR THE ACTUAL DESIGN OF THE LOGO. USING INPUT GENERATED FROM CITIZEN SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS, SEVERAL LOGO OPTIONS WERE DEVELOPED.

DEEPENING WORRIES OVER CHINAS SLOWDOWN PUSHED DOWN MOST MARKETS ELSEWHERE IN THE REGION, INCLUDING THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, WHICH HIT ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN SIX YEARS. IN JAPAN, THE NIKKEI 225 INDEX DOCKED 70.29 POINTS, OR 0.4%, TO 18,095.40. THE JAPANESE YEN BRIEFLY TOUCHED 120.46 AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THE NIKKEI TURNED TO POSITIVE TERRITORY EARLIER IN THE DAY. A WEAKER YEN USUALLY BODES WELL FOR JAPANESE EXPORTERS, WHO THEN PAY LOWER COSTS AT HOME. IN HONG KONG, THE HANG SENG INDEX FELL 250.49 POINTS, OR 1.2%, TO 20,934.94, THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FELL BELOW $0.70 U.S. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2009, AFTER DATA OUT WEDNESDAY SHOWED THE COUNTRYS ECONOMY GREW BY AN ANNUALIZED 2% IN THE SECOND QUARTER, MISSING THE 2.2% GROWTH ECONOMISTS HAD EXPECTED. THE SLOWDOWN IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS DUE MAINLY TO REDUCED MINING AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, COUPLED WITH A DROP IN THE VOLUME AND VALUE OF COMMODITIES EXPORTS. THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON COMMODITIES EXPORTS TO CHINA AND HAS BEEN DEEPLY AFFECTED BY CHINAS SLOWING GROWTH. CHINA IN CHINA, THE CSI 300 REGAINED 3.75 POINTS, OR 0.1%, TO 3,365.83 THE INDEX STAGED TWO STRIKING REBOUNDS DURING THE TRADING DAY, SLUMPING INTO THE NEGATIVE IN THE AFTERNOON, ONLY TO SURGE AGAIN IN THE FINAL HALF-HOUR OF TRADING. ANALYSTS SAID GOVERNMENT FUNDS WERE PLOWING CASH INTO THE MARKET AS BEIJING ATTEMPTS TO CHEER UP DOMESTIC INVESTORS AHEAD OF A NATIONAL HOLIDAY ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. DESPITE A MARKET DOWN ALMOST 40% FROM ITS JUNE PEAK, CHINA IS FOCUSING ON ITS POLITICAL IMAGE FOR NOW: AUTHORITIES WILL PUT ON A MILITARY PARADE IN THE CAPITAL ON THURSDAY TO CELEBRATE THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF WORLD WAR II. SOME 50 CHINESE BROKERAGE FIRMS WILL CHANNEL OVER 100 BILLION YUAN TO A SPECIAL ACCOUNT OVERSEEN BY STATE-RUN CHINA SECURITIES FINANCE CORP. TO INVEST IN BLUE-CHIPS, ACCORDING TO A SECURITIES TIMES REPORT WEDNESDAY. REINFORCING THE REPORT, MORE THAN A DOZEN OF CHINAS LEADING SECURITIES FIRMSINCLUDING CITIC SECURITIES, HUATAI SECURITIES AND GF SECURITIESHAVE ISSUED A SERIES OF STATEMENTS SINCE TUESDAY SAYING THEY WOULD CONTRIBUTE 20% OF THEIR TOTAL ASSETS TO THE NEW FUNDING PLAN. OF THOSE, CITIC SECURITIES WILL BE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR WITH 5.4 BILLION YUAN. STILL, THE MARKET STRUGGLED. INVESTORS APPEARED TO WANT TO TAKE MONEY OFF THE TABLE, BEFORE CHINAS MARKETS CLOSED ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. FOREIGN INVESTORS SOLD STOCKS IN SHANGHAI FOR THE FOURTH STRAIGHT DAY VIA A TRADING LINK WITH HONG KONG. THE SHANGHAI COMPOSITE LOST 2.2% OVER THE WEEK. ON TUESDAY, CHINAS OFFICIAL MANUFACTURING PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX FOR AUGUST FELL TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN THREE YEARS. SOUTH KOREAN EXPORTS, AN INDICATOR OF THE HEALTH OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, FELL 14.7% IN AUGUST, AMPLIFYING INVESTORS GLOOM. THIS WAS THE FIRST EVIDENCE OF A DECLINE IN REGIONAL TRADE SINCE CHINA DEVALUED ITS CURRENCY ON AUG. 11. OTHER FIGURES SHOWED A CONTRACTION IN EXPORTS IN JAPAN. IN OTHER MARKETS IN KOREA, THE KOSPI INDEX INCHED UP 0.99 POINTS, OR 0.1%, TO 1,915.22 IN SINGAPORE, THE STRAITS TIMES INDEX DROPPED 4.64 POINTS, OR 0.2%, TO 2,878.13 IN TAIWAN, THE TAIEX INDEX RECOVERED 17.73 POINTS, OR 0.2%, TO 8,035.29 THE NZX 50 FALTERED 64.78 POINTS, OR 1.2%, TO 5,509.21 THE ASX 200 INDEX EKED UP 5.05 POINTS, OR 0.1%, TO 5,1
738	TOM ELLIS IN LONDON, AUGUST 2015. PHOTOS: MATT HOLYOAK . STYLING: NIC JOTTKANDT . GROOMING: LARRY KING FOR STREETERS. PHOTO ASSISTANTS: JACK DONCASTER AND SAM WILSON. IN LUCIFER , FOX'S 2016 DRAMEDY BASED ON THE GRAPHIC NOVELS BY NEIL GAIMAN, THE DEVIL IS MORE MISCHIEVOUS THAN CRUEL. HE LOOKS A BIT LIKE JAMES BONDOR PERHAPS A VILLAIN OUT OF JAGUAR'S "IT'S GOOD TO BE BAD" COMMERCIAL AND HAS THE MORALS OF A DEBAUCHED INVESTMENT BANKER (ALBEIT WITH A LITTLE MORE HEART). "I SUPPOSE HE'S KIND OF A CADDISH FIGURE," SAYS TOM ELLIS, WHO STARS AS LUCIFER MORNINGSTAR. "FOR ME, IT WAS APPARENT THAT HE WAS FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE CHARACTERS. HE READ LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A HIGH-STYLE THEATER PLAY BY OSCAR WILDE OR NOEL COWARD," HE CONTINUES. "THAT GIVE ME THE BACKBONE OF WHAT I WAS DOING, INFUSED WITH A BIT OF ROCK 'N' ROLL AND MICK JAGGER. YOU'VE GOT THIS KIND OF FLAMBOYANT CHARACTER AT THE END OF IT." NOW IN HIS MID-30S, ELLIS GREW UP IN THE U.K. AND WENT TO DRAMA SCHOOL AT THE ROYAL SCOTTISH ACADEMY IN GLASGOW WITH JAMES MCAVOY, SAM HEUGHAN , AND LAURA DONNELLY , AMONG OTHERS. HE'S SPENT MUCH OF HIS 15-YEAR CAREER ON TELEVISION; LAST YEAR HE STARRED AS ANOTHER SUAVE BAD-BOY ON U.S.A.'S RUSH , AND, FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, HE'S PLAYED GARY PRESTON IN THE CULT BRITISH COMEDY MIRANDA . WE RECENTLY SPOKE WITH ELLIS VIA THE PHONE. EMMA BROWN: CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU GOT INVOLVED IN LUCIFER ? TOM ELLIS: IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW SCRIPTS THAT I READ DURING PILOT SEASON THIS YEAR THAT, AS SOON AS I READ IT, I SAID, "THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO." IT WAS MUCH FUNNIER THAN ANYTHING THAT I HAD READ. I MET LEN WISEMAN, WHO HAD COME ON BOARD AS THE DIRECTOR. IT WAS INSTANTANEOUS FOR ME FROM THAT MOMENT. HE MADE IT QUITE APPARENT THAT HE WANTED ME TO DO IT, AND I REALLY WANTED TO DO THE PROJECT, SO IT WAS JUST ABOUT GETTING THE STUDIO AND EVERYONE ON BOARD. THAT CAME QUITE QUICKLY AS WELL. PILOT SEASON'S SUCH A STRANGE TIME. YOU GET SUCH A CONCENTRATED AMOUNT OF SCRIPTS. A LOT OF THEM BECOME WHITE NOISE AFTER A WHILE. WHEN SOMETHING REALLY POPS, IT BECOMES APPARENT VERY QUICKLY. I'M QUITE INSTINCTIVE ABOUT THAT. I KNOW, NORMALLY BY ABOUT 10 PAGES IN, WHETHER I WANT TO DO SOMETHING OR NOT. BROWN: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST PILOT SEASON? ELLIS: IT WAS BACK IN 2008. I DID A PILOT FOR FOX. THE MORE YOU DO, THE MORE YOU LEARN ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO GET OUT THE EXPERIENCE. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GO THERE JUST TO GET A JOB AND THAT'S NOT MY MOTIVATION ANY MORE. I WANT TO BE DOING THE RIGHT JOB. BROWN: WHEN DID YOU HAVE THAT REALIZATIONTHAT YOU WANTED TO DO THE RIGHT JOB? ELLIS: I'VE BEEN ACTING FOR 15 YEARS NOW, AND THE MORE YOU DO, THE MORE CONFIDENCE YOU GET ABOUT "THIS IS MY CAREER AND THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING." SINCE I'VE STARTED COMING TO THE STATES, I'VE HAD A REALLY GREAT RESPONSE. IT'S GIVEN ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE TO BE MORE JUDICIOUS ABOUT MY OWN CHOICES. I IMAGINE THAT'S PROBABLY HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. I'VE SORT OF GROWN INTO A MAN MYSELF. BROWN: DO YOU COME FROM AN ARTISTIC FAMILY? WAS BEING AN ACTOR A FEASIBLE GOAL FOR YOU? ELLIS: MY MUM WAS A MUSIC TEACHER. I'VE GOT THREE SISTERS AND WE ALL PLAYED INSTRUMENTS WHEN WE WERE KIDS. BROWN: WHAT DID YOU PLAY? ELLIS: I STARTED ON THE TRUMPET AND THEN I UPGRADED TO THE FRENCH HORN. I PLAYED IN ORCHESTRAS MY ENTIRE TEENAGE YEARS. BUT, ON THE DRAMA FRONT, NO, NOT REALLY. MY DAD, STRANGELY ENOUGH FOR THIS JOB, WAS A BAPTIST PASTOR, SO I GREW UP IN THE CHURCH AS WELL. I SUPPOSE THERE IS A DRAMATIC ELEMENT TO HIS JOB, AND HE ENJOYED DOING AMATEUR OPERATICS. BROWN: WERE YOU IN A NATIVITY PLAY? ELLIS: I WAS IN A NATIVITY PLAY, BUT BEING A SON OF THE PASTOR, I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO PLAY JOSEPH OR ANY OF THE BIG PARTS FOR POLITICAL REASONS. BROWN: WHAT DOES YOU FAMILY THINK OF THIS SHOW? ELLIS: THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET; THEY'VE SEEN THE TRAILER. THEY'RE ALL THRILLED THAT I'M DOING IT. IT'S ALREADY THROWN UP A BIT OF DEBATE, THIS SHOW. I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT TAKE THE SHOW IN THE SPIRIT IT'S MEANT TO BE RECEIVED WILL GET THE MOST OUT OF IT. ANYONE THAT'S PREDICTING IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING BEFORE EVEN SEEING IT IS A BIT FOOLISH, IN MY VIEW. THE SHOW CERTAINLY IS NOT A BIG THEOLOGICAL DEBATE. MORE THAN ANYTHING, I'D SAY THIS SHOW IS A STORY OF REDEMPTION. OBVIOUSLY ONE OF OUR MAIN SOURCE MATERIALS WAS THE GRAPHIC NOVEL THAT IT WAS BASED ON. BROWN: WERE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE GRAPHIC NOVEL BEFOREHAND? ELLIS: I WASN'T AT ALL ACTUALLY. I HAVE TO EMBARRASSINGLY ADMIT, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS BASED ON A GRAPHIC NOVEL UNTIL AFTER I GOT THE JOB AND I READ IT ON DEADLINE . I'M KIND OF GLAD I DIDN'T, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T AFFECT MY CHOICES AT FIRST. BROWN: WHEN YOU TOLD YOUR PARENTS YOU WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR, WHAT WAS THEIR REACTION? ELLIS: IT WAS QUITE LATE. IT WASN'T LIKE I TOLD THEM THIS WHEN I WAS 12 AND BLINDLY PUT THE REST OF MY EDUCATION TO ONE SIDE; IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I SORT OF STUMBLED ACROSS IN MY LATER SCHOOL YEARS. THEY WERE INFORMED BY MY DRAMA TEACHER, WHO I'M STILL FRIENDS WITH ACTUALLY. THERE WAS A PARENTS' EVENING AND THEY CAME IN AND MET HER, AND SHE WAS LIKE, "YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT LETTING TOM GO TO DRAMA SCHOOL." IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT SOMEONE HAD REALLY DONE THAT. SO THEY WERE QUIETLY SUPPORTIVE; THEY WERE NEVER STARRY PARENTS, GOING, "OUR KID'S GOING TO BE SUCH-AND-SUCH." THEY JUST LET ME GET ON WITH IT, AND I APPRECIATED THAT BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN ME A GOOD SORT OF WORK ETHIC. I DON'T FEEL ENTITLED TO ANYTHING. BROWN: WHAT MADE YOU CHOOSE TO GO TO DRAMA SCHOOL AT THE ROYAL SCOTTISH ACADEMY? ELLIS: I WAS LIMITED IN MY OPTIONS. I COULDN'T REALLY AFFORD TO BE A STUDENT IN LONDON. I HAD A FRIEND UP AT GLASGOW UNIVERSITY AND I WENT UP TO VISIT HIM AND JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH THE CITY. I THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING. BROWN: WAS YOUR PROGRAM MOSTLY THEATER BASED? ELLIS: YES, ALMOST COMPLETELY. THE WEIRD THING ABOUT DRAMA SCHOOL IS THAT YOU TRAIN FOR THREE YEARS FOR ONE THING AND THEN MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T TRAINED FOR THAT YOU END UP DOING. BROWN: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST JOB? ELLIS: MY FIRST PROFESSIONAL JOB WAS WHILE I WAS STILL AT DRAMA SCHOOL. MY BEST FRIEND IN MY YEAR WAS JAMES MCAVOY, AND JAMES AND I WERE GIVEN A TERM OFF TO GO AND DO A PANTOMIME IN SCOTLAND, WHICH WAS PART OF OUR CURRICULUM AT THE TIME. WE NEEDED TO DO A PANTOMIME AT THE SCHOOL, OR IF WE BOOKED A PROFESSIONAL GIG, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GO AND DO IT. SO WE WENT TO A PLACE CALLED KIRKCALDY AND DID BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. I WAS THE BEAST AND THE PRINCE. BROWN: WHO WAS JAMES? ELLIS: IN PANTOMIME THERE'S SORT OF THESE TOKEN CHARACTERS IN EACH SCRIPT. HE WAS THE YOUNG, SILLY CHARACTERSORT OF LIKE BUTTONS IN CINDERELLA. [ LAUGHS ] BROWN: IT'S NICE THAT YOU WERE ALLOWED TO GO OFF AND DO PROFESSIONAL GIGS. I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF DRAMA SCHOOLS DON'T WANT YOU TO DO ANYTHING PROFESSIONAL UNTIL YOU GRADUATE. ELLIS: I THINK WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE WITH OUR PRINCIPAL AT THE TIME. HE WAS VERY FORWARD-THINKING. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO GET YOUR STUDENTS OUT WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY. I ENDED UP LEAVING A TERM EARLY BECAUSE I GOT ANOTHER JOB. IT WAS QUITE A FLUID TRANSITION INTO WORKING, WHICH WAS MORE THAN I HOPED FOR. WHEN YOU'RE A DRAMA STUDENT, I THINK THE MOST YOU HOPE FOR IS TO MAKE A LIVING OUT OF ACTING. BROWN: WERE THEY QUITE ENCOURAGING AT SCHOOL? I SPOKE TO SAM HEUGHAN, WHO ALSO WENT TO RSA, AND HE SAID THAT ONE OF HIS PROFESSORS TOLD HIM HE COULDN'T ACT. ELLIS: I KNEW SAM AT DRAMA SCHOOL A LITTLE BIT. I'VE HAD THESE SORT OF CHATS WITH HIM BEFORE. MY EXPERIENCE WASN'T THAT. I FELT VERY ENCOURAGED, CERTAINLY BY A FEW KEY MEMBERS OF STAFF THERE. BUT I ALSO HAD PEOPLE WHOSE CONFIDENCE WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED AND TAKEN. IT'S A VERY VULNERABLE TIME IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU GO TO DO SOMETHING LIFE THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF FRAGILE CONFIDENCE THERE. I KNOW SAM HAD A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE THAN I DID, BUT ULTIMATELY I WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH MY THREE YEARS THERE. BROWN: ONE OF YOUR FIRST FILMS WAS BUFFALO SOLDIERS WITH JOAQUIN PHOENIX, ANNA PAQUIN, AND ED HARRIS. YOU MUST HAVE BEEN 22. WHAT WAS THAT LIKE? ELLIS: IT WAS A VERY CHASTENING EXPERIENCE. I WENT OUT TO GERMANY TO DO IT. IT WAS A SMALL PART IN A BIG MOVIE, BUT I WAS THERE FOR SIX WEEKS. IT WAS GREAT TO BE A PART OF IT AND WORK WITH JOAQUIN, WHO WAS REALLY LOVELY AND VERY WELCOMING TO THE REST OF HIS CAST. WE HUNG OUT A BIT. THEN WHEN I WATCHED THE MOVIE MY THREE OR FOUR LINES IN IT HAD BEEN DUBBED BY ANOTHER ACTOR. I WAS LIKE, "OH. THAT'S INTERESTING. OKAY." THEY WEREN'T VERY CONFIDENT IN MY AMERICAN ACCENT, WHICH I WASN'T EITHER. IT WAS A LEARNING CURVE. BROWN: DID THEY TELL YOU AHEAD OF TIME? ELLIS: I REMEMBER ON THE SET, THE DIRECTOR WAS STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH MY ACCENT, AND I LOST MY CONFIDENCE A BIT. THEN I WENT TO WATCH IT UNINFORMED: "I'VE GOT A DIFFERENT VOICE..." BROWN: YOU'RE LIKE PHOEBE IN FRIENDS WHEN SHE WAS DUBBED OVER FOR THE "SMELLY CAT" VIDEO. ELLIS: EXACTLY. IT'S MY "SMELLY CAT" EXPERIENCE. LUCIFER WILL AIR ON FOX IN 2016.

739	OTTAWA - AFTER GETTING A BRIEF TASTE OF THE NHL LAST SEASON, MATT PUEMPEL WANTS TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET BACK TO THE BIG LEAGUES. TO GET THERE, HE'LL HAVE TO BEAT OUT ANOTHER YOUNG, HUNGRY FORWARD IN SHANE PRINCE. THE TWO 22-YEAR-OLD LEFT-WINGERS ARE THE FAVOURITES FIGHTING FOR A LONE SPOT ON THE OTTAWA SENATORS ROSTER. AN OPENING WAS CREATED AFTER UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENT ERIK CONDRA CHOSE TO SIGN WITH THE TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING THIS PAST SUMMER. PUEMPEL AND PRINCE QUICKLY REALIZED WHAT IT COULD MEAN FOR THEIR FUTURE. "I WAS HERE ON FREE AGENCY DAY AND (ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER) PIERRE DORION CAME UP TO ME AND ASKED ME IF I WAS HAPPY," PUEMPEL SAID. "IT DEFINITELY MAKES YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE MOTIVATED AND WHEN YOU SEE A LIGHT LIKE THAT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. IT MAKES YOU PUSH A LITTLE HARDER IN THE SUMMER." THE TWO WERE DRAFTED IN 2011 PUEMPEL WAS A FIRST-ROUND PICK, 24TH OVERALL, WHILE PRINCE WAS SELECTED 61ST OVERALL. BOTH PLAYERS WERE RECALLED BY THE SENATORS' LAST SEASON, BUT IT WAS PUEMPEL WHO HAD THE BETTER OPPORTUNITY WITH TWO GOALS AND AN ASSIST IN 13 GAMES BEFORE SUFFERING A HIGH ANKLE SPRAIN THAT ENDED HIS SEASON. IN COMPARISON PRINCE PLAYED JUST TWO GAMES AND HAD ONE ASSIST. THE SENATORS SIGNED PRINCE TO A ONE-YEAR, TWO-WAY EXTENSION THIS SUMMER AND MANY BELIEVE HE HAS THE INSIDE TRACK TO START THE SEASON IN THE NHL SEEING AS HE WOULD HAVE TO CLEAR WAIVERS WHEREAS PUEMPEL WOULDN'T. BOTH WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLEAD THEIR CASE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE SENATORS TAKE ON THE BUFFALO SABRES IN PRE-SEASON ACTION. "FOR THOSE GUYS I WANT TO SEE THAT THEY CAN THINK THE GAME," SAID HEAD COACH DAVE CAMERON. "I WANT TO SEE THAT THEY CAN PLAY WITHOUT THE PUCK AS WELL AS THEY CAN WITH THE PUCK. I THINK BOTH GUYS HAVE THE DESIGNATION THAT THEY'RE OFFENSIVE GUYS, BUT TO PLAY IN THE NHL FOR THOSE TWO GUYS THEY HAVE TO ESTABLISH THEIR GAME FIRST AND THEIR GAME IS A 200-FOOT GAME AS GOOD WITHOUT THE PUCK AS YOU ARE GOOD WITH IT AND THEN THE OFFENCE WILL COME OFF OF THAT." WHILE THE TWO HAVE BEEN TEAMMATES IN BINGHAMTON THE PAST TWO SEASONS, BOTH PLAYERS AGREE AT THIS POINT IT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. PRINCE SCORED IN THE SENATORS 4-3 OVERTIME LOSS TO TORONTO ON MONDAY AND SAYS HE PLANS ON MAINTAINING THE MOMENTUM. PRINCE LED THE BINGHAMTON SENATORS IN SCORING LAST SEASON WITH 28 GOALS AND 37 ASSISTS AND FINISHED SIXTH IN AHL SCORING. "I FEEL GREAT RIGHT NOW," SAID PRINCE. "I GOT MY FIRST GAME UNDER MY BELT AND I'M GOING TO BUILD OFF THAT AND DO WELL HERE." WHILE PUEMPEL WOULD LOVE TO CONTRIBUTE OFFENSIVELY HE SAYS HE PLANS ON FOLLOWING CAMERON'S ADVICE OF JUST STICKING TO WHAT HE KNOWS. "YOU JUST HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE DEFENSIVELY AND THERE'S A LOT MORE THINGS THAN POINTS AT THE NHL LEVEL," SAID PUEMPEL. "I WAS TOLD JUST PLAY LIKE LAST YEAR AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO." NOTES: MATT O'CONNOR AND CHRIS DRIEDGER ARE EXPECTED TO SPLIT PLAYING TIME WEDNESDAY NIGHT IN BUFFALO. BY LISA WALLACE, THE CANADIAN PRESS

741	THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE DROPPED BY NEARLY THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS BETWEEN 2013 AND 2104, ACCORDING THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, FROM 13.3 TO 10.4 PERCENT. PUT ANOTHER WAY, 8.8 MILLION MORE PEOPLE WERE INSURED IN 2014 THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. THE ANNUAL STUDY FROM CENSUS IS CONSIDERED THE DEFINITIVE MEASURE OF HEALTH INSURANCE, ALTHOUGH A CHANGE IN THE WAY HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS ARE ASKED MAKE THIS YEAR'S REPORT COMPARABLE TO 2013 BUT NOT EARLIER YEARS. CENSUS OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT A DIFFERENT ANNUAL SURVEY THAT HAS ASKED HEALTH INSURANCE QUESTIONS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THIS TO BE THE BIGGEST DROP IN THE UNINSURED SINCE AT LEAST 2008. OTHERS SAY THE SIZABLE INCREASE IN AMERICANS WITH INSURANCE DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL HEALTH LAW IS UNPRECEDENTED SINCE THE CREATION OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID 50 YEARS AGO. "IT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DROP EVER," SAID PAUL FRONSTIN, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH RESEARCH AT THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WHO HAS BEEN STUDYING THE UNINSURED SINCE 1993. MORE IMPORTANTLY, SAID DIANE ROWLAND, HEAD OF THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION'S COMMISSION ON MEDICAID AND THE UNINSURED, "THE GAINS ARE EXACTLY WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WERE," MEANING THE LARGEST INCREASES IN COVERAGE WERE IN THOSE GROUPS WITH TRADITIONALLY THE HIGHEST RATES OF UNINSURANCE YOUNGER, WORKING-AGE ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH LOW AND MODERATE INCOMES. (KAISER HEALTH NEWS IS AN EDITORIALLY INDEPENDENT PROGRAM OF THE FOUNDATION.) DESPITE THE GAINS, THE CENSUS STUDY FOUND THAT 33 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT INSURANCE. WHILE THE GAINS IN INSURANCE COVERAGE WERE WIDESPREAD, THEY WEREN'T EQUAL IN EVERY CATEGORY. NOT SURPRISINGLY, AMONG TYPES OF COVERAGE, THE BIGGEST INCREASES WERE IN PEOPLE COVERED BY MEDICAID (UP 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 62 MILLION PEOPLE) AND PEOPLE BUYING THEIR OWN HEALTH PLANS (UP 3.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 14.6 MILLION PEOPLE). EXPANDING MEDICAID AND MAKING PRIVATE INSURANCE EASIER TO PURCHASE BY THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER COVERAGE WERE KEY FOCUSES OF THE HEALTH LAW. BUT THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE REMAINS EMPLOYERS. THAT NUMBER HELD STEADY AT AROUND 55 PERCENT. THE UNINSURED RATE DROPPED FOR EVERY AGE, INCOME AND ETHNIC GROUP AND IN EVERY STATE, ALTHOUGH, AGAIN, SOME GAINED MORE THAN OTHERS. THOSE AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE WERE MORE LIKELY TO GAIN INSURANCE THAN THOSE WITH MORE RESOURCES. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN $25,000 PER YEAR DROPPED 4.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE RATE FOR THOSE WITH INCOMES BETWEEN $25,000 AND $50,000 DROPPED 5 POINTS. THE UNINSURANCE RATE FOR THOSE EARNING MORE THAN $100,000 ANNUALLY DROPPED TOO, BUT BY LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT. SIMILARLY, THE UNINSURED RATE FOR THE WHITE NON-HISPANIC POPULATION (THE ETHNICITY MOST LIKELY TO HAVE INSURANCE) DROPPED BY JUST OVER 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS, WHILE THE RATES FOR BLACKS, ASIAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS DROPPED BY MORE THAN 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS EACH. AMONG STATES, MASSACHUSETTS (WHICH BEGAN REQUIRING MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE INSURANCE IN 2006) HAD THE LOWEST RATE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT COVERAGE, AT 3.3 PERCENT, WHILE TEXAS CONTINUED TO LEAD THE NATION WITH THE HIGHEST UNINSURED RATE 19.1 PERCENT. STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, HOWEVER, SAW OVERALL GAINS IN INSURANCE NOT JUST MEDICAID THAT WERE LARGER THAN THOSE THAT DIDN'T. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE WITH INCOMES ABOVE POVERTY BUT LESS THAN FOUR TIMES THAT (MOST OF WHOM AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID) STILL SAW AN OVERALL DECLINE IN UNINSURANCE OF 6.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN STATES THAT EXPANDED MEDICAID, WHILE STATES THAT DIDN'T TAKE THAT OPTION SAW THAT RATE DROP BY ONLY 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS.
742	THE GARDINER EAST FOLLIES RETURNS FOR YET ANOTHER EXTENDED RUN AT CITY HALL BEGINNING ON TUESDAY MORNING, WHEN CITY OFFICIALS PRESENT THREE SCENARIOS FOR RELOCATING THE HIGHWAYS EASTERN END TO FREE UP VALUABLE WATERFRONT LAND. FOR MUCH OF THIS YEAR, AND SOME OF 2014, THE LIONS SHARE OF PUBLIC, POLICY AND POLITICAL ATTENTION HAS FOCUSED INTENSIVELY ON THE STRETCH BETWEEN CHERRY STREET AND THE DON RIVER . (FOR MORE ON THE ORIGINS OF THE PROBLEMATIC LOOP, READ THIS .) FIRST GULF, WHICH WANTS TO TRANSFORM THE SPRAWLING LEVER BROTHERS SITE INTO TORONTOS CANARY WHARF, HAS A STRONG INTEREST IN THE ALIGNMENT OF THE GARDINER/DVP INTERCHANGE, AS DO THE DEVELOPERS WHO OWN LAND ALONG THE KEATING CHANNEL. IN A SHOW LAST SPRING, SUBURBAN COUNCILLORS PUSHED TO KEEP THE HIGHWAY NETWORK IN TACT, WHILE DOWNTOWNERS FOUGHT TO REPLACE THAT ONE PORTION WITH AN AT-GRADE BOULEVARD. AFTER COUNCIL BACKED THE HYBRID OPTION, STAFF SPENT THE SUMMER CONSULTING WITH WATERFRONT ACTIVISTS, DEVELOPERS AND ENGINEERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PULL THE GARDINER NORTH TOWARDS THE RAILWAY YARD WHILE RE-CONCEPTUALIZING THE INTERCHANGE AS A SET OF RAMPS BETWEEN TWO HIGHWAYS INSTEAD OF A SINGLE CONTINUOUS ROUTE. THE ARM-WAVING ABOUT THE INTERCHANGE, HOWEVER, HAS MEANT THAT ALMOST NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT NASTY SEGMENT OF THE GARDINER THAT RUNS ASTRIDE LAKESHORE BLVD EAST, BETWEEN JARVIS AND CHERRY. INDEED, THE LATEST CITY STAFF REPORT NOTES THAT THE SECTION WEST OF CHERRY WILL LARGELY BE MAINTAINED. AND THEREIN LIES A MASSIVE MISSED OPPORTUNITY, ACCORDING TO ARCHITECT AND PLANNER CALVIN BROOK. HIS FIRM, BROOK MCILROY , HAS PITCHED CITY STAFF ON AN AMBITIOUS SCHEME TO STACK THAT STRETCH OF THE GARDINER ABOVE AN EXPANDED RAIL CORRIDOR AS A MEANS OF CREATING A KILOMETRE-LONG ELEVATED LINEAR PARK, 3.3 HECTARES OF NEW DEVELOPABLE CITY LAND AND A FRESH LEASE ON LIFE FOR LAKESHORE BLVD EAST. THE PLAN [ DOWNLOAD IT FROM DROPBOX ] WILL BE PRESENTED BRIEFLY DURING TOMORROWS COMMITTEE MEETING; CITY OFFICIALS ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED THAT THEYVE COMMISSIONED A COST-BENEFIT EVALUATION. BROOK MCILROYS CONSULTANTS, MEANWHILE, ESTIMATE THAT THE CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR THAT NEW GARDINER SEGMENT WILL BE $316 MILLION AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE OFFSET BY LAND SALES ON 4.3 MILLION SQ.-FT OF FREED-UP SPACE. BROOK, WHO HAS BEEN PONDERING HOW TO UNSTACK THE GARDINER AND THE LAKESHORE FOR MANY YEARS, EXPLAINED HIS PROPOSAL TO SPACING LAST WEEK. METROLINX, HE SAYS, PLANS TO EXPAND ITS GO SERVICE FROM 400 TRAINS PER DAY TO OVER 1,000 AS THE AGENCY MOVES TO AN ELECTRIFIED REGIONAL RAIL OFFERING OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS. THAT MEANS ADDING TRACKS THROUGH THE UNION STATION CORRIDOR, AND THEREFORE WIDENING THE RAILWAY BERM THAT HAS LONG BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE WATERFRONTS POOR ACCESSIBILITY. THE CITY OWNS A LONG FINGER OF LAND SOUTH OF THE TRACKS BETWEEN JARVIS AND CHERRY, AS WELL AS THE LAND BENEATH THE GARDINER AND THE LAKESHORE; THE THREE SLICES ARE ALMOST 70 METRES ACROSS IN SOME PLACES. IF THE CITY AND METROLINX CAN ALIGN THEIR CONSTRUCTION AGENDAS, BROOK SAYS, THEY COULD EXPAND THE EXISTING BERM SOUTH TO CREATE NOT ONLY ADDITIONAL TRACK SPACE, BUT A DECK ABOVE THE NEW TRACKS, UPON WHICH THE FOUR-LANE GARDINER COULD RUN. THE HIGHWAY PORTION, IN TURN, COULD ALSO BE DECKED, CREATING A LINEAR PARK OVERHEAD. THE PREMISE OF THIS IS VERY SIMPLE, HE STATES. ITS TO TAKE TWO INTERRUPTIONS IN THE FABRIC OF THE CITY AND TURN THEM INTO ONE. BROOKS POINTS TO SEVERAL COMPELLING ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF RE-BUILDING THE EASTERN GARDINER IN THIS WAY: STAGING : THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BERM, THE RAIL LINES, THE DECKING, THE HIGHWAY AND THE GREEN ROOF COULD ALL BE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT MAKING ANY ALTERATIONS TO THE EXISTING GARDINER. THAT TRANSLATES INTO NO CONSTRUCTION DELAYS AND ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO STAGING, WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DRIVE UP CAPITAL OUTLAYS. WHEN THE NEW GARDINER IS FINISHED, TRAFFIC CAN BE RE-ROUTED ONTO IT, AND THE DEMOLITION OF THE OLD ONE CAN COMMENCE. UNLOCKING CITY-OWNED LAND . BY STACKING THE GARDINER ON TOP OF THOSE NEW RAIL LINES, THE CITY FREES UP A STRETCH OF LAND THATS ABOUT 40 METRES DEEP AND ALMOST A KILOMETRE LONG MORE THAN ENOUGH SPACE, BROOK SAYS, TO DEVELOP POINT TOWERS, MID-RISE BUILDINGS AND OTHER STRUCTURES ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF LAKESHORE BLVD. EAST PUBLIC SPACE IMPROVEMENTS . WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT NOW POSSIBLE ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF LAKESHORE, THAT STREET GAINS A SECOND LEASE ON LIFE, AND CAN BE TRANSFORMED INTO AN URBAN AVENUE RATHER THAN A SURFACE HIGHWAY. LIKEWISE, THE LINEAR PARK BUILT ABOVE THE DECKED GARDINER WILL SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF THOSE BUILDINGS DEVELOPED NORTH OF LAKESHORE, AS WELL AS OTHER WATERFRONT VISITORS AND INHABITANTS. IT ALSO PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE MID-BLOCK CONNECTIONS AND EVEN WIDER LAND BRIDGES ACROSS THE TRACKS THAT WOULD LINK THE EAST BAYFRONT COMMUNITY TO ST. LAWRENCE. BROOK POINTS OUT THAT THE LINEAR PARK WILL BE ROUGHLY AT THE SAME VERTICAL ELEVATION AS THE DECK OF THE CURRENT GARDINER, SO THIS EXTENDED STRUCTURE WONT SERVE AS YET ANOTHER VISUAL BARRIER. WHATS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT ITS VERY POROUS IN A NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION, HE SAYS, WITH EASY PEDESTRIAN/CYCLIST ACCESS BETWEEN LAKESHORE, THE LINEAR PARK AND GATEWAY POINTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CORRIDOR. HE ALSO OBSERVES THAT BROOKFIELD, THE CANADIAN COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT GIANT, HAS DEPLOYED NEW DECKING TECHNOLOGY AT ITS SPRAWLING HUDSON YARDS PROJECT IN MID-TOWN MANHATTAN, ALLOWING AN ACTIVE COMMUTER RAIL YARD TO CONTINUE FUNCTIONING WHILE A MASSIVE INTENSIFICATION PROJECT IS CONSTRUCTED DIRECTLY ABOVE IT. THE IDEA REQUIRES BOTH POLITICAL WILL, BUT ALSO A LEAP OF FAITH NOT BECAUSE IT IS TECHNICALLY COMPLEX OR FINANCIALLY OUTRAGEOUS, BUT RATHER DUE TO THE FACT THAT TORONTO, WITH ITS INCREMENTALIST POLITICAL CULTURE, HAS LONG TENDED TO SHUN BIG MOVES. YET THE RAILWAY BERM, CONSTRUCTED BACK IN THE 1920S TO MODERNIZE ACCESS TO AN INDUSTRIALIZING WATERFRONT, WAS A BIG MOVE, AS WAS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE GARDINER IN THE MID-1950S. BIG MOVES, ONE COULD ARGUE, MUST BE MET WITH OTHER BIG MOVES. AND THATS WHAT BROOK WILL BE PROPOSING TOMORROW. WITH THE GARDINER EAST EA DUE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE PROVINCE BY NEXT SPRING, MUNICIPAL AND PROVINCIAL POLITICIANS SHOULD LISTEN TO BROOK BECAUSE HIS IDEA IS NOT ONLY PLAUSIBLE; IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE TRANSFORMATIONAL IN A HIGHLY CHALLENGED GEOGRAPHY THAT REQUIRES US, FINALLY, TO MAKE NO (MORE) LITTLE PLANS .

744	EVERYONE FROM MILITARY AFICIONADOS TO KIDS WHO DIG COOL TRUCKS LINED THE STREETS OF HISTORIC DOWNTOWN VILLA RICA THURSDAY EVENING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE MILITARY VEHICLE PRESERVATION ASSOCIATION 2015 BANKHEAD HIGHWAY CROSS-COUNTRY CONVOY.THE CONVOY, CONSISTING OF ABOUT 65 MILITARY VEHICLES AND MOVING AT TOP SPEEDS OF 35 MILES PER HOUR, IS TRAVELING FROM WASHINGTON TO SAN DIEGO AND STOPPED IN VILLA RICA ON THURSDAY NIGHT AT THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF VILLA RICA, WHERE THEY WERE GREETED BY APPROXIMATELY 1,500 PEOPLE. MILITARY VEHICLE FANS WERE INVITED TO THE CHURCH TO GET AN UP-CLOSE-AND-PERSONAL LOOK AT THE REFURBISHED AND UNIQUE VEHICLES.VILLA RICA MAYOR J. COLLINS ADDRESSED THE CROWD, SAYING HIS CITY WAS PROUD TO HOST THE GROUP. DOESNT IT SAY A LOT ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE CAN GATHER HERE AT THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF VILLA RICA AND CELEBRATE OUR COUNTRY, HE SAID. ITS A NIGHT THAT WERE THANKFUL TO BE VILLA RICANS, WERE THANKFUL TO BE AMERICANS AND WERE THANKFUL FOR THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH AND THEIR GRACIOUS HOSPITALITY HERE.THE CHURCHS PASTOR, KEVIN WILLIAMS, WHO IS ALSO A VETERAN OF THE MILITARY POLICE, SAID HE WAS AMAZED AT THE SIZE OF THE CROWD. IM PROUD WE COULD HAVE THEM HERE, HE SAID. WILLIAMS AND VOLUNTEERS AT THE CHURCH HANDED OUT BIBLES WITH A LETTER INSIDE, DATED JAN. 25, 1941, FROM PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT.I TAKE GREAT PLEASURE IN COMMENDING THE READING OF THE BIBLE TO ALL WHO SERVE IN THE ARMED FORCES, THE LETTER READS.THE TRIP THROUGH VILLA RICA RETRACED THE APPROXIMATE ROUTE TAKEN BY THE U.S.  ON THURSDAY AND HAD A POLICE ESCORT FROM THE DOUGLAS COUNTY LINE ON BANKHEAD HIGHWAY.IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIN, STATE SEN. MIKE DUGAN, R-CARROLLTON, SAID. THERE WERE MILITARY VEHICLES FROM MULTIPLE ERAS. I WAS AS EXCITED AS EVERYONE IN THE CROWD. I WAS ALSO VERY PROUD THAT THEY SAID OURS WAS THE LARGEST RECEPTION THEYVE RECEIVED YET. THE GROUP WAS EXPECTED THIS MORNING TO START BACK AGAIN ON ITS 3,300 MILE JOURNEY ONE THAT WILL TAKE 29 DAYS TO COMPLETE.IN 1920, THE ARMY DECIDED TO PLAN AND EXECUTE A MOTOR CONVOY OF VARIOUS MILITARY VEHICLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON THE NEWLY FORMED BANKHEAD HIGHWAY. THIS CONVOY WAS A FOLLOW-ON PROJECT TO THE 1919 U.S. ARMY TRANSCONTINENTAL MOTOR CONVOY THE FIRST-EVER CONVOY ACROSS THE U.S. ALONG THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY. THE ARMY WAS DETERMINED TO FURTHER ITS UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRACTICALITY OF A MOTORIZED TRANSPORT AND ITS PLACE IN THE ARMY. THAT CONVOY WAS COMMANDED BY COL. JOHN F. FRANKLIN. THE 1920 ROUTE BEGAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND ENDED AT BALBOA PARK, IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, 116 DAYS LATER.
745	LAST POST IN THIS THREAD I MENTIONED THAT I HAD OBTAINED SOME 'HONDURAN' MAHOGANY FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD ON THE CABINET. I WASN'T ENTIRELY PLEASED WITH THE MATERIAL I RECEIVED AS I HAD WANTED QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY, WHILE 7 OUT OF THE 10 BOARDS RECEIVED WERE NOT FITTING THAT DESCRIPTION AT ALL. I REALIZE NOW THAT QUARTERSAWN MAHOGANY IS NOT GENERALLY WHAT WAS BEING CUT - LOGS ARE INVARIABLY SAWN THROUGH AND THROUGH - AND THUS QS STOCK IS LESS COMMONLY AVAILABLE THAN I HAD THOUGHT. SO, TRYING TO OBTAIN MORE (IN BULK) IN THE HOPE OF SCORING SOME MORE QUARTERSAWN BOARDS WAS NOT LOOKING PROMISING. NONE OF THE RETAILERS I SPOKE WITH SEEMED EVEN WILLING TO DO A SORT FOR A FEW BOARDS, AND FAIR ENOUGH. AFTER FURTHER RUMINATION, I DECIDED IT WOULD BE BEST TO CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SPECIES FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD, A SPECIES THAT WAS TYPICALLY CUT FOR QUARTERSAWN FROM THE GET-GO AND WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD MATCH FOR THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE REST OF THE CABINET. I'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED WOODS SUCH AS MAHOGANY, BLACK CHERRY, AND SWISS PEAR WOOD FOR THE SECONDARY WOOD. NONE OF THOSE WERE LIKELY TO FIT THE REQUIREMENTS I HAD IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION, SO I KEPT LOOKING. I FINALLY CAME ACROSS A SUITABLE MATERIAL, AND IT IS BOTANICALLY RELATED TO BUBINGA (WHICH IS GUIBORTIA TESSMANII OR GUIBORTIA PELLAGRINIANA OR GUIBORTIA DEMEUSEI). THIS IS A WOOD CALLED SHEDUA, AKA OVANGKOL, WHICH COMES FROM THE SPECIES GUIBORTIA EHIE. THIS IS A SOMEWHAT SMALLER TREE THAN THOSE SPECIES FROM WHICH BUBINGA IS OBTAINED, HOWEVER IN MANY RESPECTS SHEDUA SHARES THE SAME WORKING QUALITIES AS BUBINGA. THE WOOD COMES FROM WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES LIKE GABON AND CAMEROON, AND THE TREE IS MORE COMMONLY UTILIZED FOR ITS GUM RESIN, CALLED CONGO COPAL, THAN ITS TIMBER. THE TIMBER IS NOT VERY COMMONLY AVAILABLE, AND DOES SEEM TO FIND A CERTAIN FAVOR AMONG THE GUITAR-MAKING COMMUNITY. HERE'S A GUITAR WITH A SHEDUA BACK: (FROM:HTTP://WWW.GUITARBENCH.COM/2012/01/04/SHEDUA-TONEWOOD-PROFILE/) AS YOU CAN SEE, IT HAS A MORE BROWNISH CAST THAN BUBINGA, BUT SHARES THE BLACK STREAKS. COMPARING SHEDUA'S MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WITH BUBINGA, IT IS VERY CLOSE INDEED, BEING VERY SLIGHTLY LIGHTER AND DENSER, A LITTLE LOWER IN VOLUMETRIC CHANGE DUE TO MOISTURE CONTENT CHANGE, A SLIGHT BIT SOFTER IN TERMS OF CRUSHING STRENGTH AND A HAIR STIFFER IN BENDING STRENGTH (MODULUS OF ELASTICITY). I IMAGINE, THEREFORE, THAT IT SHOULD HAVE FAIRLY SIMILAR WORKING QUALITIES TO BUBINGA. THIS IMAGE FROM HEARNE HARDWOODS SHOWS THE VARIED APPEARANCE OF SHEDUA BASED ON THE GRAIN ORIENTATION: AS IT SO HAPPENS, HEARNE WAS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN THE US WHICH HAD ANY STOCK OF SHEDUA AT ALL, LET ALONE QS AND/OR FIGURED STOCK. IN FACT, THEY HAD A DECENTLY SIZED STACK OF 12/4 MATERIAL, 6~12" WIDE, 16' LONG OR LONGER, AND SOME OF IT WAS QUARTERSAWN. CONSIDERING FEW OTHER RETAILERS HAVE ANY OF THIS MATERIAL, IT WAS AMAZING TO COME ACROSS SUCH NICE STOCK. THEY ALSO TOOK TIME TO REPLY TO MY EMAILS, AND SEND PICTURES, ONCE I HAD DEMONSTRATED SOLID INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL - - AND HAD GIVEN THEM MY CREDIT CARD INFO! THEY SEEM TO BE A WOOD RETAILER SPECIALIZING IN HIGH QUALITY AND RARE MATERIALS. THEY SENT ME SOME PICTURES OF A COUPLE OF BOARDS WHICH MATCHED THE REQUIREMENTS I GAVE THEM, SWABBED WITH ALCOHOL TO MAKE THE FIGURE A BIT CLEARER THOUGH NOT SHOWING THE TONE WHICH WILL BE OBTAINED WITH A PROPER FINISH: THEY WERE WONDERING IF I WAS SO DETERMINED TO HAVE QUARTERSAWN BECAUSE I WAS A LUTHIER, HOWEVER I LET THEM KNOW THEY WERE GUESSING WRONG. I DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC REASONS FOR WANTING QUARTERSAWN MATERIAL OF COURSE. THE GUY WHO SENT ME THE PICTURES STATED THAT THESE TWO BOARDS MIGHT BE THE NICEST IN THE ENTIRE PILE. I ASKED FOR A FOLLOW-UP PIC OF THE END GRAIN OF THE TWO BOARDS, TO CONFIRM THEY WERE WHAT I WANTED IN TERMS OF GRAIN ORIENTATION: AND THE OTHER BOARD, ABOUT 12" WIDE: THE STICKS ARE HARD TO SCALE UNTIL YOU NOTICE THAT A FORKLIFT IS DOING THE LIFTING.... THE STOCK LOOKED GOOD TO ME. THE PRICE WAS STEEP, AT $35/BOARD FOOT, SO EACH OF THOSE BOARDS WAS $1400.00, HOWEVER I WAS ABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE COST SOMEWHAT BY SELLING A PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY-ACQUIRED MAHOGANY OFF TO ANOTHER WOODWORKER IN MY BUILDING. I ORDERED THOSE TWO BOARDS AND THEY SHOULD BE AT MY SHOP IN ANOTHER 3~4 DAYS. I THINK THIS WOOD WILL GO VERY NICELY WITH THE BUBINGA USED FOR THE BULK OF THE CABINET: I THINK THE CAD REPRESENTATION OF THE SHEDUA IS APPROXIMATE AT BEST. IN RECENT DAYS I HAVE REVISED THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DIVIDERS ON THE LOWER BANK OF DRAWERS, MAKING THEM STRAIGHT INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM MATCH THE DRAWER CURVES, AND RECESSING THEM BACK SLIGHTLY - THIS FOR AMONG OTHER REASONS, TO INCREASE THE SHADOW LINE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE CURVED DRAWERS AND THE SURROUNDING FRAMEWORK: THE DIVIDER'S OUTER ARRISES WILL ADDITIONALLY BE CHAMFERED. THE DRAWERS THEMSELVES WILL HAVE A BEADED PERIMETER DETAIL, AND HAVE THE DRAWER SIDEWALL THROUGH- TENONS POKING OUT, NEITHER OF WHICH IS NOT ILLUSTRATED YET, AND THE HANDLE DESIGN FOR THE DRAWERS REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION. LIKEWISE, THE UPPER SET OF DRAWERS AND DOORS REMAINS JUST A FRONTAL PLANE AT THE MOMENT WITH NO ALLOWANCE FOR SET BACK, CHAMFERING, ETC.. GETTING THERE! THANKS FOR VISITING THE CARPENTRY WAY. GOT SOME MACHINE'S COMING SOON SO I AM WORKING ON GETTING MY SHOP READY FOR THAT - THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE SUBJECT OF THE NEXT POST.
746	THE WAY WE INTERACT WITH THE INTERNET IS CHANGING. AT WARP SPEED. WERE TRANSITIONING FROM THE DAYS OF GOING ONLINE USING DESKTOP COMPUTER TO AN AGE OF 24/7 INTERCONNECTIVITY, WHERE THE INTERNET IS BECOMING LESS LIKE A TOOL YOU POWER ON. . . AND MORE LIKE AN AMBIENT ELEMENT SIMILAR TO OXYGEN (AND SOME WOULD SAY, JUST AS CRITICAL). ITS JUST THERE. SENSING YOU. ASSISTING YOU. AND NOW; THANKS TO INNOVATIONS LIKE NANOSENSORS, BEING AN ACTUAL PART OF YOU. THE QUESTION IS. . . WHERE IS ALL OF THIS LEADING? SEVERAL YEARS AGO (OR ICE AGES IN TECH TIME), ACCESSING THE INTERNET MEANT LEAVING THE REAL WORLD SITTING DOWN AT A DESK AND GOING ONLINE. GOING TO A PLACE WHERE PASSWORDS UNLOCKED THE FRONT DOORS TO TREASURE TROVES OF INFORMATION AND ENTERTAINMENT. TODAY, THE LINES BETWEEN THE ONLINE AND OFFLINE WORLDS ARE BLURRING THANKS TO SMARTPHONES AND WEARABLE DEVICES NOT TO MENTION SMART APPLIANCES AND GROCERY AISLES THAT SEND COUPONS TO YOUR SMARTPHONE AS YOU WALK PAST PRODUCTS ON SALE. THE INTERNETS PLUMBING IS BECOMING LESS RELEVANT WITH REGARD TO HOW PEOPLE CONNECT TO IT. NOW, WE SIMPLY EXPECT THE INTERNET TO BE THERE WHEN WE PICK UP OUR SMARTPHONE OR TABLET. AND WERE ANNOYED BY HAVING TO ACTUALLY SEARCH OUT A HOT SPOT. SURE, THIS QUALIFIES AS A FIRST-WORLD PROBLEM, BUT BUSINESSES SHOULDNT THINK OF OFFERING WI-FI AS A PERK. THINK OF IT AS YOU DO ELECTRICITY PEOPLE EXPECT IT, FREE OF CHARGE. NOTHING TICKS OFF GUESTS AND CUSTOMERS LIKE NOT HAVING WI-FI ACCESS (OR HAVING TO PAY FOR IT). YOURE PROBABLY WELL AWARE OF THIS ALREADY. AFTER ALL, BUSINESSES THAT GET THIS WRONG DONT JUST STUB THEIR TOE. THEY SLIT THEIR OWN THROAT. SYNCING WITH YOUR DIGITAL LIFE THE PROGRESSION TOWARDS AN ALWAYS-ON INTERNET HAS LED EVERY MAN, WOMAN, CHILD AND GRUMPY CAT TO CREATE A ROBUST DIGITAL LIFE FOR THEMSELVES A DIGITAL LIFE THATS BECOMING LESS AND LESS DISTINGUISHABLE FROM REAL LIFE. YOUR SMARTPHONE ISNT AS MUCH A PHONE AS IT IS A LIFELINE TO YOUR CALENDARS AND CONTACTS. EMAILS AND IMS. NEWS FEEDS AND STREAMING PLAYLISTS. WEATHER FORECASTS, TRAFFIC PATTERN ALERTS, RESTAURANT RATINGSAND SO MUCH MORE. NATURALLY, WE WANT TO BRING ALL OF THE CONTENT COMPRISING OUR DIGITAL DNA WITH US WHEREVER WE GO. AND SAVVY COMPANIES ARE CATCHING ON QUICKLY. EVERY NEW CAR, TRUCK OR SUV IS COMING EQUIPPED WITH TECHNOLOGIES LIKE BLUETOOTH, SIRI EYES FREE, APPLE CAR PLAY OR ANDROID AUTO TECH THAT SEAMLESSLY SYNCS WITH YOUR SMARTPHONE AND LET YOU BRING YOUR DIGITAL LIFE ALONG FOR THE RIDE. SEAMLESSLY. THATS THE KEY. IN THE INTERNET EVERYWHERE ERA, TYPING AND TAPPING COMMANDS ON YOUR DEVICE IS, AS MY SONS MIGHT SAY, SO 2014. NOW, TECHNOLOGY IS ALLOWING YOUR SURROUNDINGS TO RESPOND INTELLIGENTLY TO YOUR MOVEMENTS. THINK OF A HOTEL SUITE WHERE THE LIGHTS COME ON AUTOMATICALLY AS YOU ENTER A ROOM. AND WHATEVER CHANNEL YOURE WATCHING (OR RATHER, CONTENT CHANNEL IS SO 2014) AUTOMATICALLY FOLLOWS YOU FROM ROOM TO ROOM. CONTEXT IS KING THIS KIND OF COGNITIVE COMPUTING IS ALREADY HERE. AN APP CALLED GOOGLE NOW PLUGS INTO YOUR EMAIL, CALENDARS, PREFERENCES, AND GEODATA TO PROACTIVELY SEND YOU DRIVING DIRECTIONS THAT AVOID A NEARBY TRAFFIC ACCIDENT AS YOURE WALKING TO YOUR CAR AFTER WORK. NO NEED TO ASK YOUR SMARTPHONE FOR DIRECTIONS. NO NEED TO TELL IT WHERE YOU LIVE. GOOGLE NOW ALREADY KNOWS. THE TRUTH IS, VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU, ME ALL OF US IS BEING RECORDED, SHARED AND ANALYZED. LIVING OFF THE GRID IN THE AGE OF BIG DATA IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO DO. THE COMPANIES THAT EMERGE AS LEADERS WILL BE THE ONES THAT EMBRACE THIS REALITY AND REIMAGINE BIG DATA AS INTIMATE DATA. TODAY, THERE IS ACCESS TO MORE DATA BETTER, MORE GRANULAR AND PRECISE DATA THAN EVER BEFORE. MARKETERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO NOT ONLY DISTINGUISH WHO THEIR MOST PROMISING PROSPECTS ARE, BUT TO INTERACT WITH THEM IN MORE RELEVANT WAYS AT GIVEN POINTS IN TIME. EXAMPLE: THE EVENING FORECAST CALLS FOR RAIN? HOTELS CAN MESSAGE THEIR GUESTS ABOUT TONIGHTS SPECIALS AT THE RESTAURANTS ON-PROPERTY. (FOR PURPOSES OF THIS BLUE-SKY DISCUSSION, PRIVACY CONCERNS WILL BE PUT ASIDE. ITS A CAN OF WORMS WE CAN OPEN IN ANOTHER COLUMN.) THE POSSIBILITIES OF CUSTOMIZING YOUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON A MORE PERSONAL LEVEL ARE ENDLESS. TO GET YOUR CREATIVE JUICES FLOWING, HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES THAT SHOW HOW THE IDEA OF INTIMATE DATA IS ALREADY BEING USED: LOOK WHATS TALKING YOURE JUST AS LIKELY TO RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM A DEVICE OR AN APPLIANCE THESE DAYS, AS YOU ARE A FACEBOOK FRIEND. A VALET PARKED YOUR HYUNDAI? YOUR CAR CAN AUTOMATICALLY MESSAGE YOU IF IT MOVES OUTSIDE OF A PREDEFINED AREA WHILE YOURE AT DINNER. RUNNING LOW ON BUTTER AT HOME? YOUR REFRIGERATOR CAN SEND YOU A MESSAGE AND ADD IT TO YOUR SMARTPHONES SHOPPING LIST (IN SOME CITIES, IT CAN AUTOMATICALLY PLACE ORDERS WITH NEARBY GROCERY STORES, TOO). HIGH-END RESORTS CAN USE THIS PREDICTIVE COMPUTING APPROACH TO CREATE SYSTEMS THAT RECOGNIZE WHEN A GUEST IS AT A DECISION POINT DURING HIS OR HER DAY, AND OFFER SUGGESTIONS BASED ON THE GUESTS PREFERENCES, SCHEDULE, TIME OF DAY, ETC. NANO INTELLIGENCE CLEVER CLOTHES (I.E., GARMENTS WITH SMALL SENSORS WOVEN INTO THEM) ARE CATCHING ON QUICKLY, AND NOT JUST WITH THE SIX-PACK ABS CROWD. A COMPANY NAMED ATHOS HAS CREATED A LINE OF SMART FITNESS APPAREL THAT RECORDS MUSCLE ACTIVITY, HEART RATE AND RESPIRATION IN REAL TIME WHILE YOURE WORKING OUT. BASED ON YOUR PERSONAL GOALS, IT TELLS YOU IF YOURE WORKING HARD ENOUGH, TRAINING THE RIGHT MUSCLE GROUPS, AND USING PROPER FORM TO ACHIEVE OPTIMAL RESULTS. MOVEMENT IS TRANSLATED INTO MEANING, SO YOU CAN FINE-TUNE YOUR WORKOUTS WITH PRECISION AND TAKE STEPS TOWARDS ACHIEVING BETTER RESULTS. FACE IT YOURE A VIP AND THEN THERES FACE FIRST, A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN LOS ANGELES THAT HAS DEVELOPED ADVANCED FACIAL RECOGNITION CAPABLE OF TAKING YOUR BUSINESS TO AN ENTIRELY NEW LEVEL OF PERSONALIZED SERVICE. THE TECHNOLOGY WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR AIRPORT SECURITY, BUT HAS EXPANDED INTO RETAIL AND IS ALREADY BEING USED IN EIGHT COUNTRIES. GAMING COMPANIES WILL APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO SPOT CON ARTISTS AND THOSE HEADLINING THE BLACK LIST UPON ENTERING THEIR CASINOS. USING CAMERAS MOUNTED NEAR THE ENTRANCES, FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IDENTIFIES THESE SCALAWAGS AND AUTOMATICALLY SENDS A MESSAGE TO SECURITY PERSONNEL. NO NEED FOR A CLUSTER OF SECURITY PEOPLE STARING AT COMPUTER MONITORS IN SOME SECRET BACK ROOMS. OF COURSE, THE SAME TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED TO RECOGNIZE HIGH ROLLERS AND OTHER VIPS AS WELL.

749	THE NEWS IS FROM JULY, BUTYESTERDAY WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HEARD THATA DIETARY SUPPLEMENT CALLED IRON DREAM , A SUPPLEMENT DESIGNED TO HELP AID SLEEP AND POST-WORKOUT RECOVERY MANUFACTURED BY MUSCLEPHARM , WAS PULLED FROM SHELVES IN EUROPEAFTER AUTHORITIES CLAIMED THAT THE PRODUCT CONTAINED 2,4-DINITROPHENOL, AKADNP (SOURCE: FORBES ). TO NO SURPRISE, THE COMPANY CLAIMED THAT THE SUSPECTED SUPPLEMENTS WERE COUNTERFEIT . DNP IS NOT SOMETHING TO SCREW WITH. ITS A HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICAL THAT WAS ONCE USED IN DIET PILLS DUE TO ITS ABILITY TO GREATLY INCREASE METABOLIC RATE THROUGH INCREASED HEAT PRODUCTION BY THE BODY. UNFORTUNATELY, ITS TOO GOOD, SO MUCH SO THAT EVEN A SLIGHT OVERDOSE CAN LEAD TO A COMBINATION OF HYPERTHERMIA, TACHYCARDIA, DIAPHORESIS AND TACHYPNOEA, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO DEATH. DESPITE THE RISK, PEOPLE STILL USE IT AND SOME DIE . UNDISCLOSED INGREDIENTS IN SUPPLEMENTS HAS BEEN ONE OF MANY PROBLEMS IN THE LARGELY UNREGULATED DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS INDUSTRY. WHAT CONCERNS ME MORE WITH THIS SPECIFIC CASE IS WHERE THE DNP WAS FOUND. OBVIOUSLY, IT DOESNT BELONG ANYWHERE NEAR THE HUMAN BODY, BUTMY EXPECTATION IS THAT A CHEMICAL KNOWN FOR AIDING WEIGHT LOSS WOULD BE USED IN A SUPPLEMENT GEARED TOWARD WEIGHT LOSS. MY BELIEF IS THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN NOT TAKE MORE THAN THE RECOMMENDED DOSES OF WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING BAD SIDE EFFECTS DUE THE HIGH AMOUNT OF STIMULANTS. THEREFORE, IF TRACE AMOUNTS OF DNP ARE IN A WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT, THERE IS LESS OF A CHANCE OF INGESTING A FATAL DOSE. IRON DREAM IS NOT A WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT. IT IS A NIGHT TIME SUPPLEMENT THAT CLAIMS TO AID IN RECOVERY AND MUSCLE GROWTH WHILE SLEEPING. IT IS A COMBINATION OF VITAMINS, HERBS,AND AMINO ACIDS. ITS ALSO A PRETTY SMALL SERVING SIZE (ANOTHER PROBLEM IN THIS INDUSTRY). MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS THAT PEOPLE COULD EASILY TAKE TWO TO THREE TIMES WHATS ON THE LABEL WITHOUT EXPERIENCING ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS, THAT IS, UNLESS ITS SPIKED WITH SOMETHING LIKE DNP. WHILE THE ADULTERATED PRODUCT WAS LIKELY A COUNTERFEIT, ITS A GOOD REMINDER OF CAVEAT EMPTOR, ESPECIALLY WHEN PURCHASING PRODUCTS THROUGH INTERNET-BASED BUSINESSES.
750	ON FRIDAY 4TH, MS CECILIA NAHN, ARGENTINA AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES, WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR THE HUFFINGTON POST, TITLED 'MALVINAS: ALL ARGENTINA IS SAYING IS GIVE DIALOGUE A CHANCE.' IN THE ARTICLE, AMBASSADOR NAHN DESCRIBED HOW OLD POLITICAL DISPUTES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE BEING SOLVED AS A RESULT OF 'A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE AND DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS.' AMB. NAHN WENT ON TO DETAIL HOW THE QUESTION OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS WAS AN '182-YEAR OLD SOVEREIGNTY DISPUTE WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM', IN REFERENCE TO THE REASSERTION OF BRITISH SOVEREIGNTY OF THE ISLANDS IN 1833. ARGENTINA REFERS TO THIS AS THE 'USURPATION' OF THE ISLANDS, AND CLAIMS THAT THE ENTIRE ARGENTINA POPULATION WAS FORCIBLY EJECTED FROM THE ISLANDS, ALTHOUGH RECORDS WITHIN THE ARGENTINE NATIONAL ARCHIVES SHOW THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA STATES REGULARLY THAT ITS CLAIM TO THE FALKLAND ISLANDS RUNS CONTINUOUSLY FROM THE 1820S. IT DOES NOT. THE ARGENTINE CLAIM TO SPANISH SUCCESSION, WHICH WAS NEVER ACCEPTED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM, WAS ENDED BY THE 'CONVENTION OF PEACE', RATIFIED IN 1850, AND FOR 34 YEARS ARGENTINA WAS SILENT OVER THE FALKLANDS, DURING WHICH TIME SEVERAL ARGENTINE LEADERS STATED THAT ARGENTINA HAD NO DISPUTE BRITAIN. THERE WAS A BRIEF FLURRY OF LETTERS IN THE 1880S BUT AFTER THAT, THE 'CLAIM' TO THE ISLANDS WAS DROPPED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA UNTIL THE 1930S. JOS MARA RUDA REIGNITED THE DISCUSSION OVER THE SO-CALLED 'CLAIM' TO THE ISLANDS IN 1965 WITH HIS IMPASSIONED (AND INACCURATE) SPEECH TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE III. THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT HAS PREVIOUSLY WORKED ALONGSIDE THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA, WITH JOINT ACCORDS ON A RANGE OF ECONOMIC ISSUES. ONE BY ONE, LARGELY UNDER A KIRCHNER REGIME, THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA HAS RENEGED ON THESE AGREEMENTS. IN THE DECADE OF KIRCHNERITE GOVERNMENT, ARGENTINA HAS WALKED AWAY FROM EVERY CHANCE OF DIALOGUE ON THE FALKLANDS. AMB. NAHN ACCUSES BRITAIN OF 'MILITARIZATION' OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC, BUT THE MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE ISLANDS IS A LEVEL APPROPRIATE TO DETER AGGRESSION BY ARGENTINA, AND IS PROPORTIONATE TO THE PERCEIVED THREAT. THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINE, WHILST DENYING ANY MILITARY DESIGNS ON THE ISLANDS, HAS SPENT THE PAST YEAR ATTEMPTING TO BROKER DEALS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT FROM SPAIN, SWEDEN, ISRAEL, RUSSIA AND CHINA TO BOLSTER ITS OWN FORCES, YET BITTERLY COMPLAINS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES (INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW SCHOOL) IN THE FALKLANDS. THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF ALL PEOPLES IN ENSHRINED IN THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER, AND SAFEGUARDS THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO DETERMINE ONE'S OWN POLITICAL FUTURE, AND ANY ALLEGIANCES THEREIN. WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, HAVE A RIGHT TO A SAY IN OUR OWN POLITICAL FUTURE, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS ASSURED US THAT THERE CAN BE NO DISCUSSIONS ON SOVEREIGNTY WITH ARGENTINA UNLESS WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, SO WISH. AND WE EXPRESSED OUR WISH IN OUR HISTORIC REFERENDUM IN MARCH 2013. THIS WAS INTERNATIONALLY OVERSEEN AND SAW 99.8% OF THOSE WHO VOTED FREELY CHOOSING TO RETAIN OUR CURRENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UK. AMB. NAHN CLAIMED THAT THE UK REFUSES TO ENTER NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT ISSUES OTHER THAN SOVEREIGNTY. BUT IT IS UNTRUE. THE UK HAS SIMPLY SAID THAT ISLANDERS NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY DISCUSSIONS, AND WE HAVE EXTENDED NUMEROUS INVITATIONS TO TALK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA. THESE GO UNACKNOWLEDGED.  TIMERMAN REFUSED TO ATTEND BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE AND I, AS ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT, WERE PRESENT. THE EMPTY CHAIR AT THAT MEETING SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT THE SINCERITY OF ARGENTINA'S CALL FOR DIALOGUE. AMB. NAHN CLAIMS TO SEEK DIALOGUE WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM TO 'NEGOTIATE' OVER THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, YET THE ARGENTINE CONSTITUTION (REVISED IN 1994) PLAINLY STATES 'THE RECOVERY OF SAID TERRITORIES [FALKLAND ISLANDS, SOUTH GEORGIA & SOUTH SANDWICH ISLANDS] AND THE FULL EXERCISE OF SOVEREIGNTY [...] CONSTITUTES A PERMANENT AND UNRELINQUISHABLE GOAL OF THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE.' ARGENTINA CANNOT, AND WILL NOT, SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN FULL CONTROL OF THE FALKLANDS, AND THEREFORE ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ISLANDS ISN'T A 'NEGOTIATION' AT ALL - WHEN ARGENTINA SAYS 'DIALOGUE' IT REALLY MEANS 'DELIVER THE FALKLANDS TO US.' THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH ARGENTINA ABOUT MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST, YET IT IS ARGENTINA WHO CONSISTENTLY IGNORES OUR INVITATIONS WHILST CRYING OUT FOR CONVERSATION. ARGENTINA'S DISINGENUOUS CALL FOR DIALOGUE IS IN REALITY A CALL TO COLONISE OUR COUNTRY, SEIZE OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND DENY OUR RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION. -- THIS FEED AND ITS CONTENTS ARE THE PROPERTY OF THE HUFFINGTON POST, AND USE IS SUBJECT TO OUR TERMS.

753	WASHINGTON (CNN) FIVE-TIME GRAMMY AWARD WINNER MALIK YUSEF, A SPOKEN-WORD POET AND LONGTIME PRODUCER/CO-WRITER FOR KANYE WESTS G.O.O.D MUSIC, HAS DUBBED POPE FRANCIS THE FIRST HIP-HOP POPE. YUSEF, ALONG WITH OTHER ARTISTS, PERFORMED AT THE MORAL ACTION ON CLIMATE JUSTICE RALLY IN WASHINGTON ON THURSDAY, AS POPE FRANCIS MAKES HIS HISTORIC VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES. ME AND MY FRIENDS, WE AFFECTIONATELY CALL POPE FRANCIS THE FIRST HIP-HOP POPE,' YUSEF TOLD CNN. HE DOES THINGS THAT THE HIP-HOP CULTURE GRAVITATES TO HES A FLY PERSON, HE SPEAKS HIS MIND, HE SPEAKS HIS HEART. THATS WHAT HIP-HOP IS. MOST RECENTLY, YUSEF CO-WROTE EIGHT SONGS ON WESTS SIXTH STUDIO RELEASE YEEZUS, WHICH CHARTED #1 ON BILLBOARD, AND HE HAS WON GRAMMY AWARDS FOR HIS WORK ON WESTS MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY, WESTS 2011 HIT ALL OF THE LIGHTS, JOHN LEGENDS 2010 ALBUM WAKE UP! AND WESTS ICONIC 2005 ALBUM LATE REGISTRATION. OVER THE LAST MONTH, YUSEF A SURROGATE FOR THE HIP-HOP CAUCUS HAS BEEN ON THE ACT OF CLIMATE NATIONAL BUS TOUR TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS POPE, ESPECIALLY OVER ANY OTHER POPE, REALLY TALKS ABOUT HUMAN-BASED ISSUES OUTSIDE OF RELIGION, YUSEF SAID. SO YOU DONT HAVE TO ACTUALLY BE A CATHOLIC OR A CHRISTIAN TO IDENTITY WITH POPE FRANCIS. POPE FRANCIS ISSUED AN URGENT CALL TO ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE SPEAKING TO THOUSANDS ON THE SOUTH LAWN OF THE WHITE HOUSE WEDNESDAY. ACCEPTING THE URGENCY, IT SEEMS CLEAR TO ME ALSO THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A PROBLEM, WHICH CAN NO LONGER BE LEFT TO A FUTURE GENERATION, FRANCIS SAID. WHEN IT COMES TO THE CARE OF OUR COMMON HOME, WE ARE LIVING AT A CRITICAL MOMENT OF HISTORY. WE STILL HAVE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGES NEEDED TO BRING ABOUT A SUSTAINABLE AND INTEGRAL DEVELOPMENT, FOR WE KNOW THAT THINGS CAN CHANGE. POPE FRANCIS, WHO ADDRESSED A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON THURSDAY MORNING, MADE SOME CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS UNEASY WITH HIS PROGRESSIVE VIEWS ON CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT YUSEF, WHO CALLED CLIMATE CHANGE THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE HAVE ON THE PLANET EARTH, SAID THAT IT IS LUDICROUS TO CHARACTERIZE CLIMATE CHANGE AS A POLITICAL ISSUE. HE RE-MIXED WESTS 2015 HIT ALL DAY, WHICH HE CO-PRODUCED, TO SPEAK OUT ON ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AS WELL AS THE #BLACKLIVESMATTER MOVEMENT. POLITICS IS LEGISLATION. YOU CANT LEGISLATE THE EARTH. YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE EARTH. THAT IS YOUR JOB AS A HUMAN BEING BORN TO A PLANET, YUSEF SAID, CALLING PEOPLE FRANCIS AN AMAZING PERSON FOR SPEAKING OUT. YOU CANT TAKE UNFALRLY AND UNJUSTLY YOUR PORTION (OF THE PLANET), PLUS OTHER PEOPLES PORTIONS AWAY FROM THEM. ITS A NON-POLITICAL ISSUE. I DONT THINK THAT SHOULD BE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT, YUSEF SAID. ITS AN ERRONEOUS CHARGE TO SAY OH, (POPE FRANCIS) IS GETTING POLITICAL BECAUSE HES TALKING ABOUT THE PLANET WE LIVE ON. BE SERIOUS! YUSEF HAS ADDRESSED CLIMATE CHANGE IN HIS MUSIC AND SPOKEN WORD POETRY AND HAS COLLABORATED OVER THE YEARS WITH COMMON, RAHEEM DEVAUGHN, MAROON 5S ADAM LEVINE AND RAPPER THE GAME, AMONG OTHERS. POPE FRANCIS DOES ALL THE THINGS THAT OTHER POPES WOULDNT TOUCH, YUSEF SAID. AND I THINK HIP-HOP MUSIC IS THAT BRASH, THAT AVANT-GARDE ASPECT THAT WE JUST GO HARD. AND ANYBODY IN HIP-HOP THEYRE ALL VERY, VERY BRAVE AND VERY BRAZEN AND THIS POPE IS THE SAME WAY.
754	INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, WHICH MEASURES OUTPUT IN THE MANUFACTURING, UTILITIES AND MINING SECTORS, FELL A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED 0.4% IN AUGUST FROM JULY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE SAID TUESDAY. IT WAS THE SIXTH TIME IN EIGHT MONTHS THAT THE MEASURE FELL FROM THE PREVIOUS MONTH. CAPACITY UTILIZATION, WHICH MEASURES INDUSTRIAL SLACK, FELL TO 77.6% IN AUGUST FROM 78% IN JULY. ECONOMISTS SURVEYED BY THE WALL STREET JOURNAL HAD ANTICIPATED A PRODUCTION DROP OF 0.2% IN AUGUST AND CAPACITY UTILIZATION OF 77.8%. MEANWHILE, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FOR JULY WAS REVISED UP TO A 0.9% RISE FROM AN INITIAL ESTIMATE OF 0.6% GROWTH. MANUFACTURING OUTPUT, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR ALMOST THREE-QUARTERS OF OVERALL INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, FELL BY 0.5%, DRIVEN BY A 6.4% DROP IN PRODUCTION OF AUTOS AND AUTO PARTS AFTER AN INCREASE IN JULY OF MORE THAN 10%. "THAT DECLINE ONLY PARTIALLY REVERSED THE...JUMP IN MOTOR VEHICLE OUTPUT IN JULY, WHICH WE EXPLAINED AT THE TIME WAS DUE TO A SEASONAL DISTORTION CREATED BECAUSE FEWER PLANTS CLOSE DOWN FOR ANNUAL SUMMER RETOOLINGS NOW, " SAID PAUL ASHWORTH, AN ECONOMIST AT CAPITAL ECONOMICS, IN AN ANALYST NOTE. "THE 1.6% MONTHLY GAIN IN MACHINERY OUTPUT LAST MONTH WAS PRETTY ENCOURAGING AND MOTOR VEHICLE OUTPUT IS STILL UP SIGNIFICANTLY ON WHERE IT WAS IN JUNE. PRODUCTION OF NON-AUTO BUSINESS EQUIPMENT AND CONSUMER GOODS BOTH ROSE 0.4%, ALTHOUGH SOME ECONOMISTS WEREN'T IMPRESSED. "THE TRUE AUGUST STORY IS BURIED IN THE TALLIES WHICH EXCLUDE MOTOR VEHICLES AND PARTS; BOTH TOTAL PRODUCTION AND MANUFACTURING OUTPUT WERE DEAD FLAT IN AUGUST," WROTE IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT ECONOMIST MICHAEL MONTGOMERY IN A CLIENT NOTE. MANUFACTURING OUTPUT WAS UP 1.4% IN AUGUST FROM A YEAR EARLIER. OVERALL MINING OUTPUT FELL BY 0.6%, POTENTIALLY REFLECTING LOW ENERGY PRICES AND SLOWING COMMODITY DEMAND FROM CHINA. A RELATIVELY STRONG DOLLAR, WHICH MAKES EXPORTS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR OVERSEAS BUYERS, HAS ALSO CHECKED EXPANSION IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR. "WITHIN THE MINING SECTOR, OIL- AND GAS-WELL DRILLING EXPANDED 1.5% [ON A MONTHLY BASIS], BUT THIS WAS OFFSET BY SOFTNESS ELSEWHERE. ON NET, MANUFACTURING AND INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT IN THE U.S. REMAINS LACKLUSTER AND WE DO NOT EXPECT A SHARP TURNAROUND FOR THE SECTOR," SAID JESSE HURWITZ, AN ECONOMIST AT BARCLAYS, IN A NOTE TO CLIENTS. THE U.S. ECONOMY HAS BROADCAST MIXED SIGNALS ABOUT ITS HEALTH IN THE YEAR TO DATE. HIRING HAS BEEN STEADY, MANY HOUSING MARKETS HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENING, AND LOW GASOLINE PRICES HAVE PUT A FEW EXTRA DOLLARS IN AMERICAN CONSUMERS' WALLETS. BUT WAGE GROWTH AND CONSUMER SPENDING HAVE YET TO SHOW PROLONGED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT, AND THE ECONOMIC TURMOIL AROUND THE WORLD HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT WHERE OVERALL DEMAND FROM BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS IS HEADING.

755	BY: LEANNE ELY LAST WEEK, I STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE S WORD WHEN I WROTE ABOUT HOW FREEZER MEALS CAN GET A NUTRITIOUS MEAL ON THE TABLE FOR THOSE UPCOMING SCHOOL NIGHTS. BUT IF YOU CANT SEE YOURSELF USING THE FREEZER TO HELP YOU PLAN AND PREPARE MEALS AHEAD OF TIME, YOURE NOT TOTALLY SUNK. NOT IF YOU HAVE A SLOW COOKER! THAT SLOW COOKER WILL HELP YOU GET THOSE SCHOOL NIGHT SUPPERS ON THE TABLE WITH A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF EFFORT. YOU CAN USE YOUR SLOW COOKER REGARDLESS OF YOUR LIFESTYLE. WHETHER YOUVE GONE PALEO, PRIMAL, GLUTEN-FREE, OR IF YOU FOLLOW THE STANDARD AMERICAN DIET, YOUR SLOW COOKER CAN BE WORKING HARDER FOR YOU THAN IT CURRENTLY IS. AND REALLY, WHATS BETTER THAN HAVING A DELICIOUS HOT MEAL READY FOR YOU AT THE END OF THE DAY? WE HAVE MANY RECIPES THAT FOCUS ON THE SLOW COOKER BECAUSE EVERYONE LOVES THE CONVENIENCE OF THIS HARD-WORKING APPLIANCE, BUT INSPIRATION CAN BE HARD TO COME BY! I MAKE ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN MY SLOW COOKER FROM CLASSIC NAVY BEANS AND BEEF STEW TO CHILI VERDE PORK AND TURKEY POT PIE. BUT WHEN MY KIDS WERE YOUNG, IN THE WEEKS FOLLOWING THEIR RETURN TO SCHOOL, I MADE A LOT OF SOUP. IT WAS A LIFE SAVER! NOT ONLY IS IT PRACTICALLY EFFORTLESS TO MAKE SOUP IN THE CROCK FOR A HEALTHY SUPPER, BUT ITS EASY TO HEAT UP AND PACK IN LUNCHES THE NEXT DAY. IF YOU HAVE A FAVORITE SOUP RECIPE, ADAPT IT FOR THE SLOW COOKER WITH THE FOLLOWING TIPS. TOP TIPS FOR MAKING SOUP IN THE SLOW COOKER BROWN THE MEAT. YES THE CROCKPOT WILL COOK YOUR SOUP JUST FINE WITHOUT YOU BROWNING THE MEAT, BUT THIS STEP WILL YIELD TASTIER RESULTS. CUT INGREDIENTS UNIFORMLY. WHEN YOU CUT YOUR VEGETABLES ROUGHLY THE SAME SIZE, THEY WILL COOK EVENLY. WATCH YOUR LIQUIDS. YOU WONT NEED AS MUCH LIQUID AS YOUR TRADITIONAL SOUP RECIPE CALLS FOR. JUST ADD ENOUGH TO COVER THE VEGGIES BY ABOUT HALF AN INCH. IF YOURE LEFT WITH TOO MUCH LIQUID AT THE END OF YOUR COOKING TIME, REMOVE THE CROCKPOT LID 30 MINUTES BEFORE YOU PLAN TO SERVE DINNER AND IT WILL EVAPORATE. LAYER PROPERLY. INGREDIENTS THAT TAKE THE LONGEST TO COOK SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE CROCKPOT FIRST. ROOT VEGETABLES SHOULD BE PLACED ON THE BOTTOM WHERE THEYLL HAVE MORE DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE HEATING ELEMENT OF THE SLOW COOKER. NEXT, ADD YOUR MEATS, SPICES AND ONIONS. VEGGIES LIKE CAULIFLOWER AND BROCCOLI CAN GO IN NEXT. FINALLY, ADD YOUR LIQUID BEFORE COVERING THE CROCKPOT AND TURNING IT ON. SOME INGREDIENTS DONT TAKE MUCH TIME TO COOK, SO YOULL WANT TO ADD THEM IN DURING THE LAST HOUR OF COOK TIME. (THINGS LIKE PASTA, MILK, PEAS, BELL PEPPERS AND SPINACH WOULD FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY.) AND ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE YOU COVERED WHEN IT COMES TO CROCK COOKER RECIPES. IM GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE HERE TODAY, BUT OUR CROCK COOKER CLUB IS FULL OF DELICIOUS OPTIONS!

757	SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- (MARKETWIRED) -- 09/08/15 -- " EARLOBE REPAIR IS A POPULAR PROCEDURE AMONG BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AT MY PRACTICE," STATES SAN FRANCISCO PLASTIC SURGEON KAREN HORTON, MD . "WOMEN USUALLY WISH TO ADDRESS STRETCHED OUT EAR PIERCINGS OR TORN EARLOBES, AND MEN OFTEN WANT TO CORRECT SIZEABLE HOLES RESULTING FROM LARGE DISCS -- KNOWN AS GAUGES -- INSERTED IN THEIR EARLOBES THAT WERE ONCE DESIRED BUT NO LONGER FIT WITH THEIR CURRENT LOOK. IN ADDITION TO THESE CONCERNS, MANY MEN AND WOMEN ALSO SEE ME FOR KELOID SCARS IN THE EARS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED FROM PAST PIERCINGS, INFECTIONS, OR TRAUMA." FOR INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN EARLOBE REPAIR, DR. HORTON SAYS SHE FIRST OBTAINS A COMPLETE MEDICAL HISTORY AND CONDUCTS A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE TARGETED AREA DURING AN INITIAL CONSULTATION. SHOULD SHE DETERMINE THAT EARLOBE CORRECTION SURGERY WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OPTION FOR THE PATIENT'S UNIQUE NEEDS -- AS OPPOSED TO NONSURGICAL EARLOBE REJUVENATION VIA FILLERS -- THE PROCEDURE IS DISCUSSED IN EXTENSIVE DETAIL, AND A SURGICAL DATE IS SCHEDULED IF THE PATIENT WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED. ON THE DAY OF SURGERY, THE SAN FRANCISCO PLASTIC SURGEON NOTES THAT THE TREATMENT AREA IS MARKED, AND THE PATIENT VISUALLY CONFIRMS WHAT IS TO BE PERFORMED. NEXT, LOCAL ANESTHESIA IS ADMINISTERED, AND THE PROCEDURE IS CONDUCTED UNDER MAGNIFICATION TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF ACCURACY AND PRECISION. "DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION," DR. HORTON WRITES IN A RECENT BLOG POST OVERVIEWING EARLOBE REPAIR , "EXCESS SCARRING, SKIN, OR TISSUE IS REMOVED, AND THE REMAINING EARLOBE TISSUE IS 'LOCALLY REARRANGED' TO CREATE A MORE NORMAL APPEARING EARLOBE." IF A PIERCING IS STILL DESIRED AFTER THE OPERATION, THE EARLOBE CAN ALSO BE RE-PIERCED AT THE TIME OF SURGERY. IN REGARD TO RECOVERY FROM EARLOBE REPAIR , DR. HORTON EXPLAINS THAT SOME TEMPORARY SWELLING AND/OR BRUISING CAN BE EXPECTED INITIALLY, BUT THESE SIDE EFFECTS SHOULD DIMINISH RELATIVELY QUICKLY. "DOWNTIME IS TYPICALLY MINIMAL, WITH MOST INDIVIDUALS RETURNING TO WORK AND/OR NORMAL DAILY ROUTINES THE DAY AFTER THEIR PROCEDURE. THAT SAID, PATIENTS ARE ADVISED TO AVOID STRENUOUS ACTIVITIES AND RIGOROUS EXERCISE FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE TO TWO WEEKS IN ORDER TO HELP ENSURE PROPER HEALING." ULTIMATELY, WHEN PERFORMED BY AN EXPERIENCED BOARD CERTIFIED PLASTIC SURGEON, DR. HORTON STATES THAT EARLOBE REPAIR CAN BE AN EXCEPTIONALLY GRATIFYING PROCEDURE FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS, ENABLING THEM TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR EARLOBES. ABOUT KAREN HORTON, MD CERTIFIED BY THE AMERICAN BOARD OF PLASTIC SURGERY, DR. HORTON OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF COSMETIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE PROCEDURES FOR THE BREASTS, FACE, AND BODY, AS WELL AS SEVERAL NONSURGICAL SKIN CARE AND MED-SPA TREATMENTS. SHE IS A FELLOW OF BOTH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS AND THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS OF CANADA, AND SHE REMAINS ACTIVE IN THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS, THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS, AND VARIOUS OTHER PRESTIGIOUS MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS. ABOVE ALL, DR. HORTON IS DEVOTED TO ENSURING EVERY PATIENT RECEIVES THE SAFEST, MOST EFFECTIVE CARE POSSIBLE FOR THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS AND DESIRES.

758	NEW YORK -- WITH ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER MATTEO RENZI WATCHING INTENTLY, FLAVIA PENNETTA BECAME THE SECOND ITALIAN WOMAN TO WIN A GRAND SLAM TITLE, EDGING FED CUP TEAMMATE ROBERTA VINCI 7-6 (4), 6-2 ON SATURDAY IN THE US OPEN FINAL.THE UNSEEDED VINCI COULDN'T CAPITALIZE ON THE MOMENTUM THAT CAME FROM A STUNNING SEMIFINAL UPSET OF NO. 1 SEED SERENA WILLIAMS ON FRIDAY, THE DAY SHE CALLED THE BEST OF HER LIFE.THUS THE 26TH-SEEDED PENNETTA CAPTURED HER FIRST MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIP, AT ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM, BECOMING THE OLDEST FIRST-TIME GRAND SLAM CHAMPION EVER. INSTEAD OF THE SINGLE-SEASON SLAM THAT SO MANY ENVISIONED FOR WILLIAMS, IT WAS ANOTHER 33-YEAR-OLD HOLDING THE STERLING SILVER TROPHY AFTERWARD.AFTER A LONG EMBRACE WITH VINCI AT THE NET, PENNETTA SPRINTED TO HER BOX, THANKED HER COACHES AND KISSED FIANCE FABIO FOGNINI, WHO FLEW BACK FROM ITALY TO BE AT THE MATCH.AT THE TROPHY PRESENTATION, PENNETTA FLOORED THE SELLOUT CROWD BY ANNOUNCING SHE PLANS TO RETIRE AT THE END OF THE YEAR."BEFORE I STARTED THIS TOURNAMENT ONE MONTH AGO, I TOOK A BIG DECISION IN MY LIFE. THIS IS THE WAY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY GOODBYE TO TENNIS," SHE SAID.PENNETTA SAID SHE WILL PLAY TOURNAMENTS IN BEIJING AND WUHAN, CHINA. IF SHE QUALIFIES, SHE WOULD ALSO PLAY IN THE WTA YEAR-END EVENT IN SINGAPORE."BUT FOR SURE THIS ONE WAS THE LAST NEW YORK FOR ME," SHE SAID. "FOR SURE."VINCI'S STUNNING THREE-SET VICTORY OVER WILLIAMS WAS WIDELY REGARDED AS THE GREATEST UPSET EVER AT THAT LATE STAGE OF A GRAND SLAM. AT THE OUTSET OF THE TOURNAMENT, VINCI WAS A 300-1 SHOT TO WIN THE MAJOR.IN RETROSPECT, THE 32-YEAR-OLD'S LOSS IN THE FINAL WAS ALMOST PREDICTABLE. ACCORDING TO FIVETHIRTYEIGHT.COM, OF THE EIGHT WOMEN WHO SCORED SIMILAR UPSETS IN GRAND SLAM EVENTS, ONLY ONE WENT ON TO WIN HER NEXT MATCH."IT WAS TOUGH," VINCI SAID. "PAST 24 HOURS WITH A LOT OF THINGS ON MY MIND. I WAS A LITTLE BIT TIRED, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST SET."I TRY TO DO MY BEST, BUT FLAVIA PLAYED UNBELIEVABLE, GREAT MATCH. I JUST HAVE TO SAY CONGRATS TO HER."PENNETTA'S SUCCESS WAS REMINISCENT OF ITALIAN FRANCESCA SCHIAVONE'S UNEXPECTED TITLE AT ROLAND GARROS FIVE YEARS AGO. IT WAS THE ONLY GRAND SLAM SINGLES TITLE OF HER CAREER -- ON THE CUSP OF HER 30TH BIRTHDAY.MUCH HAS BEEN MADE OF THE AWKWARD, EMOTIONAL NATURE OF THE MATCHES PLAYED BETWEEN SERENA AND VENUS WILLIAMS. SIMILARLY, THIS MATCH COULDN'T HAVE BEEN EASY EITHER. PENNETTA AND VINCI GREW UP WITHIN 30 MILES OF EACH OTHER IN ITALY AND BEGAN PLAYING EACH OTHER AT THE AGE OF 10. THEY WERE DOUBLES PARTNERS IN MORE THAN 50 JUNIOR EVENTS.THIS WAS ONLY THE SIXTH TIME THAT TWO FIRST-TIME FINALISTS FACED OFF IN GRAND SLAM, AND THEY EARNED THEIR WAY THERE. VINCI, OF COURSE, BEAT WILLIAMS, AND PENNETTA ELIMINATED NO. 5 PETRA KVITOVA IN THE QUARTERFINALS AND NO. 2 SEED SIMONA HALEP IN THE SEMIFINALS.VINCI SAVED SIX BREAK-POINT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FIFTH GAME OF THE MATCH BUT WAS BROKEN ON THE SEVENTH. SHE GOT THE BREAK BACK IN THE EIGHTH GAME, AND THE OPENING SET PROGRESSED TO A TIEBREAKER.THE KEY POINT CAME WITH PENNETTA SERVING AT 5-4. VINCI, OUT OF CHARACTER, SENT A FOREHAND SCREAMING LONG ON A SECOND SERVE. PENNETTA CONVERTED HER FIRST SET POINT WITH A 95 MPH SERVE OUT WIDE THAT VINCI DUMPED INTO THE NET.THE LAST 10 WOMEN TO WIN THE FIRST SET OF A GRAND SLAM SINGLES FINAL HAD GONE ON TO WIN THE MATCH. AT THE US OPEN THE NUMBER WAS 20.MAKE THAT 21.GREG GARBER, ESPN.COM
759	WENN.COM SEP 16, 2015 , LAST UPDATED: 9:07 AM ET ACTRESS MINDY KALING HAS REVEALED SHE HAD A SECRET FLING WITH ONE OF U.S. LEADER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAS TOP AIDES. THE MINDY PROJECT STAR RELEASED HER SECOND MEMOIR, WHY NOT ME? ON TUESDAY, AND AMONG THE INTERESTING ANECDOTES ABOUT HER PERSONAL LIFE IN THE BOOK IS A STORY ABOUT A ROMANCE WITH AN UNNAMED WHITE HOUSE STAFFER. KALING CALLS HER FORMER PARAMOUR WILL, DESCRIBING THE MYSTERIOUS MAN AS A TALL TENNESSEE NATIVE WITH BLONDE HAIR AND GLASSES. LIKE KALING, WHO GRADUATED FROM DARTMOUTH COLLEGE, HE IS ALSO AN IVY LEAGUE GRADUATE, AND HE TRAVELS EVERYWHERE WITH THE PRESIDENT. KALING SAYS SHE AND HER EX WERE INTRODUCED TWO YEARS AGO AT A NEW YORK CITY FUNDRAISER PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ATTENDING, AND AFTER HER INITIAL ATTRACTION TO HIM, SHE AGREED TO LET HIM HAVE HER EMAIL ADDRESS. THE TWO CORRESPONDED WITH EACH OTHER FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND THEN SHE WAS INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO MEET THE PRESIDENT. SHE WRITES, THAT WAS A MOMENT WHEN I REALIZED HOW COOL MY LIFE IS. I WAS TRYING TO HIT ON A GUY AND WAS BEING CBLOCKED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SOON, KALING FOUND HERSELF RECEIVING INVITATIONS TO A NUMBER OF INCREDIBLE EVENTS IN WASHINGTON D.C., INCLUDING HOLIDAY PARTIES, EASTER EGG HUNTS AND THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER. SHE ALSO REVEALS SHE AND WILL HAD A LATE NIGHT OF PASSION THAT FINALLY CONFIRMED THEIR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP, WRITING, WILL SPENT THE NIGHT. THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE WAS LEAVING, HE WAS SO SHY AND ADORABLE IN MY FOYER, THAT WHEN I CLOSED THE DOOR, I COVERED MY MOUTH WITH MY HAND TO STIFLE MY SCREAM. UNFORTUNATELY DISTANCE GOT IN THE WAY OF THEIR ROMANCE AND IT ENDED SOON AFTER THEIR MAGICAL NIGHT TOGETHER. KALING RECALLS, WILL AND I CONTINUED TO TEXT AND EMAIL, AND WOULD TRY TO SEE EACH OTHER, BUT IT NEVER SEEMED TO CRYSTALLIZE INTO ANYTHING MORE ALL I HAD TO DO NOW WAS MOVE ON. IN THE WORDS OF BOTH MARIAH CAREY AND TAYLOR SWIFT, I KNEW I COULD SHAKE IT OFF. KALING PREVIOUSLY DATED HER THE OFFICE CO-STAR B.J. NOVAK AND ACTOR/COMEDIAN DAVID BARTON HARRIS.
760	DRIVE TO THE GROCERY STORE, WATER YOUR PLANTS. THE 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI IS THE JAPANESE AUTOMAKERS FIRST PRODUCTION HYDROGEN FUEL CELL SEDAN AND IS CLOSE TO BEING LAUNCHED IN CALIFORNIA. THE MIRAI, ALONG WITH THE HYUNDAI TUCSON AND HONDA FCV, ARE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES (FCEV) THAT USES COMPRESSED HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IN A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT CREATES ELECTRICITY TO POWER A COMPACT MOTOR, WHICH IN TURN DRIVES THE FRONT WHEELS. THE ONLY EMISSION IS WATER VAPOR. THE TOYOTA MIRAI PROMISES A 312-MILE RANGE BETWEEN HYDROGEN FILL-UPS, ROOM FOR FOUR PASSENGERS AND A REFUELING TIME OF THREE TO FOUR MINUTES (H70/700 BAR). UNLIKE A PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE, THERES NO WAITING HOURS FOR THE BATTERY TO RECHARGE. WITH A TOP SPEED OF 111 MPH AND ZERO-TO-60 MPH TIMES OF LESS THAN 10 SECONDS, PERFORMANCE IS SIMILAR TO AN EV SUCH AS THE NISSAN LEAF AND VW E-GOLF. A LITTLE LARGER THAN ITS HYBRID COUSINS, THE PRIUS AND CT 200H, THE MIRAI IS BUILT ON A PLATFORM THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY USED BY THE RETIRED LEXUS HS 250H. SIZE MATTERS AND EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE PROPULSION SYSTEM, BATTERY, AND TWO LIGHTWEIGHT CARBON FIBER REINFORCED PLASTIC, HIGH-PRESSURE HYDROGEN TANKS HAD TO FIT. MANY COMPONENTS OF THE ELECTRIC-DRIVE SYSTEM ARE SHARED WITH TOYOTAS HYBRID DRIVETRAIN WITH THE BENEFIT OF KEEPING BUILD COSTS DOWN. DRIVING IMPRESSIONS PROMISING A PUNCH OF 152 HORSEPOWER AND 247 LB-FT OF TORQUE, THE ENGINE FEELS REASONABLY STRONG AND ALSO HAS A POWER MODE THAT RELEASES MORE HYDROGEN INTO THE FUEL CELL STACK. EVEN THOUGH IT SHARES ELECTRIC POWERTRAIN BITS FROM THE PRIUS, THE MIRAI IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN ITS HYBRID COUSIN. CABIN MATERIALS ARE NICER THAN A PRIUS AND IT HAS MANY PREMIUM FEATURES THAT YOU WONT FIND IN A PRIUS. PLUS, THIS IS A HEAVIER CAR THAT WEIGHS 1,006 POUNDS MORE THAN A REGULAR PRIUS, AND YOU FEEL THE EXTRA WEIGHT PUSHING THE CAR INTO CORNERS. REALISTICALLY, THE MIRAI HAS PLENTY OF PEP FOR A CAR WHERE PERFORMANCE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A SELLING POINT. MASHING THE THROTTLE TO THE FLOOR FROM A DEAD- OR ROLLING-STOP INVIGORATES THE MIRAI WITH INSTANTANEOUS TORQUE RESPONSE FROM THE ELECTRIC MOTOR. TRYING TO COAX MORE ACCELERATION FOR PASSING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IS A SLOW AND STEADY PROCESS A BEHAVIOR THAT IS TYPICAL WITH HYBRIDS AND EVS. TOYOTA THINKS MOST BUYERS OF THE MIRAI WILL BE MORE APPRECIATIVE OF THE SMOOTH, COMFORTABLE RIDE OVER A SPORTY EDGE. I DROVE THE 2016 MIRAI FOR A DAY AND INTO THE NIGHT, AND LOGGED 262 MILES. AT THE END OF MY TEST DRIVE THE MIRAI REPORTED A MILES PER GALLON EQUIVALENCY (MPGE) OF 60 COMPARED TO THE FACTORY SPEC OF 67 MPGE. THIS WAS MY SECOND TIME BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE MIRAI THE FIRST EXPERIENCE WAS LIMITED TO A 5 MINUTE TEST DRIVE AROUND THE BLOCK AND A DISTANCE LESS THAN TWO MILES. THIS TIME I HAD THE FULL EXPERIENCE AND DROVE IT FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, TO SACRAMENTO, THEN TO THE EAST BAY FOR MORE DRIVING TIME AT NIGHT. I WAS EXPECTING THE MIRAI TO DRIVE SIMILAR TO AN EV, BUT HAD A TOTAL CHANGE IN ATTITUDE BY THE TIME I WAS READY TO RETURN THE KEY TO TOYOTA. THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS ZERO-EMISSION CAR, AND VERY FEW THAT ARENT SO GOOD. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT I APPRECIATED WAS THE HUSH TONE OF THE CABIN AND ITS ABILITY TO INSULATE THE PASSENGERS FROM ROAD NOISE. THE COMBINATION OF ACOUSTIC GLASS, SOUND ABSORBING MATERIALS, AND SOUND-INSULATING MATERIALS PLACED INSIDE THE BODY FRAME WORK TOGETHERREDUCING NOISE AND VIBRATIONS; THE CARPETS ARE FITTED WITHOUT ANY GAPS AND THERE ARE LOTS OF SOFT-TOUCH SURFACES THAT ABSORB SOUND. EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER RESULTING IN A QUIET, REFINED TRIP THAT IS ON PAR WITH A LEXUS ES OR GS. THE STEERING RESPONSE HAS A LIGHT FEEL AND SOMEWHAT NUMB, BUT OVERALL IT IS GOOD FOR BEING ELECTRIC POWER ASSISTED. HANDLING AND RIDE QUALITY IS EVEN BETTER. THERE IS MINIMAL BODY LEAN CARVING THROUGH THE CORNERS AND THE RIDE QUALITY, WHICH FEELS ON THE FIRM SIDE, IS NOT BUMPY OR HARSH FEELING. THE 4,078 POUND CURB WEIGHT PROBABLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE SMOOTH, PLUSH RIDE. THE SEATS ARE INJECTION-MOLDED AND COVERED IN A PSUEDO-LEATHER MATERIAL CALLED SOFTEX, WHILE COMFORTABLE AND CONFORMING, THE MATERIAL ISNT NICE TO TOUCH. I HAVE A SMALL BODY FRAME AND DID NOT NOTICE MYSELF SQUIRMING IN THE SEAT TO FIND A COMFORTABLE SPOT, NOR WAS I SLIDING AROUND WHEN TESTING THE CORNERING CAPABILITIES. THE FRONT AND REAR SEATS ARE HEATED, BUT NEITHER SETUP WITH FANS UNDERNEATH FOR COOLING. THE CABIN DESIGN HAS A SCULPTED DASHBOARD AND AN INFORMATION DISPLAY MOUNTED HIGH AND CENTERED. SCROLLING THROUGH THE MULTITUDE OF DISPLAY SCREENS REPORT INFORMATION ON ENERGY USAGE, MPGE DIARY, HOW GOOD (OR POORLY) YOUR DRIVING STYLE HAS AFFECTED FUEL CONSUMPTION, AND MORE. NAVIGATION, INFOTAINMENT AND CLIMATE CONTROLS ARE ACCESSIBLE ON ANOTHER PANEL BELOW THE CENTRAL DISPLAY SCREENS. THE ELECTROSTATIC TOUCHSCREEN SWITCHES ARE MODERN AND ATTRACTIVE, BUT GETS MESSY WITH FINGERPRINTS AND SMUDGES EASILY. THE MIRAI IS WELL EQUIPPED WITH LED HEADLAMPS, HEATED STEERING WHEEL, INDIVIDUAL AUTOMATIC CLIMATE CONTROL FOR THE FRONT PASSENGERS, AND ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL. BACK SEAT PASSENGERS HAVE HEATED SEATS AND PLENTY OF LEGROOM. BECAUSE THE REAR SEATS SIT ABOVE THE HYDROGEN TANKS, HEADROOM IS LIMITED. MIRAI ALSO HAS A BROAD RANGE OF STANDARD ONBOARD SAFETY TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING VEHICLE PRE-COLLISION, BLIND SPOT MONITOR, LANE DEPARTURE ALERT, DRIVE START CONTROL AND AUTOMATIC HIGH BEAMS. BEGINNING FALL 2015, THE MIRAI IS ONLY GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS WHOSE APPLICATION IS ACCEPTED BY TOYOTA. INITIALLY, EIGHT DEALERSHIPS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO SELL 700 UNITS OF THE HYDROGEN FUEL-CELL CAR, BUT THE PROGRAM WILL EXPAND UP TO 2,000 UNITS NEXT YEAR AND EVENTUALLY BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE NORTHEAST STATES OF CONNECTICUT, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, AND RHODE ISLAND. EARLY ADOPTERS BEWARE THE COST TO OWN A 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI OUTRIGHT IS $58,325, OR LEASE IT FOR $499 A MONTH FOR 36 MONTHS WITH $3,649 DUE AT SIGNING. IF YOU CHOOSE TO PURCHASE A MIRAI, THERE ARE FEDERAL AND STATE INCENTIVES AVAILABLE, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE PRICE BY AS MUCH AS $13,000. THE PURCHASE PRICE INCLUDES THREE YEARS OR $15,000 WORTH OF FREE HYDROGEN FUEL FOR THE CAR; A WEEKS WORTH OF RENTAL-CAR ACCESS FOR THE FIRST THREE YEAR; A HYDROGEN FUEL STATION FINDER APP; 24/7 CUSTOMER SUPPORT; AND AN EIGHT-YEAR, 100,000-MILE HYDROGEN POWERTRAIN WARRANTY. ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES ARE ALLOWED ACCESS TO CALIFORNIAS HIGH OCCUPANCY (HOV) LANES, WHICH IS A GOOD PERK IF YOURE COMMUTING ALONE. LOCATING A REFUELING STATION WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR EARLY ADOPTERS, MUCH LIKE TRYING TO FIND AN EV CHARGING STATION A FEW YEARS AGO. CALIFORNIA HAS PLANS TO OPEN 56 HYDROGEN REFUELING STATIONS IN SELECT AREAS UP THROUGH AUTUMN 2016, OF WHICH EIGHT ARE OFFICIALLY OPEN NOW. CHECK THE CALIFORNIA FUEL CELL PARTNERSHIP (WWW.CAFCP.ORG) WEBSITE FOR MAPS AND CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLANNED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AND THE PROGRAMS PROGRESS. THE WEBSITE IS ALSO A GOOD SOURCE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE COLLABORATION THAT IS HAPPENING WITH INVOLVED GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AUTOMAKERS, AND ENERGY PROVIDERS. USING THE TFL CAR SCALE OF BUY IT! LEASE IT! RENT IT! OR FORGET IT! THE MIRAI GETS EARNS A LEASE IT! FOR ITS ADVANCED ENGINEERING, NEAR-LUXURY RIDE AND COMFORT, AND BETTER THAN AVERAGE RIDE QUALITY. IT LOSES POINTS FOR ITS EXPENSIVE ENTRY PRICE, LACK OF FEEDBACK THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL, AND THE TOUCH QUALITY OF THE SEAT MATERIAL AND PANEL SWITCHES. PLUS, ITS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO BE TIED TO EVOLVING AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGIES SHORT-TERM. WHILE THE MIRAI LEADS US DOWN THE PATH OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND ZERO EMISSIONS, AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS SIMPLY A CAR THAT DOES ITS JOB WELL AND HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF PROVIDING WATER FOR YOUR PLANTS. 2016 TOYOTA MIRAI SPECS: TYPE: POLYMER ELECTROLYTE FUEL CELL MAX.

THE LOCATION IS APPROPRIATE, GIVEN THE TREMENDOUS EUROPEAN -AND ESPECIALLY BRITISH -CONTRIBUTIONS TO COMPUTING. FROM CHARLESBABBAGE'S DIFFERENCE ENGINE ANDADA LOVELACE'S FIRST PROGRAMMING,THOUGH GEORGE BOOLE'S BOOLEAN ALGEBRA ANDKONRAD ZUSE'SMECHANICAL BINARY PROGRAMMABLE COMPUTERS, TO THE COLOSSAL WORK ATBLETCHLEY PARK AND THECREATION OF THE WEB BYTIM BERNERS-LEE, EUROPEAN INNOVATORSLAID MANY OF THE FOUNDATIONS. HOPEFULLY, THIS FIRST DAY WILL REINFORCE THE TREMENDOUS INNOVATIVE POTENTIAL OF EUROPE ANDSET THE TONE FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKAS AN EVENT OF MUTUALBENEFIT. I EMPHASISE THAT SINCE THERE IS A STRONG TENDENCY, ESPECIALLY WHEN TALKING ABOUT IT AND DIGITAL STARTUPS, TO PRESUME THAT SILICON VALLEY HAS ALL THE ANSWERS. THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF CRITICAL ARTICLES ALONG THE LINES OF 'EUROPE NEEDS ITS OWNSILICON VALLEY'. SOME OF THIS CRITICISM IS VALID: EUROPE HAS NOT REALLY PRODUCED ITS EXPECTED SHARE OF DIGITAL 'UNICORNS' (BILLION-DOLLAR STARTUPS); SCALING AND EXITS ARE MORE DIFFICULT; VALUATIONS ARE TYPICALLY LOWER; EUROPEAN ATTITUDES TO RISK ARE MORE CAUTIOUS; EUROPE IS NOT (YET) A DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET LIKE THE US. ON MULTIPLE MEASURES OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, THE US LEADS THE WORLD. MANY EUROPEAN CITIES CAN THEREFORE LEARN MUCH FROM THE VALLEY, ADOPTING SOME CULTURAL ATTITUDES AND ADAPTING SPECIFIC INITIATIVES - JUST AS THE SEED ACCELERATOR MODEL, DEVELOPED BY Y COMBINATOR A DECADE AGO, HAS BEEN WIDELY REPLICATED ACROSS EUROPE (AND CONTINUES TO EVOLVE). YET ON THE OTHER HAND, THE QUALITY OF A STARTUP IS NOT NECESSARILY A REFLECTION OF THE RICHNESS OF THE ECOSYSTEM WHICH PRODUCED IT. AND EUROPE HAS STILL PRODUCED A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT DIGITAL STARTUPS, LIKE SKYPE, KLARNA, PREZI, SOUNDCLOUD, ZALANDO, BLABLACAR, TRIVAGO, SKYSCANNER AND ZOPA, WITH A HUGE INCREASE IN UNICORNS SINCE 2013. THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE INCREASE IN EUROPEAN UNICORNS SINCE 2013 UNFORTUNATELY, MANY GREATEUROPEAN STARTUPS ARE NOT RECOGNISED AS SUCH- IN PART BECAUSE SUCCESSFUL FIRMS OFTENEMIGRATE IN SEARCH OF EASIER FUNDRAISING AND HIGHER VALUATIONS. THIS HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT BACK HOME, REDUCING THE NUMBERS OF ROLE MODELS AND MENTORS.HOWEVER, IT IS OFTENA SENSIBLE MOVE FOR THE FIRM, GIVENTHAT THE US VENTURE CAPITAL INDUSTRY IS MUCH MORE DEVELOPED THAN EUROPE. FOR INSTANCE, DATA FROM STARTUP INTELLIGENCE FIRM FUNDERBEAM SHOWS THAT, SO FAR IN 2015, THE US HAS PRODUCED ROUGHLY TWICE AS MANY STARTUPS AS THE WHOLE OF EUROPE - BUT THOSE STARTUPS HAVE COLLECTIVELY RECEIVED AROUND 10 TIMES AS MUCH FUNDING ($62 BILLION TOTAL INVESTMENT, COMPARED WITH JUST $6.6 BILLION FOR EUROPEAN STARTUPS). THIS GAP IS A REFLECTION NOT OF QUALITY (USAND EUROPEAN TECH STARTUPS HAVE ROUGHLY THE SAME LIKELIHOOD OF A SUCCESSFULIPO), BUT OF THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE US VC INDUSTRY,ITS WILLINGNESS TO PLACE BIGGER BETS ON US FIRMS, AND THE FACT THAT MANY VCS REMAIN QUITE GEOGRAPHICALLY-FOCUSSED. IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG-TERM, THEN,DEVELOPING EUROPES STARTUP ECOSYSTEMS (IDEALLY, IN THEIR OWN WAYS, PLAYING ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS) AND GROWING THE EUROPEAN VC INDUSTRY IS CLEARLY ESSENTIAL. BUT IN THE NEARER-TERM, EUROPEAN STARTUPS NEED TO BECOME MORE VISIBLE TO AMERICAN VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS. THIS IS WHAT I HOPE SEC2SV WILL DELIVER:A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE AND QUALITY OF EUROPEAN STARTUPS AMONG US VCS, AND HENCE GREATER NUMBERS OF VCS WHO ARE PREPARED TO INVEST IN EUROPE. THIS, IN TURN, MIGHT HAVE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF STIMULATING MORE STARTUPS & SCALEUPS IN EUROPE, AND HELPING MORE GROW HERE - RATHER THAN FEELING THE NEED TO EMIGRATE TO THE US.

767	UPDATE. 1.1 MILLION HAS ALREADY BEEN DRAWN FROM COUNCIL RESERVES TO FUND ONE-OFF PLANNED EXPENDITURE THIS YEAR. IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR BLAENAU GWENT COUNCIL ANNOUNCED ITS PLAN TO MAKE 6.1 MILLION OF SAVINGS FOR 2015/16. PROMOTED STORIES ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, WHICH FORECASTS WHETHER THE COUNCIL WILL MEET ITS BUDGET BY THE END OF THE YEAR, FOUR COUNCIL DEPARTMENTS ARE SET TO UNDERSPEND BY THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY IS UNDERSPENDING BECAUSE OF SAVINGS IN STAFF COSTS WHILE HIGHWAYS AND TRANSPORT HAS SPENT LESS BECAUSE OF TWO VACANT JOB POSTS AND LESS MONEY SPENT ON STREET LIGHTING UTILITY COSTS. BUT ONE "COST PRESSURE" IN HIGHWAYS AND TRANSPORT IS THE NEW MECHANICAL LINK IN EBBW VALE WHICH HAS HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED REVENUE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS. SOCIAL SERVICES OVERALL SAW AN UNDERSPEND THANKS TO GRANT FUNDING AND HEALTH CARE INCOME, ALTHOUGH AN INCREAS IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN CHILDRENS HOMES MEANT CHILDRENS SERVICES IS DUE TO OVERSPEND. SHARE ARTICLE AMONG THE DEPARTMENTS SET TO OVERSPEND IS PLANNING , BECAUSE OF 40,840 INCURRED FROM A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO A COUNCIL DECISION ON A WIND FRM, AS WELL AS WASTE MANAGEMENT AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE REPORT IS DUE TO BE REVIEWED BY THE COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON WEDNESDAY MORNING. BLAENA GWENT COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO CONTROL ITS SPENDING TO AVOID AN UNPLANNED DRAW FROM ITS RESERVES, A REPORT BEING SUBMITTED TO COUNCILLORS TOMORROW HAS REVEALED.  WHILE OVERALL SPENDING ACROSS ALL COUNCIL AREAS IS LESS THAN EXPECTED, THE REVENUE BUDGET MONITORING FORECAST REPORT REVEALED FIVE COUNCIL DEPARTMENTS ARE SET TO OVERSPEND BY 640,000. THE REPORT SAID A MAJOR RISK IS THAT EXPENDITURE EXCEEDS THE BUDGET AT THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR, LEADING TO UNPLANNED DRAW FROM THE COUNCILS GENERAL RESERVES. CHIEF ACCOUNTANT AT THE COUNCIL, GINA TAYLOR, WROTE IN THE REPORT: IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL PORTFOLIOS CONTINUE TO CONTROL EXPENDITURE IN ORDER TO EITHER MAINTAIN UNDERSPENDS OR TO MINIMISE FURTHER OVERSPENDS. THIS WILL ASSIST IN MITIGATING ANY POTENTIAL UNPLANNED DRAW FROM RESERVES.
768	LONDON: TROUBLESOME CHELSEA STRIKER DIEGO COSTA WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A PETTY CRIMINAL RATHER THAN A MASTER VILLAIN IN THE 1950S AND 1960S, ACCORDING TO BRAZIL GREAT PELE. COSTA, WHO WAS BORN IN BRAZIL BUT OPTED TO REPRESENT SPAIN AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, HAS BEEN BANNED FOR THREE GAMES FOR TWICE HITTING LAURENT KOSCIELNY DURING CHELSEA'S 2-0 DEFEAT OF ARSENAL LAST WEEKEND. IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE SNARLING CENTRE-FORWARD HAS FALLEN FOUL OF THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES, BUT PELE, FAMOUSLY KICKED OUT OF THE 1966 WORLD CUP BY PORTUGAL'S JOAO MORAIS, SAID COSTA'S CRIMES WERE NOTHING COMPARED TO THE PUNISHMENTS METED OUT TO HIM DURING HIS EXTRAORDINARY CAREER. "LISTEN, THIS TO ME WAS SO COMMON," A SMILING PELE TOLD AFP. "I SUFFERED ALL MY LIFE WITH GOOD MARKING. HE'S A VERY GOOD PLAYER, EVERYBODY KNOWS. "THIS WAS ONE MOMENT. THE STRIKER WHO BIT SOMEONE, LUIS SUAREZ, WAS WORSE THAN THIS." PELE, A LEADING CONTENDER FOR THE TITLE OF GREATEST FOOTBALLER OF ALL-TIME, WAS SPEAKING AT THE LAUNCH OF AN EXHIBITION TO MARK HIS 75TH BIRTHDAY, WHICH FALLS ON OCTOBER 23. CALLED 'ART, LIFE, FOOTBALL', THE EXHIBITION AT LONDON'S HALCYON GALLERY FEATURES ARTWORKS DEPICTING MEMORABLE MOMENTS FROM PELE'S CAREER, INCLUDING A 1977 PORTRAIT BY POP ART PIONEER ANDY WARHOL. UNLIKE TODAY'S STARS, THERE IS NOT A SURFEIT OF FOOTAGE OF PELE IN ACTION, BUT SOME OF HIS GOALS WERE SO FAMOUS THEY ACQUIRED THEIR OWN EPITHETS. THERE WAS 'O MILESIMO', A PENALTY FOR SANTOS -- HIS ONLY BRAZILIAN CLUB -- AGAINST VASCO DA GAMA THAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE HIS 1,000TH GOAL. A PITCH-LONG DRIBBLE AND SHOT AGAINST FLUMINENSE IN 1961 WAS DEEMED WORTHY OF A PLAQUE AT RIO DE JANEIRO'S ICONIC MARACANA, THE GROUND WHERE IT WAS SCORED, EARNING IT THE NICKNAME 'GOL DE PLACA'. MEANWHILE, THE GOAL PELE CONSIDERED HIS BEST, IN WHICH HE REPUTEDLY FLICKED THE BALL OVER THREE DEFENDERS AND THE GOALKEEPER BEFORE HEADING IN DURING A MATCH AGAINST THE BRAZILIAN JUVENTUS IN 1959, WAS RECREATED USING CGI IN 2014. "PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEM UNTIL NOW BECAUSE THEY WERE SO GOOD," SAYS PELE -- FULL NAME EDSON ARANTES DO NASCIMENTO -- OF THE FLUMINENSE AND JUVENTUS GOALS, NEITHER OF WHICH WAS CAUGHT ON FILM. "OF COURSE I HAD OTHER GOALS THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO ME, IN A WORLD CUP TOO. BUT THESE TWO GOALS WERE THE ONES PEOPLE MENTIONED MORE. "THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL GOALS, BUT THERE WERE OTHER IMPORTANT GOALS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 1,000TH GOAL. "IT WAS A PENALTY KICK. EVERYBODY SAID, 'OH, IT'S EASY TO SCORE A GOAL WITH A PENALTY KICK.' "BUT TO ME, IN THE MARACANA, I WAS SHAKING, I WAS SO NERVOUS. I SAID TO MYSELF, 'MY GOD, I CANNOT MISS THIS MOMENT.' THIS 1,000TH GOAL WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME TOO." PELE, WHO UNDERWENT SPINAL SURGERY IN JULY, CONSIDERS LIONEL MESSI TO BE THE WORLD'S BEST CURRENT PLAYER AND CITES ENGLAND'S 1966 WORLD CUP-WINNING MIDFIELDER BOBBY CHARLTON AS HIS "MOST DIFFICULT OPPONENT". CHARLTON WAS RECENTLY SURPASSED BY WAYNE ROONEY AS ENGLAND'S RECORD GOAL-SCORER AND THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT NEYMAR WILL ONE DAY CLAIM PELE'S RECORD FOR BRAZIL. THE BARCELONA FORWARD, 23, HAS ALREADY SCORED 46 INTERNATIONAL GOALS AND HAS PELE'S MARK OF 77 IN HIS SIGHTS. BUT WITH NEYMAR HAVING STARTED OUT, LIKE PELE, AT SANTOS, THE THREE-TIME WORLD CUP-WINNER IS RELAXED ABOUT THE PROSPECT. "COINCIDENTALLY, NEYMAR IS FROM SANTOS. HE STARTED THERE," SAID PELE, WHO ALSO SPENT TWO YEARS AT NEW YORK COSMOS. "MY SON, EDINHO (SENTENCED LAST YEAR TO A 33-YEAR JAIL TERM FOR MONEY LAUNDERING), WHO WAS A GOALKEEPER, WAS HIS COACH IN THE UNDER-20S. IF NEYMAR BREAKS THIS RECORD, FANTASTIC. ONE MORE FOR SANTOS!" AS MUCH AS HE ENJOYS WATCHING NEYMAR AND MESSI STRUT THEIR STUFF, HOWEVER, PELE RESORTS TO AN OLD REFRAIN WHEN ASKED IF ANYONE IN THE MODERN GAME REMINDS HIM OF HIMSELF. "I USED TO SAY: 'LISTEN, EVERYBODY WANTS TO FIND A NEW PELE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE,'" HE SAYS. "MY MOTHER AND MY FATHER CLOSED THE MACHINE. NO MORE!" FOLLOW TOI SPORTS ON TWITTER @TOISPORTSNEWS

770	SUMMARY OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO, KROGER HAS PROVIDED MUCH HIGHER RETURNS THAN EITHER WAL-MART OR TARGET. THIS OUTPERFORMANCE WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS COMING TOGETHER. INTERESTINGLY, THE SAME COMPONENTS THAT LED TO PAST OUTPERFORMANCE COULD PROVIDE A DRAG ON RETURNS MOVING FORWARD. IN A PREVIOUS ARTICLE , I DETAILED HOW KROGER (NYSE: KR ) PROVIDED VERY SOLID INVESTMENT RETURNS OVER THE PAST DECADE. IT CAME DOWN TO A FEW THINGS: REASONABLE GROWTH COUPLED WITH A SOLID REDUCTION IN SHARE COUNT AND AN EXPANSION IN THE EARNINGS MULTIPLE. THAT IS, KROGER, AS A COMPANY, SAW REASONABLE GROWTH, BUT INVESTORS RECEIVED AN OUTSIZED BENEFIT. REVIEWING THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION CAN BE HELPFUL FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST, IT PROVIDES YOU WITH A HISTORICAL VIEW OF THE INVESTMENT. YOU CAN SEE THE MAJOR COMPONENTS INTERACT TO GIVE YOU A BETTER FEEL FOR WHY SOMETHING OCCURRED. PERHAPS JUST AS IMPORTANT IS THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN GET A GAUGE AS TO REPEATABILITY. NATURALLY, HISTORY DOES NOT REPEAT ITSELF, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T LEARN SOMETHING. IF A SECURITY WAS "SUCCESSFUL" IN THE PAST DUE TO CERTAIN COMPONENTS, IT CAN BE TELLING TO REVIEW THOSE VALUE-DRIVING FACTORS. THESE TWO THINGS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY LOOKING AT A SINGLE SECURITY. IT CAN ALSO BE USEFUL TO COMPARE A SINGLE COMPANY TO SOME SIMILAR COMPETITORS: FOR INSTANCE WAL-MART (NYSE: WMT ) AND TARGET (NYSE: TGT ). OF COURSE, THERE ARE OTHER (AND PERHAPS MORE DIRECT) COMPETITORS OUT THERE FOR KROGER, BUT AS FAR AS LARGE-CAP DIVIDEND GROWTH COMPANIES GO, WAL-MART AND TARGET OFFER A SOLID BASELINE. HERE'S A SIDE-BY-SIDE (BY-SIDE) COMPARISON OF KROGER, WAL-MART AND TARGET DATING BACK TO FISCAL-YEAR 2005. NOTE THAT ALL NUMBERS ARE BASED ON FISCAL RATHER THAN CALENDAR YEARS: KR WMT TGT REVENUE GROWTH 6.7% 4.9% 3.6% START PROFIT MARGIN 1.6% 3.5% 4.6% END PROFIT MARGIN 1.6% 3.4% 3.8% EARNINGS GROWTH 7.0% 4.5% 1.4% YEARLY SHARE COUNT -4.3% -2.8% -3.4% EPS GROWTH 11.5% 7.6% 5.2% START P/E 14 18 20 END P/E 20 17 17 SHARE PRICE GROWTH 15.8% 7.0% 3.3% % OF DIVS COLLECTED 20% 25% 16% START PAYOUT % 17% 23% 14% END PAYOUT % 20% 38% 44% DIVIDEND GROWTH 13.2% 13.8% 19.6% TOTAL RETURNS 16.5% 8.6% 4.7% THIS TABLE PROVIDES ALL THE MAJOR CUES AS TO WHY KROGER PROVIDED INVESTORS WITH MUCH HIGHER RETURNS AS COMPARED TO SHAREHOLDERS IN WAL-MART OR TARGET. LET'S START AT THE TOP AND WORK OUR WAY DOWN. KROGER STARTED THE PERIOD WITH REVENUES OF ABOUT $60 BILLION AND GREW THIS NUMBER TO OVER $108 BILLION - THIS EQUATES TO REVENUE GROWTH OF ABOUT 6.7% PER YEAR. WAL-MART IS MUCH LARGER - HAVING STARTED WITH $315 BILLION IN REVENUES - BUT DIDN'T GROW AS FAST. AT THE END OF THE PERIOD, THE COMPANY GENERATED $485 BILLION IN REVENUES, GOOD FOR A GROWTH RATE OF ABOUT 4.9% PER YEAR. TARGET LAGS IN BOTH CATEGORIES. THE COMPANY STARTED THE PERIOD WITH ABOUT $53 BILLION IN REVENUES AND ENDED FISCAL YEAR 2014 WITH $73 BILLION IN SALES. THIS EQUATES TO A GROW RATE OF 3.6%, AND DEMONSTRATES SOME OF THE LATER PERIOD STRUGGLES WITH THE FAILED EXPANSION IN CANADA . SO KROGER BEGINS WITH A SOLID LEG-UP. THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO INCREASE TOTAL SALES AT A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN EITHER WAL-MART OR TARGET. IF THE PROFIT MARGIN REMAINS THE SAME DURING THE OBSERVATION PERIOD, YOU'D SEE TOTAL EARNINGS GROWTH THAT MIRRORS TOTAL REVENUE GROWTH. KROGER SAW A SLIGHT INCREASE IN ITS MARGIN WHILE BOTH WAL-MART AND TARGET SAW A DECREASE IN TOTAL PROFITABILITY. AS SUCH, KROGER'S TOTAL EARNINGS GREW BY A SLIGHTLY FASTER RATE THAN REVENUES (ABOUT 7% PER YEAR) WHEREAS THE OTHER TWO COMPANIES SAW TOTAL EARNINGS GROWTH THAT LAGGED OVERALL SALES GROWTH. ONCE MORE KROGER HAS A SOLID LEAD. NOTE THAT IN DEVELOPING THE GROWTH PROFILE OF AN INVESTMENT, THE IMPORTANT PART IS WHERE YOU START AND NOT WHERE YOU ARE. BOTH WAL-MART AND TARGET MAKE QUITE A BIT MORE THAN KROGER ON EACH DOLLAR WORTH OF SALES. KROGER SELLS MORE STUFF THAN TARGET, BUT TARGET MAKES A LOT MORE MONEY - ROUGHLY $1 BILLION MORE IN FISCAL-YEAR 2014. STILL, THE LOWER BASE AND SUBSEQUENT MAINTAINING OF MARGINS ALLOWED KROGER TO PROVIDE BETTER GROWTH. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO RAG ON "FINANCIAL ENGINEERING" VIA SHARE BUYBACKS, BUT REALLY IT'S JUST A WAY TO ALLOCATE CAPITAL. CONSISTENT SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BUY OUT PARTNERS ON YOUR BEHALF, SO YOUR UNDERLYING EARNINGS CLAIM GROWS AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE COMPANY. THESE THREE COMPANIES ARE CERTAINLY NO EXCEPTION: DECREASING COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING BY 4.3%, 2.8% AND 3.4% ANNUALLY. THAT'S A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE OVER A DECADE. IT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT ELIMINATES ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR SHAREHOLDERS DURING THE TIME PERIOD. AS SUCH OF THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, SHAREHOLDERS SAW THEIR UNDERLYING EARNINGS CLAIM GROW AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE COMPANY BY ITSELF. KROGER ONCE MORE LEAD THE TRIO, RESULTING IN DOUBLE-DIGIT EARNINGS-PER-SHARE GROWTH. AT THIS POINT, KROGER HAS A REASONABLY SOLID ADVANTAGE. IT WOULD TAKE A LARGE COMPARATIVE REDUCTION IN WHAT SHAREHOLDERS WERE WILLING TO PAY FOR THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS IN ORDER FOR KROGER NOT TO TURN OUT BETTER INVESTMENT RESULTS. IN FACT, THE OPPOSITE HAPPENED. IF THE BEGINNING AND END EARNINGS MULTIPLE REMAIN THE SAME, SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION WILL BE EQUAL TO EARNINGS-PER-SHARE GROWTH. IN THIS CASE, ALL THREE COMPANIES SAW THE P/E RATIO BOUNCE ABOUT. KR'S INVESTORS SAW THE EARNINGS MULTIPLE MOVE FROM ABOUT 14 ALL THE WAY UP TO 20 - RESULTING IN SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION (AT NEARLY 16% PER YEAR) THAT GREATLY OUTPACED EPS GROWTH. ON THE OTHER HAND, BOTH WMT AND TGT EXPERIENCED P/E COMPRESSION DURING THIS PERIOD. AS SUCH, THE SHARE PRICE GROWTH FOR THESE TWO COMPANIES TRAILED THE EPS GROWTH. FINALLY, WE CAN LOOK AT THE DIVIDENDS. IN THIS RESPECT, THE COMPANIES HAVEN'T BEEN ALL THAT DIFFERENT. EACH HAS GROWN ITS PAYOUT BY A VERY SOLID RATE AND RETURNED AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TOTAL CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS. WAL-MART SHOWS MORE TOTAL FUNDS RETURNED, AND TARGET HAD A HIGHER GROWTH RATE, BUT IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED VIA A LARGER INCREASE IN THE PAYOUT RATIO. MOVING TO THE BOTTOM LINE, KROGER WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE 16.5% YEARLY RETURNS AS COMPARED TO 8.6% FOR WAL-MART AND UNDER 5% FOR TARGET. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE BUSINESSES AREN'T THAT DISSIMILAR. ALL THREE COMPANIES SELL SOME OF THE SAME GOODS, INCREASE SALES OVER THE YEARS, MAKE A SMALL PROFIT WITH LARGE QUANTITIES, REDUCE SHARE COUNT AND PAY AN INCREASING DIVIDEND. YET, THE INTERACTION OF THE COMPONENTS MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE INVESTOR. KROGER WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE MUCH HIGHER RETURNS FOR A FEW REASONS. THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO GROW A BIT FASTER, MAINTAINED ITS MARGINS, REDUCED ITS SHARE COUNT BY A GREATER RATE, AND INVESTORS WERE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR SHARES AS TIME WENT ON. MOVING FORWARD, THIS CAN BE HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT THE PROCESS. FIRST IT ANSWERS THE QUESTION PRESENTED BY THIS ARTICLE'S TITLE. JUST AS IMPORTANT, IT GIVES YOU SOME INSIGHT INTO THE POTENTIAL REPEATABILITY MOVING FORWARD. FOR INSTANCE, DUE TO KR'S LOWER PAYOUT RATIO, YOU MIGHT SUSPECT THAT THE COMPANY CAN CONTINUE TO INCREASE ITS DIVIDEND AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE OTHER TWO. AS AN EXAMPLE, TGT HAS ALREADY BEGUN ON ITS " GLIDE PATH " AS CONSTRAINED BY THE INCREASED PAYOUT RATIO. MOREOVER, THIS TYPE OF REVIEW MIGHT PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO WHAT TYPE OF GROWTH YOU COULD EXPECT IN THE FUTURE. KROGER SAW MUCH SUPERIOR SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION DUE TO AN EXPANSION IN ITS EARNINGS MULTIPLE. TODAY, THE SHARE PRICE IS EVEN HIGHER - INDICATING THAT PERHAPS A CAUTIOUS ASSUMPTION WOULD SURMISE THAT A LOWER RATHER THAN HIGHER VALUATION MIGHT BE POSSIBLE. IF SO, THE ACCELERATED SHARE PRICE GROWTH OF THE PAST WOULD SUDDENLY TURN INTO A LAG WHEREBY THE SHARE PRICE GROWS AT A SLOWER RATE THAN FUTURE EARNINGS-PER-SHARE GROWTH. ALTERNATIVELY, WAL-MART HAS SEEN ITS PRICE MOVE MATERIALLY LOWER - PERHAPS INDICATING THAT FUTURE SHARE PRICE GROWTH COULD OUTPACE EPS GROWTH . IN SHORT, KROGER WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPERIOR INVESTMENT RETURNS DUE TO FASTER GROWTH, RETIRING MORE SHARES AND THE FACT THAT INVESTORS WERE WILLING TO PAY A HIGHER VALUATION. THIS ILLUMINATES THE INVESTMENT HISTORY OF THESE THREE SECURITIES, BUT IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THIS MUST ALWAYS HOLD. INDEED, SOME OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT GOT KROGER TO THIS POINT - SUCH AS A HIGHER VALUATION - COULD BE MORE OF A DRAG ON RETURNS IN THE FUTURE. THE IDEA IS TO GET A HISTORICAL VIEW AS TO WHY CERTAIN EVENTS MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED AND THEN TO THINK ABOUT THE RELATIVE REPEATABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MOVING FORWARD.
771	ONTARIO DOCTORS WARN THAT PATIENTS WILL HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CUTTING THEIR FEES. THE GOVERNMENT IS CHOPPING FEES BY 1.3 PER CENT STARTING NEXT WEEK TO KEEP THE PROFESSION WITHIN AN ALLOTTED $11.6-BILLION BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. DR. MICHAEL TOTH, PRESIDENT OF THE ONTARIO MEDICAL ASSOCIATION , SAYS THE PROFESSION IS FRUSTRATED AND SOME MEMBERS ARE TALKING ABOUT LEAVING THE PROVINCE OR RETIRING EARLY. "IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PATIENTRS ULTIMATELY," HE WARNED, NOTING THAT SOME PHYSICIANS WILL BE FORCED TO LAY OFF STAFF AND CUT OFFICE BUDGETS.  PERHAPS PREDICTABLY, THE DEBATE OFTEN FELL ALONG PARTISAN LINES. PHYSICIANS ARE VENTING THEIR ANGER ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ON TWITTER , HARDLINERS ARE THREATENING JOB ACTION SUCH AS A WORK-TO-RULE CAMPAIGN, HOUR CUTBACKS AND CANCELLATION OF FLU-SHOT CLINICS. TOTH SAID THE OMA, WHICH REPRESENTS 28,000 MEMBERS, WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH GOVERNMENT AND IS CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION. HEALTH MINISTER ERIC HOSKINS SAID HE WANTS TO REASSURE ONTARIANS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERVICE CUTS. "MY CONCERN IS THAT A PERCEPTION IS BEING PROPAGATED THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE CHALLENGING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE FACTS SIMPLY DON'T BEAR THIS OUT," HE SAID. ONTARIO DOCTORS ARE AMONG THE BEST PAID IN CANADA WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF ABOUT $350,000, AN AMOUNT THAT HAS GROWN BY 60S PER CENT OVER THAT LAST DECADE, HOSKINS SAID. FROM THAT, PHYSICIANS PAY OVERHEAD COSTS, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE WAGECS AND OFFICE RENT, AN AMOUNT WIDELY QUOTED AS ABOUT 30 PER CENT.  I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD." THE RIFT DATES BACK TO A PAYMENT SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT UNILATERALLY IMPOSED LAST JANUARY AFTER A YEAR OFW NEGOTIATIONSU WITH THE OMA ENDED IN AN IMPASSE. IT INCLUDED A 2.65 PER CENT FEE CUT AND A CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT WOULD TAKE EFFECT IF DOCTORS' OHIP BILLINGS WERE TAKING DOCTORS OVER THEIR $11.6-ALLOTMENT. THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENT MODEL ALLOWS DOCTORS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPENSATION. IF THEY SEE MORE PATIENTS AND PERFORM MORE PROCEDURES, THEY CAN BILL THE PUBLIC INSURANBCE PLAN FOR MORE MONEY. THE PAYMENT SCHEME ALSO INCLUDEDS INCREASES OF 1.25 PER CENT IN THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES BUDGET FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE ANNUAL INCREASES ARE INTENDED TO MEET A RISE IN DEMAND FROM A GROWING AND AGING POPULATION AND THE ADDAITION OF 700 NEW DOCTORS. BUT THE OMA CONTENDS INCREASES OF 2.7 PER CENT ARE NEEDED IN EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND GROWTH. THE OMA IS LOBBYING MPPS, HOLDING TOWN HALL MEETINGS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE PROVINCE AND STAGING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH MEMBERS NEXT WEEK. TOTH ARGUED THERE IS A "POWER IMBALANCE" WITH GOVERNMENT AND CALLED FOR A NEUTRAL THIRD-PARTY TO WEIGH IN WITH A BINDING DECISION: "WE ARE LOOKING TO RESOLVE THIS ... WE THINK THE WAY TO DO THIS IS MEDIATION-ARBITRATION."
772	UPDATE. THE RISK OF ENDURING ANOTHER PREMATURE BIRTH IS VERY REAL FOR MARTINE*, WHO IS SIX MONTHS PREGNANT WITCH HER SECOND CHILD. HER FIRST WAS BORN SEVEN WEEKS TOO EARLY AFTER A BEATING FROM HER EX-PARTNER FORCED HER INTO A HOSPITAL BED AND CONSEQUENTLY LABOUR. SIX YEARS LATER MARTINE, 29, HAS A NEW RELATIONSHIP AND A NEW BABY ON THE WAY BUT THE ABUSE HAS NOT STOPPED FROM HER EX-PARTNER, WHO CONTINUES TO HARASS HER DAILY. MARTINE IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY WOMEN IN AUSTRALIA WHOSE PREGNANCY HAS TRIGGERED YEARS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST THEM AND THEIR CHILD. DESPITE LEAVING THE MAN WHO BEAT HER INTO EARLY LABOUR, MARTINE FEARS HIS CONSTANT HARASSMENT COULD FORCE ANOTHER PREMATURE BIRTH. "HE HAS THREATENED MY LIFE, KILLED ANIMALS IN MY YARD, THREATENS ANY NEW RELATIONSHIP I START TO THE POINT WHERE PARTNERS HAVE LEFT ME," SHE SAYS. MARTINE HAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORDER IN PLACE, BUT SAYS HER EX-PARTNER HAS CHANGED HIS METHODS OF HARASSMENT TO AVOID GETTING CAUGHT. "MY TYRES HAVE BEEN LET DOWN, HIS CAR CONSTANTLY DRIVES PAST MY HOME, AND I KEEP GETTING PRIVATE NUMBERS CALLING MY PHONE. JUST THIS MORNING I HAD A CALL AND I KNOW IT'S HIM," SHE SAYS. "I HAVE HAD TO CHANGE MY PHONE NUMBER SIX TIMES." HAVING ALREADY BEEN THROUGH A PRE-TERM BIRTH AND LIVING WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS, MARTINE'S PREGNANCY IS CLASSIFIED AS BEING HIGH-RISK. HOWEVER, AT SIX MONTHS PREGNANT SHE HAS TO DEFEND HERSELF IN COURT FROM HER EX-PARTNER, WHO HAS MADE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT HER FITNESS TO PARENT THEIR CHILD. "I'M SCARED THE STRESS OF ALL THE COURT CASES COULD TRIGGER ANOTHER PRE-TERM LABOUR," SHE SAID. "HE SAID 'I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL YOU DIE SO I CAN PISS ON YOUR GRAVE'. I KNOW HE WANTS ME OUT OF THE PICTURE ANY WAY POSSIBLE." "HE HAS MADE MY LIFE HELL, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY." A STRING OF WOMEN'S DEATHS CAUSED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN EARLY SEPTEMBER HAS PROMPTED MORE WOMEN TO SPEAK OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES. SARAH*, 26, FOUGHT BACK TEARS AS SHE DESCRIBED HEARING ABOUT THE RECENT SPATE OF ATTACKS AGAINST WOMEN. "IT COULD HAVE BEEN ME," SHE SAYS, REFERRING TO KARINA LOCK WHO WAS SHOT DEAD AT A MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT ON THE GOLD COAST. LOCK'S WAS ONE OF THREE LIVES LOST TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN A HORROR WEEK FOR QUEENSLAND. SARAH IS PERMANENTLY DISABLED FROM HER ABUSIVE EX-PARTNER AND, LIKE MANY WOMEN, THE VIOLENCE WAS EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY. "IT JUST DIDN'T STOP. HE PUSHED SO HARD ONE TIME THAT WHEN I HIT THE FLOOR I TORE DISCS IN MY SPINE. I HAD TO HAVE DISC REPLACEMENT AND A SPINAL FUSION. I HAD TO LEARN TO WALK AGAIN," SHE SAYS, HER VOICE BREAKING AS SHE DESCRIBES HER DAILY STRUGGLE. "I WAKE EVERY DAY IN PAIN. I WILL NEVER RUN COMFORTABLY. AND WHEN MY KIDS WANT ME TO PLAY, I CAN'T. I'M IN TOO MUCH PAIN." SARAH SAYS SHE IS HARASSED DAILY AND ADMITS SHE FEARS FOR HER LIFE; SHE SAYS THE POLICE HAVE IGNORED HER CONCERNS. "HE [EX-PARTNER] HAS TOLD ME HE WFANTS TO KILL HIS EX-WIFE. HE HAS TOLD ME THE WAYS HE WANTS TO DO IT. BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE POLICE THEY SAID IT'S NORMAL FOR PEOPLE TO SAY THEY WANT TO KILL THEIR EX-PARTNERS, AND IT IS A COMMON FIGURE OF SPEECH." NEARLY A QUARTER OF AUSTRALIAN WOMEN SAY THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME FORM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHILST THEY WERE PREGNANT AND HALF OF THEM EXPERIENCED ABUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING THAT PERIOD. JULIE-ANN, 28, IS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING PREGNANCY. "THE ABUSE BEGAN NINE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS 12 WEEKS PREGNANT," JULIE-ANN SAYS, SPEAKING OUT ABOUT HER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. "THINGS WERE FINE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP UNTIL THE 12 WEEK MARK AND THEN, I DON'T KNOW, IT JUST WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE." STATISTICS SHOW LEAVING AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AND PREGNANCY ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS TIMES FOR A WOMAN EXPERIENCING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. JULIE-ANN EXPERIENCED ABUSE FOR NINE AND A HALF YEARS FOLLOWING THE FIRST PREGNANCY THROUGH FEAR OF LEAVING. EVENTUALLY SHE ESCAPED AND MOVED INTERSTATE. "IT FELT SAFER TO STAY," SHE SAYS ABOUT HER NINE YEARS OF ABUSE. "BECAUSE HE WOULD LOSE CONTROL. IF I WAS AWAY I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS, WHAT HE WAS THINKING, OR WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO." FAMILY VIOLENCE ACADEMIC DEBORAH WALSH HAS SPECIFICALLY STUDIED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREGNANCY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SAYS PREGNANCY OFTEN OFFERS HOPE THAT AN ABUSIVE PARTNER WILL CHANGE. "A BABY OFFERS HOPE FOR THE FUTURE AND A HOPE FOR CHANGE," MS WALSH SAID. MS WALSH SAID DUE TO THIS HOPE WOMEN HAVE WHILE PREGNANT MANY PROCESSES INVOLVED IN SCREENING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WOULD NOT BE TOTALLY EFFECTIVE. "WE NEED TO SUPPORT MEN IN OUR COMMUNITY TO MANAGE THEIR FEELINGS APPROPRIATELY, SAFELY, AND NON-VIOLENTLY, IN A WAY THAT IT IS NOT SEEN AS AN ATTACK ON MASCULINITY, BUT INSTEAD A PART OF MASCULINITY," MS WALSH SAID. "UNLESS WE SUPPORT OUR MEN (TO) DEAL WITH THEIR EMOTIONS, FEELINGS AND ASSOCIATED BEHAVIOURS, THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE." DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION CENTRE DIRECTOR AMY COMPTON-KEEN SAID PREGNANCY AND POST-BIRTH WERE BOTH VULNERABLE TIMES FOR WOMEN AND IT WAS COMMON FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO OCCUR AT THESE TIMES.  10. "MANY PREGNANT WOMEN DO NOT REPORT, DISCLOSE, OR SEEK HELP DUE TO FEELING VULNERABLE AND UNCERTAIN OF THE FUTURE," MS COMPTON-KEEN SAID. "THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE MAY INCLUDE PERIODS WHERE THEIR PARTNER IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE, THEIR CHILD, AND BECOMING A PARENT, AND THEY MAY MAKE PROMISES.  YOULL GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS IF IT ISNT A FIRST DRAFT. "THESE PROMISES ARE POWERFUL AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A WOMAN REMAINING IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP." PEOPLE WHO MAY BE DISTRESSED CAN PHONE LIFELINE ON 131 114.

773	I HAD NOT HEARD OF IMRE KERTSZ UNTIL TODAY, BUT I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN JEWISH HISTORY SINCE THE 1970'S, HOLOCAUST HISTORY SINCE THE 80'S, AND HUNGARIAN HISTORY SINCE THE LATE 90'S. ALSO, I AM VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN EUROPE NOW. HIS VOICE IS UNEXPECTED ON THE ANTI-MIGRATION SIDE. PERHAPS IT IS DRIVEN ENTIRE BY HIS ETHNIC JEWISHNESS, BUT IT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE DRAWN FROM A BROAD LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL MIND, AND A LONG HISTORY OF OBSERVING CENTRAL EUROPEAN BEHAVIOR. THERE WAS A LINKED WEEKLY STANDARD ARTICLE TODAY WHICH INTRODUCED ME TO KERTSZ. I DON'T KNOW WHAT EUROPE SHOULD DO ABOUT AN INVASION WHICH IS ABOUT 25% PATHETIC REFUGEES AND 75% OPPORTUNISTS WITH LARGELY ECONOMIC MOTIVES - OR WORSE. I DON'T BLAME THE YOUNG MEN FROM AFRICA AND ASIA FOR THEIR DESIRE TO MOVE TO A PLACE WHERE THEY MIGHT MAKE A DECENT LIVING, AS OPPOSED TO THE OPPRESSIVE COUNTRIES THEY COME FROM. BUT NEITHER DO I FEEL SORRY FOR THAT GROUP. HOW DO THEY RESCUE THE ONE AND TURN BACK THE OTHER? ESPECIALLY AS THE 25% IS A DEFEATED, FRIGHTENED, KICKED-DOG GROUP WHILE THE OTHER IS A DEFIANT, VIOLENT SECTOR PREPARED TO PUNISH ANYONE IN THEIR PATH? AND ARE ALREADY COMPLAINING THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING TREATED RIGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR MUSLIM SENSIBILITIES? IF YOU WANT A NICE MULTICULTI GROUP WITH DECENT FAMILIES MOVING IN TO HELP TEACH YOUR CHILDREN THAT "SEE? THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE ALL OVER. LET'S HAVE THEM FOR BARBECUE - OH! OR SOMETHING - NEXT SATURDAY," THEN THESE ARE NOT THE DROIDS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. A SERBIAN FRIEND, A REFUGEE WHO WORKS AT MY HOSPITAL SAID LAST WEEK. "I HATE, HATE MILOEVI. HE WOULD KILL HIS MOTHER. BUT THIS IS WHAT HE SAID." A STORY FROM 1993. OUR FAMILY SPONSORED A HAITIAN CHILD FROM ABOUT 1986-96. IN 1991, HAITIANS STARTED COMING ACROSS TO FLORIDA IN MAKESHIFT BOATS IN INCREASING NUMBERS. BUSH 41 HAD THEM STEERED TO GUANTANAMO OR BACK TO HAITI, WHILE WE DECIDED WHAT TO DO WITH A GROUP WHICH WAS PART POLITICAL, PART ECONOMIC REFUGEE. BILL CLINTON MADE IT A CAMPAIGN ISSUE, THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE SO CRUEL AS TO NOT RESCUE SUCH PEOPLE, PROMISING THE US WOULD HELP SUCH SUFFERERS UNDER A CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. IN EARLY 1993 THE NUMBERS OF HAITIANS IN RIDICULOUSLY RICKETY BOATS SUDDENLY INCREASED IN THE ATLANTIC. WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY RESCUE THEM IN A WELCOMING CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. WE EVENTUALLY, QUIETLY, WITHOUT A LOT OF REPORTING, SENT THEM BACK. EXCEPT FOR THOSE WHO HAD ALREADY DROWNED TRYING TO GET HERE, CONFIDENT THAT THE CALCULATED RISK WAS NOW WORTH IT. THEIR NUMBER INCLUDED THE FATHER OF OUR SPONSORED CHILD. I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR TRYING. WHY WOULDN'T HE BELIEVE WHAT AN AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SAID? FALSE KINDNESS KILLS, AND IT KILLS THE POOREST AND MOST VULNERABLE. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT EUROPE SHOULD DO, BUT I DON'T SEE HOW IT CAN ABSORB THE MILLIONS WHO WILL WANT TO COME. THEY WANT TO COME TO GERMANY, AND SWEDEN, AND FRANCE. THEY ARE TRYING TO BYPASS A DOZEN WARLESS BUT POORER NATIONS. YET WESTERN EUROPE, FOR ALL ITS RHETORIC, IS ULTIMATELY ABLE TO SLOW THE NUMBERS INTO THEIR COUNTRIES TO A MANAGEABLE LEVEL. AS IN THE YEARS 640-1683, IT WILL BE ITALY, GREECE, BULGARIA, SERBIA, CROATIA, MACEDONIA, ROMANIA, HUNGARY WHO PAY THE PRICE.
774	VENUS WILLIAMS DOESNT ENJOY TRIPS DOWN MEMORY LANE, AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE VIEW MAY BE. EVEN WHEN THE PAST IS STARING AT HER AS SPECTATOR AND FORMER RIVAL M VENUS WILLIAMS DOESNT ENJOY TRIPS DOWN MEMORY LANE, AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE VIEW MAY BE. EVEN WHEN THE PAST IS STARING AT HER AS SPECTATOR AND FORMER RIVAL MARTINA HINGIS WAS DURING WILLIAMS THIRD ROUND U.S. OPEN MATCH FRIDAY THE 35-YEAR-OLD PREFERS TO LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD; LESS INTERESTED IN REVISITING HER 1997 FINALS RUN AS A DEBUTING, UNSEEDED TEENAGER WITH RED, WHITE AND BLUE BRAIDS AS DISCUSSING THE OPPONENT IN FRONT OF HER. THAT OPPONENT WAS ANOTHER SWISS STAR, 12TH-SEEDED BELINDA BENCIC, WHO WAS BORN THE SAME YEAR WILLIAMS FIRST APPEARED IN FLUSHING, AND WHO THREE WEEKS AGO BECAME JUST THE SECOND PERSON TO BEAT WILLIAMS SISTER, SERENA, THIS YEAR. ENTERING THE MATCH HAVING LOST A SET IN EACH OF THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS, THE 23RD-SEEDED WILLIAMS PUT ON AN IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE OVER THE TEENAGE THREAT, USING A SERVE STRAIGHT OUT OF HER PRIME TO DEFEAT BENCIC, 6-3, 6-4 AT ARTHUR ASHE STADIUM. AFTER ADVANCING TO THE TOURNAMENTS FOURTH ROUND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE YEARS, WILLIAMS MENTIONED SHE RECEIVED SOME ADVICE FOR THE MATCH FROM A CERTAIN TOP-RANKED PLAYER IN THE WORLD, WHO RECENTLY PLAYED BENCIC. YES, BUT THATS BETWEEN US, WILLIAMS SAID WITH A SMILE. I THINK IT WORKED. WILLIAMS, WHO OVERCAME A 4-1 DEFICIT IN THE SECOND SET TO THE SECOND-HIGHEST SEED LEFT IN THE TOP HALF OF THE DRAW, NEXT WILL PLAY 19-YEAR-OLD QUALIFIER ANETT KONTAVEIT, WHO IS RANKED NO. 152 IN THE WORLD AND HAD NEVER WON A GRAND SLAM MATCH BEFORE THIS WEEK. WITH ONE MORE WIN, WILLIAMS WILL BE IN POSITION FOR A POTENTIAL SHOWDOWN WITH HER TOP-SEEDED SISTER IN THE QUARTERFINALS. DESPITE BEING FAR TOO EXPERIENCED TO LOOK TOO FAR AHEAD, WILLIAMS ADMITTED THE LOOMING BATTLE IN WHICH SERENAS PURSUIT OF A CALENDAR GRAND SLAM WOULD BE AT STAKE HAS CROSSED HER MIND. HOW COULD IT NOT? AS MUCH AS SHES TRIED TO MAKE THEIR PREVIOUS 26, OFTEN AWKWARD PROFESSIONAL MEETINGS (15-11, SERENA) FEEL LIKE ANY OTHER MATCH, WILLIAMS HAS TO CONSIDER MUCH MORE THAN JUST FACING THE WORLDS BEST PLAYER. OF COURSE I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND I WOULD LIKE US TO HAVE THAT MOMENT SO WE CAN SEE HOW IT IS, SAID WILLIAMS, WHO NOW RANKS SECOND IN U.S. OPEN MATCH WINS, BEHIND HER SISTER. WE BOTH HAVE TO GET THERE. I THINK WE BOTH HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO, BUT THERE ARE NO GIVENS. [OUR] FIRST MATCH WAS P
775	ARCHIVE: THE LAWRENCE UNIVERSITY VOLLEYBALL TEAM, PLAGUED BY INJURIES AND NONSTOP GRUELING COMPETITION, AIMS TO GET OFF A NINE-GAME LOSING STREAK AS CONFERENCE PLAY BEGINS THIS WEEK. A SERIES OF HIGH-CALIBER TOURNAMENTS KEPT THE LADY VIKES ON THEIR TOES FOR THE ENTIRE MONTH OF SEPT., BUT IT IS TIME TO BEGIN THE REGULAR SEASON WITH STEADY FOCUS. PRE-SEASON IS ALWAYS REALLY DIFFICULT. WE HAVE PLAYED TEAMS THAT ARE RANKED AMONGST THE TOP 25 IN THE NATION, EXPLAINED SOPHOMORE COLLEEN NOWLAN, NAMING TEAMS SUCH AS ELMHURST, WHITEWATER AND EDGEWOOD. IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING, BUT WE GO BACK TO BASICS AND THE BASIC DRIVE TO WIN. A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS JUST TO CREATE THE INTENSITY ON THE COURT TO CARRY US THROUGH THE REGULAR SEASON. ON SEPT. 1, LAWRENCE TRAVELED TO MILWAUKEE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING (MSOE) TO TAKE ON THE RAIDERS AS WELL AS WISCONSIN LUTHERAN COLLEGE IN A TOUGH DOUBLE DUAL RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THE VIKINGS FELL TO BOTH OPPONENTS AS THEY WERE STILL RECOVERING FROM PRE-SEASON CAMPS DEMANDING TRAINING PROGRAM. AT TIMES, THAT PROGRAM LED TO ACHES AND PAINS AS WELL AS MORE SERIOUS INJURIES ON THE TEAM. I SPRAINED MY ANKLE DURING CAMP WEEK. I WAS OUT FOR A WHILE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE FRACTURED IT, SAID NOWLAN. SOME FRESHMEN CAME IN WITH INJURIES FROM THE PAST, AND WITH MULTIPLE TWICE-A-DAYS AND THE INTENSE PRACTICES, THEY KIND OF WORSENED. THAT ESCALATED TO PEOPLE SITTING OUT. FOR OUR SENIORS I THINK IT IS JUST WEAR AND TEAR ON THEIR BODIES. WE DO A LOT OF HARD WORKOUTS. WE LIFT, PRACTICE TWICE A DAY AND RUN A LOT.  IT KNOCKED US ALL OUT. JUST DAYS AFTER THE MSOE DOUBLE DUAL, LU TRAVELED TO ELMHURST COLLEGE IN ILLINOIS FOR A TWO-DAY INVITATIONAL. IN ATTENDANCE WERE ST.  THIS TOURNAMENT OFFERED A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY CHALLENGING, OUT-OF-STATE TEAMS THAT THE VIKINGS DO NOT NORMALLY SEE. LAWRENCE RETURNED TO APPLETON AT THE END OF THE WEEKEND WITH A 3-1 RECORD, DEFEATING FONTBONNE 3-1 IN THE FINAL GAME OF THE INVITATIONAL. THE VOLLEYBALL TEAMS HOME OPENER AGAINST MARIAN COLLEGE ON SEPT. 9 WAS HARD-FOUGHT AND EXCITING TO WATCH, BUT THE VIKINGS FELL 3-1, THE SCORE OF THE FINAL SET A CLOSE 25-23. FOLLOWING THEIR FIRST HOME GAME, THE LADY VIKES PRE-SEASON WAS MADE UP OF MORE COMPETITION AGAINST MANY ELITE OPPONENTS SUCH AS ST.  THE S&P 500 INDEX SHOWED ONLY ONE NEW 52-WEEK HIGH AND 10 NEW LOWS. OLAF, UW-STEVENS POINT AND EDGEWOOD COLLEGE. DURING THOSE PRE-SEASON GAMES WE DID A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL WORK FOR THOSE THAT WERE IN, SAYS NOWLAN. HITTING, GETTING THE FOOTWORK DOWN TO MAYBE PREVENT SOME INJURIES. BY FRIDAY, JUST ABOUT EVERYONE WAS BACK. OUR COACH HAS LESSENED SOME OF IT. WE DO NOT DO STAIRS ANYMORE. IN GAMES, HE WILL THROW SOMEONE ELSE IN TO GIVE SOMEONE A BREAK. WE ARE GOING INTO CONFERENCE COMPETITION NOW SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR LINEUP IS STEADY. THAT LINEUP INCLUDES A NOTABLY YOUNG AND TALENTED TEAM. VIKING VOLLEYBALL HAS NO JUNIORS THIS YEAR AND ONLY TWO SENIORS.  SENIOR TERESE SWORDS HAS BEEN DEALING WITH A SHOULDER INJURY, BUT THE TEAM IS OPTIMISTIC THAT SHE WILL RECOVER QUICKLY ENOUGH TO PLAY THE SECOND HALF OF THE SEASON. THE OTHER SENIOR, MEGAN CONLEY, IS CURRENTLY WAITING TO HEAR DETAILS ON A HIP INJURY WHICH COULD BE LONG-TERM OR COULD HAVE A QUICK TURNOVER AND HAVE HER BACK ON THE COURT PLAYING AS NEEDED. FRESHMAN NICOLE WITMER, WHO HAS BEEN DOING REHAB FOR AN ACHILLES INJURY, RETURNED TO PRACTICE JUST IN TIME FOR THE REGULAR SEASON. OUR YOUNG TEAM IS GOING REALLY WELL, FIGURING OUT TEAM CHEMISTRY, REVEALED NOWLAN. OFF THE COURT, WERE REALLY CLOSE. WERE ALL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER AND JOKE AROUND A LOT. WERE ALL SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER ON THE COURT. THERES REALLY NOT A LOT OF UNDERLYING COMPETITION. WE WANT EVERYONE TO SUCCEED. ON WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 23, THE VIKINGS HOSTED CARROLL UNIVERSITY, WHOSE 3-10 RECORD GOING INTO CONFERENCE COMPETITION WAS WITHIN REACH OF LAWRENCES TOUGH 1-14 RECORD. THE PIONEERS PLAYED SOME COMPARABLE PRE-SEASON GAMES, LOSING TO SIMILAR TEAMS LIKE WISCONSIN LUTHERAN, MSOE, UW-OSHKOSH AND ELMHURST, ALONG WITH SOME OTHER CHALLENGING OPPONENTS SUCH AS UW-EAU CLAIRE, UW-PLATTEVILLE AND CARTHAGE COLLEGE. TWO MORE HOME GAMES WILL GIVE LAWRENCE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN SOME MOMENTUM FOR THE CONFERENCE SEASON.  WHOOP , A PROVIDER OF WEARABLE DEVICES, HAS RAISED $12 MILLION FROM MULTIPLE INVESTORS... ON FRIDAY, SEPT. 25, GRINNELL COLLEGE WILL CHALLENGE THE VIKINGS AT ALEXANDER GYMNASIUM, AND SATURDAY, SEPT. 26, IS FAMILY DAY, WHEN CORNELL COLLEGE COMES TO APPLETON TO TAKE ON THE LADY VIKES.

WHILE THE SUBJECT OF THE EVENT ISNT UNVEILED, IT SEEMS LIKELY WE COULD BE LOOKING AT LGS LATEST FLAGSHIP. EARLIER THIS YEAR, LG FIRST TEASED ABOUT ITS SUPER PREMIUM FLAGSHIP. MORE RECENTLY, WEVE SEEN THE DEVICE LEAKED IN A FEW IMAGES, AND HAVE HAD AT LEAST A FEW OTHER RUMORS THAT HELP PAINT A PICTURE OF WHAT TO EXPECT. ONE THING WE ARENT AS CLEAR ON IS THE NAME. AT ONE POINT IT WAS RUMORED TO BE THE LG G NOTEAND SOME EVEN SAID IT MIGHT BE ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE G PRO SERIES, BUT MOST RECENTLY RUMORS HAVE POINTED TOWARDS NAME LG V10, WHICH IS BACKED UP BY ITS APPEARANCE IN LEAKED IMAGES. IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLY THAT LG IS MOVING AWAY FROM THE G BRANDING WITH THIS DEVICE, THOUGH WE CANT SAY FOR SURE WHAT ITS FINAL NAME WILL BE. FOR NOW THOUGH, THE LG V10 NAMING SCHEME MAKES AS MUCH SENSE AS ANYTHING ELSE. SO WHAT DOES THE INVITE TELL US ABOUT THE V10, OR WHATEVER ELSE LG PLANS TO ANNOUNCE? NOT MUCH. THERE IS A MOVIE THEME TO THE INVITE, SUGGESTING THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME SORT OF SPECIAL VIDEO-RELATED FUNCTIONALITY. FOR EVERYTHING ELSE, WELL HAVE TO TURN TO THE RUMOR MILL.

777	THE WESTERN CAPE HIGH COURT HAS PUT THE BRAKES ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL ROADS AGENCYS (SANRALS) PLAN TO TOLL SEGMENTS OF THE N1 AND N2 IN THE PROVINCE, DEALING THE PARASTATAL A MAJOR BLOW. ON WEDNESDAY, THE COURT SET ASIDE THE PLAN IN A JUDGMENT LIKELY TO EMBOLDEN OPPONENTS OF THE AGENCYS GAUTENG E-TOLLS. THE COURT ALSO ORDERED SANRAL TO REVIEW ITS PLANS FOR THE HIGHWAYS. IN ADDITION, THE COURT SAID IF SANRAL WANTED TO PROCEED WITH THE PROJECT IT HAD TO START FROM SCRATCH AND CONDUCT A PROCESS THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY PROPER PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. THE CITY OF CAPE TOWN HAD APPROACHED THE COURT AND ACCUSED SANRAL OF NOT HAVING FOLLOWED DUE PROCESS WHEN THE ROADS AGENCY DECIDED IT WOULD TOLL THE N1 AND N2 IN THE WINELANDS. SANRALS PLAN COULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE TOLLING OF A 180KM STRETCH OF HIGHWAY IN THE WINELANDS. THE PROPOSED CONCESSION ROUTE, ALONG THE N1, GOES FROM WEST OF THE R300 INTERCHANGE TO SANDHILLS, WHILE THE N2 PORTION EXTENDS FROM WEST OF THE R300 TO BOT RIVER. ACCORDING TO THE CITY: THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS MINISTER AT THE TIME SIGNED OFF ON THE PROJECT WITHOUT CONSIDERING ITS SOCIOECONOMIC EFFECTS; THE TRANSPORT MINISTER FAILED TO CONSIDER THE MERITS AND EFFECTS OF TOLLING; AND SANRALS BOARD WAS UNABLE TO PRODUCE A RECORD OF ITS DECISION TO TOLL THE ROADS, WHICH SUGGESTED THAT OUTGOING CE NAZIR ALLI MADE THE DECISION ALONE. THIS CONSTITUTED A VIOLATION OF THE SANRAL ACT, THE CITY SAID. THE CITY HAD ARGUED THAT WESTERN CAPE DRIVERS WOULD PAY TOLL TARIFFS NEARLY THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THOSE IN GAUTENG, SHOULD THE TOLLING PLAN GO AHEAD. THE PROJECTED COSTS OF THE PROJECT HAD ESCALATED FROM R1.653BN IN MARCH 2000 TO R44.970BN IN MARCH 2010 (THE 2010 VALUES EXCLUDE VALUE-ADDED TAX). THIS IS A 2,620% COST ESTIMATE SPIKE OVER 10 YEARS. BUT THIS INFORMATION WAS NOT PRESENTED TO, OR CONSIDERED BY, THE DECISION-MAKERS. IN AUGUST, SANRALS LEGAL COUNSEL, BRUCE LEECH, ASKED THE CITY WHY IT WAITED NEARLY FOUR YEARS BEFORE MOUNTING THE LEGAL CHALLENGE. THE CITY BEGAN ITS LEGAL FIGHT IN 2011, BUT THE N1 AND N2 WERE DECLARED TOLL ROADS IN SEPTEMBER 2008. MR LEACH SAID THE DELAY WAS UNREASONABLE AND MORE THAN THE 180-DAY PERIOD PRESCRIBED IN THE PROMOTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE ACT. THE AGENCY ALSO ARGUED THAT ITS FUNDING WAS LIMITED TO TWO SOURCES: APPROPRIATIONS BY PARLIAMENT AND TOLLS. IT SAID THE APPROPRIATIONS WERE INSUFFICIENT TO FUND HIGHWAY UPGRADES WHEN FACTORING IN ITS OTHER COMMITMENTS, AND IT SAID THE FUEL LEVY WAS NOT AN OPTION. THE CITY SAID ALTHOUGH IT HAD DELAYED APPROACHING THE COURTS, THE JUDGES SHOULD WEIGH THIS AGAINST AN "UNLAWFULLY BUILT" TOLL PROJECT "THAT WILL AFFECT ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OVER A PERIOD OF 30 YEARS". OUTSIDE THE COURT BUILDING, SANRAL PROJECT MANAGER TIAGO MASSINGUE SAID THE AGENCY WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE JUDGMENT AND A DETAILED STATEMENT WOULD BE RELEASED SOON. BRETT HERRON, CAPE TOWNS MAYORAL COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR TRANSPORT, SAID ON WEDNESDAY THE RULING IS THE CITYS SECOND LEGAL VICTORY AGAINST SANRAL, AND SHOULD SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT THE AGENCY HAS REACHED THE END OF THE ROAD AS FAR AS THE WINELANDS TOLLING PROJECT IS CONCERNED. "THE RULING VINDICATES THE CITYS FIRM BELIEF THAT THE PROCESS UNDERTAKEN BY SANRAL TO DECLARE PORTIONS OF THE N1 AND N2 AS TOLL ROADS WAS IMPROPER AND UNLAWFUL. "IT IS ALSO HIGH TIME THAT SANRAL STOP BLAMING THE CITY OF CAPE TOWN FOR NEGLECTING TO UNDERTAKE MUCH-NEEDED ROAD MAINTENANCE ALONG THE N1 AND N2 FREEWAYS AND UPGRADES TO THE HUGUENOT TUNNEL," MR HERRON SAID.
778	STILL UNBEATEN IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP THIS SEASON AND NOW UP TO SECOND PLACE AFTER YESTERDAYS 2-0 HOME WIN OVER HUDDERSFIELD, THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT CARDIFF CITY HAVE STARTED 2015/16 FAR BETTER THAN MANY, INCLUDING MYSELF, WERE EXPECTING. YET, GIVEN WHAT WAS ON OFFER FOR ALL BUT THE FINAL QUARTER OF YESTERDAYS ENCOUNTER, IT WAS EASY TO UNDERSTAND FIRST, WHY ONLY THIRTEEN AND A HALF THOUSAND BOTHERED TO TURN UP AND, SECOND, WHY THE ATMOSPHERE WAS AS FLAT THROUGHOUT AS IT WAS AT ANY TIME LAST SEASON. THERE WERE SO MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN YESTERDAYS GAME AND THE ONE WITH WOLVES THREE WEEKS AGO IT WAS UNCANNY. A MISLEADINGLY BRIGHT START WHICH SAW KENWYNE JONES HAVE A SHOT BEATEN AWAY BY VISITING KEEPER GED STEER WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES AND JOE MASON SHOOT NOT TOO FAR WIDE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS PROBABLY MEANT THAT WE LOOKED SLIGHTLY MORE DANGEROUS IN THE FIRST FORTY MINUTES THAN WE DID AGAINST WOLVES, BUT IT REALLY WAS TURGID STUFF AGAIN AS WE FOUGHT OUT A, MOSTLY LOSING, BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO PENALTY AREAS AGAINST A TEAM WHO HAD NOT WON A GAME YET. IRONICALLY, I BELIEVE THE ONE OF OUR THREE LEAGUE MATCHES WE DIDNT WIN (FULHAM) SAW US PRODUCE OUR BEST FOOTBALLING DISPLAY AT HOME SO FAR AND WEVE ALSO PLAYED SOME GOOD STUFF AT QPR AND FOREST. HOWEVER,SO MANY OF OUR HOME GAMES UNDER THIS MANAGER, AND THE PREVIOUS ONE, HAVE FELT FLAT AND LACKING IN THE SORT OF THINGS I STARTED GOING TO WATCH MY TEAM PLAY FOR OF COURSE, ITS GOOD TO WIN GAMES, BUT I COME OUT OF THEM THESE DAYS WITHOUT THAT FEELING OF ELATION I USED TO GET WHEN WED TAKEN THE POINTS. ALTHOUGH THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CLUB AND I IS AS STRONG AS IT EVER WAS IN TERMS OF ME ATTENDING MATCHES, I, INCREASINGLY, BELIEVE THAT THE REBRAND, OUR FARCICAL SEASON IN A LEAGUE ID WAITED NEARLY THREE SCORE YEARS TO SEE US PLAY IN AND THE THOROUGHLY MISERABLE EXPERIENCE THAT WAS SEASON 2014/15 HAVE TAKEN A BIGGER TOLL ON ME THAN I FIRST SUPPOSED IT IS STILL MY CLUB AND I WANT TO FEEL LIKE I USED TO ABOUT IT, BUT, DESPITE THE PROMISING START, ITS JUST NOT HAPPENING YET FOR ME THIS SEASON. NOW, I ACCEPT THAT IS A HARSH JUDGEMENT AFTER WEVE JUST RECORDED OUR THIRD SUCCESSIVE WIN AND FIND OURSELVES IN ONE OF THE AUTOMATIC PROMOTION POSITIONS (OKAY, I REALISE THAT MEANS VERY LITTLE IN MID SEPTEMBER, BUT IT SHOULD STILL CREATE A FEELGOOD FACTOR AND A BUZZ AROUND A CLUB WHICH IM NOT AWARE OF WITH CITY AT THE MOMENT), BUT IM AFRAID THATS HOW I FEEL AND ID BE VERY SURPRISED IF THERE ARENT OTHERS WHO ECHO THOSE SENTIMENTS. JUST AS AGAINST WOLVES, THERE WERE LONG PERIODS OF PLAY WHERE NOTHING AT ALL WAS HAPPENING FROM A CITY POINT OF VIEW, BUT, UNLIKE IN THE PREVIOUS HOME GAME, I DIDNT HAVE THE FEELING THAT, AT LEAST WE NEVER REALLY LOOKED LIKE CONCEDING A GOAL WE WERE SO ORDINARY IN THE FIRST SIXTY FIVE MINUTES AND HUDDERSFIELD WERE WINNING SO MANY OF THE FIFTY/FIFTY BALLS THAT I FEEL SURE THAT MORE CONFIDENT OPPONENTS WOULD HAVE PUNISHED US. CITY WERE FORCED INTO AN EARLY CHANGE YESTERDAY AS LEE PELTIER WAS REPLACED BY SCOTT MALONE AFTER THE FULL BACK HAD BEEN FOULED BY JOHNATHAN HOGG HOGG RECEIVED A YELLOW CARD AND HAS PREVIOUS AT THIS GROUND FOR POOR TACKLES ON CITY PLAYERS AS IT WAS HIS TACKLE WHICH LED TO CRAIG CONWAY SPENDING MONTHS IN THE TREATMENT TABLE IN 2012.* EVENTUALLY, CITY EMERGED COMFORTABLE WINNERS AGAINST WOLVES AND THE SINGLE THING WHICH MADE THAT HAPPEN WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF SAMMY AMEOBI FOR KENWYNE JONES EARLY IN THE SECOND HALF. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE SAME SWITCH AROUND THE HOUR MARK YESTERDAY HAD A SIMILAR LIFTING EFFECT ON OUR LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS BY NO MEANS A WHOLLY POPULAR DECISION BY RUSSELL SLADE AT THE TIME. SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, ALTHOUGH I WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO BOOED THE WITHDRAWAL OF JONES, I WAS SURPRISED BY IT. THE EASY CONCLUSION TO DRAW WHEN ONE PLAYER IS REPLACED ANDTHE TEAM STARTS PLAYING BETTER (ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HAPPENS IN SUCCESSIVE HOME GAMES) AFTER THE CHANGE IS THATHE SHOULD LOSE HIS PLACE IN THE STARTING LINE UP, BUT I DONT THINK ITS AS SIMPLE AS THAT HERE. ALTHOUGH NOT IN FULL COULDNT CARE LESS MODE, THERE WERE TRACES OF IT ON SHOW YESTERDAY FROM KENWYNE, BUT, EVEN SO, THERE WERE ALSO OCCASIONAL MOMENTS OF QUALITY LIKE WHEN HE BEAT A MAN OUT ON THE TOUCHLINE INSIDE HIS OWN HALF AND THEN HIT A FIFTY YARD PASS THAT ONLY JUST FAILED TO PUT JOE MASON IN ON GOAL AND HOW HE ROLLED HIS MARKER TO SET UP A CHANCE HE SHOULD HAVE MADE MORE OF REALLY JUST BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN OFF WHICH NOT MANY STRIKERS IN THIS LEAGUE CAN MATCH. HE WAS ALSO PLAYING WELL AGAINST WOLVES THE FACT THIS WAS NOT APPARENT IN THE TEAM PERFORMANCE HAD MORE TO DO WITH THE FAILINGS OF THOSE AROUND HIM THAN HIS OWN SHORTCOMINGS. AS FOR AMEOBI, HE FINDS HIMSELF IN A STRANGE POSITION IN THAT WHILE HE IS MAKING A BIG IMPACT FROM THE BENCH, THE FACT THAT HE IS DOING SO AGAINST DEFENCES WHICH HAVE BEEN WORN DOWN TO SOME EXTENT AT LEAST BY THE PHYSICAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY MARKING JONES AND THE EFFECTS OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH MASONS MOVEMENT MEANS IT MUST BE VERY TEMPTING FOR RUSSELL SLADE TO LEAVE THINGS AS THEY ARE AND KEEP ON USING HIM AS AN IMPACT SUB. EVEN THOUGH HE HAD CAUSE TO BE KNACKERED AFTER HIS FIFTY YARD RUN WHICH SAW HIM TAKE ON THREE OR FOUR OPPONENTS AND CAME OUT ON TOP IN WHAT WAS A TEST OF HIS SPEED AND STRENGTH, THE WAY AMEOBI SLOWLY WALKED BACK INTO POSITION WHILE BLOWING VERY HEAVILY PERHAPS SUGGESTS THAT HE IS STILL NOT AT PEAK FITNESS? HOWEVER, ITS GOING TO BECOME HARDER AND HARDER FOR OUR MANAGER TO JUSTIFY NOT STARTING WITH AMEOBI IF HE CONTINUES TO HAVE THE IMPACT OFF THE BENCH THAT WE SAW AGAINST WOLVES AND HUDDERSFIELD. ITS JUST THAT WITH THIS MANAGERS DEVOTION TO THE 4-4-2 CAUSE, I DONT SEE IT BEING AT JONES OR MASONS EXPENSE UNLESS THEY GET INJURED I BELIEVE ITS MORE LIKELY THAT HE WILL GET THAT STARING PLACE ON THE WING IF IT COMES. WHILE THERE WAS NO DENYING AMEOBIS BIG PART IN THE FIRST GOAL (FINISHED IN THE SORT OF MANNER WHICH SUGGESTS THAT ANTHONY PILKINGTON SHOULD HAVE SCORED MORE GOALS FOR US IN WHAT, TO BE FAIR, HAS BEEN AN INJURY HIT FIRST YEAR AT THE CLUB) AND THE PART HE PLAYED IN THE SECOND ONE, I THINK THE RAISING OF OUR GAME IN THE MINUTES LEADING UP TO THE OPENING GOAL HAD AN AWFUL LOT TO DO WITH PETER WHITTINGHAM REMINDING PEOPLE LIKE ME, WHO HAVE TENDED TO QUESTION HIS PLACE IN THE TEAM IN THE LAST SEASON OR TWO, WHAT HE IS STILL CAPABLE OF GIVING US. WHITTINGHAMS SHOT FROM TWENTY FIVE YARDS BEAT STEER, BUT ALSO FLASHED JUST THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST AS WE ENTERED THE PHASE WHICH DECIDED THE GAME. FOLLOWING THIS, HE THEN REVERTED TO HIS QUARTERBACK ROLE ASHE FIRST FOUND MASON TO SEND THE STRIKER ON A RUN WHICH ENDED WITH A SHOT WHICH STEER HELD EASILY AND THEN FREED AMEOBI WITH A LOVELY BALL WHICH SPLIT THE VISITORS OFFSIDE TRAP IN THE MOVE WHICH ENDED WITH PILKINGTON SCORING. THAT FIVE MINUTES FROM WHITTINGHAM WAS A THROWBACK TO THE EARLY DAYS OF OUR CHAMPIONSHIP WINNING SEASON WHEN HE WAS A LEADING FACTOR IN A SERIES OF ENTERTAINING HOME WINS (WOLVES, BLACKPOOL, BURNLEY AND HULL SPRING TO MIND) WHICH HAVE TENDED TO BE FORGOTTEN ABOUT NOW IN MANY PEOPLES RUSH TO LABEL THE 12/13 SIDE AS BORING. YES, MUCH OF THE STUFF THE TITLE WINNERS PRODUCED FROM ABOUT NOVEMBER ONWARDS WAS FAR MORE ROUNDHEAD THAN CAVALIER, BUT THE MESSAGE HAD BEEN SENT OUT EARLY ON THAT CITY HAD THE CAPABILITY OF PUTTING OPPONENTS TO THE SWORD WHEN THEY WANTED TO (IT SHOULDNT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THEY DID THIS IN LATE SEASON HOME WINS OVER BLACKBURN AND FOREST EITHER). AT THE MOMENT, I SEE SOME COMPARISONS WITH OUR CHAMPIONSHIP WINNING TEAM IN THE WAY WE HAVE GROUND OUT A COUPLE OF HOME WINS, BUT I DONT BELIEVE AMEOBI ALONE IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE US WITH THAT LITTLE BIT EXTRA WHICH GIVES A TEAM MORE THAN JUST THE OPTION OF WINNING UGLY. SO MANY CHAMPIONSHIP MATCHES ARE A REAL SLOG AND SO THE TEAMS WHO MASTER THE KNACK OF WINNING UGLY ARE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE. HOWEVER, TO GET TO THE PREMIER LEAGUE, I THINK YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SOMETIMES SHOW THAT BIT OF QUALITY WHICH YOUR OPPONENTS CANNOT COPE WITH THAT SOMETHING WHICH GOES BEYOND JUST WINNING UGLY AND, BASED ON WHAT IVE SEEN OF THIS GROUP OF PLAYERS DURING THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS OR SO WHEN RESULTS HAVE BEEN LARGELY GOOD, IVE NOT BEEN CONVINCED THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT ON A CONSISTENT ENOUGH BASIS. CERTAINLY, IT WILL HELP A LOT IF WHITTINGHAM CAN HAVE A FEW MORE OF THOSE SPELLS WHEN HE ROLLS BACK THE YEARS LIKE HE DID YESTERDAY AND IF JONES CAN APPLY THE CONSIDERABLE TALENTS HE HAS BY THE STANDARDS OF THIS LEAGUE ON A MORE CONSISTENT BASIS. HOWEVER, I REMAIN TO BE CONVINCED THAT THIS SQUAD HAS ENOUGH STARDUST IN IT TO JUSTIFY SOME OF THE CLAIMS BEING MADE ON ITS BEHALF THAT I HEARD ON RADIO WALES PHONE IN PROGRAMME LAST NIGHT ABOUT TOP SIX FINISHES. THATS PROBABLY WHY THIS PIECE HAS ENDED UP BEING MORE NEGATIVE THAN I INTENDED IT TO BE. OF COURSE IM PLEASED TO SEE US WHERE WE ARE IN THE TABLE WHILE STILL BEING UNBEATEN, BUT IM NOT GETTING THAT FEELING WHICH HAS ME LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT MATCH AS SOON AS THE LAST ONE ENDS AT THE MOMENT. WATCHING US PLAY AT HOME ESPECIALLY IS STILL HEAVY GOING AND IT IS AT HOME, NOT AWAY. THAT TEAMS SEIZE THE IMAGINATION OF THEIR SUPPORTERS. THE CLUB WILL BE CONCERNED TO SEE ATTENDANCES STILL HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION DESPITE OUR GOOD START THERE ARE PLENTY OF REASONS FOR THIS, BUT A HOME GAME WHICH REALLY SEIZED THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION (THE DRAW WITH MAN UNITED NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO IS THE LAST TIME I CAN REMEMBER THIS HAPPENING) MIGHT IMPROVE MATTERS A BIT*. IN ADDED TIME YESTERDAY WE HAD A FREE KICK BY THE CORNER FLAG FROM WHICH AMEOBI WAS ABLE TO WORK HIMSELF INTO A DANGEROUS POSITION ON THE BYE LINE, BUT HE THEN HAD NO OPTION THAN TO BLAST THE BALL ACROSS GOAL, PRESUMABLY IN THE HOPE THAT IT WOULD HIT A HUDDERSFIELD PLAYER AND REBOUND INTO THE NET, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE WITHIN TWENTY YARDS OF THE GOAL IN A BLUE SHIRT FOR HIM TO PICK OUT THEY WERE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE DEFENDING OUR OWN GOAL. NOW, I CAN FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY ANY SIDE WOULD DO THAT WHEN THEY WERE DEFENDING A ONE GOAL LEAD, BUT A TWO GOAL ONE? WHY COULDNT WE GO FOR THE JUGULAR AND TRY TO PROVIDE A BIT MORE ENTERTAINMENT FOR SUPPORTERS WHO HAVE HAD PRECIOUS LITTLE OF THAT COMMODITY IN RECENT YEARS? IT ALL SEEMED SO TYPICALLY RUSSELL SLADE TO ME. ACTUALLY, THATS NOT FAIR ON OUR MANAGER, BECAUSE WEVE BEEN THAT SORT OF SIDE FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER, BUT I CANT HELP THINKING THAT THE CLUB (WHO, TO BE FAIR, ARE TRYING TO RECONNECT WITH THEIR SUPPORT) AS A WHOLE COULD BENEFIT ON SO MANY LEVELS FROM A MORE POSITIVE ON FIELD ATTITUDE IN MATTERS LIKE THIS WE ALWAYS LOOK LIKE A TEAM THAT IS DOING JUST ENOUGH TO WIN OUR HOME GAMES. I SAY THAT KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THERE WERE TIMES NOT SO LONG AGO WHEN I WOULD GLADLY HAVE ACCEPTED ANY HOME WIN NO MATTER HOW IT ARRIVED AND THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN TIMES A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN 20,000 PLUS WERE GOING TO BE THERE NEXT GAME NO MATTER HOW POORLY WE PLAYED, BUT THOSE DAYS HAVE GONE NOW. DESPITE RESULTS GETTING BETTER, GATES ARE STILL GOING DOWN (EACH HOME LEAGUE GAME SO FAR HAS SEEN A DECLINE OF AROUND A THOUSAND IN THE ATTENDANCE FIGURE), SO IM NOT SURE THAT WINS ALONE WILL BE ENOUGH TO SEE ATTENDANCES CLIMB TO THE SORT OF LEVELS WEVE GOT USED TO AT CARDIFF CITY STADIUM - TO BE MORE ACCURATE, IM NOT CONVINCED THAT JUST DOING ENOUGH WINS ARE GOING TO DO THE TRICK. *PICTURES COURTESY OF HTTPS://WWW.FLICKR.COM/PHOTOS/JONCANDY/ALBUMS/WITH/72157658111560859

BARTKOWSKI IS THE SECOND TANEV IN THE MAKING, WITH GREAT MOBILITY AND PUCK-MOVING SKILLS. COMING TO VANCOUVER FROM AN ILL-SPOKEN BOSTON LOCKER ROOM, BARTKOWSKI IS LOOKING TO START ALL OVER AGAIN, AFTER SIGNING A NEW ONE-YEAR, $1.75M DEAL. ONE REASON FOR EARLY OPTIMISM FOR THIS SIGNING IS HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE CANUCKS PRESEASON GAMES. AFTER A COUPLE RUSTY SHIFTS, BARTKOWSKI TURNED ON HIS GAME AND SHOWED US WHY WE HAD PAID TO LAND HIM VIA FREE AGENCY. HIS TRANSITION PLAY WAS SPECTACULAR, AND HIS UP-ICE VISION MADE THE FORWARDS LIVES EASIER GOING UP THE ICE.

BARTKOWSKI IS COMING OFF A SEASON WITH JUST FOUR ASSISTS IN 47 GAMES, A DECLINE FROM HIS PRODUCTION FROM TWO YEARS AGO WHEN HE PLAYED A TOP-4 ROLE WITH THE BRUINS. HOWEVER, AS A DEFENSEMAN, HIS YEAR WILL NOT BE GAUGED JUST BASED ON HIS POINT TOTALS.  I AM LEARNING THAT THERE IS MORE HEARTACHE AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE WORLD THAN I EVER KNEW.  WHEN I SEE ANY OF MY GRANDCHILDREN I SEE A CONNECTION TO TERRY, BECAUSE THEY ARE OURS.

784	GAINESVILLE - HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT RECEIVED NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR ITS NEW LOGO DESIGN PROJECT DURING LAST WEEK'S 3CMA CONFERENCE IN ATLANTA. 3CMA, THE CITY-COUNTY COMMUNICATIONS AND MARKETING ASSOCIATION, IS A NETWORK OF PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC COMMUNICATORS AND MARKETERS FROM ALL OVER THE NATION. THE ORGANIZATION'S ANNUAL SAVVY AWARDS COMPETITION RECOGNIZES OUTSTANDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACHIEVEMENTS IN COMMUNICATIONS, PUBLIC-SECTOR MARKETING AND CITIZEN-GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS.  "THE LOGO DESIGN PROJECT WAS TRULY A GRASSROOTS EFFORT, LAUNCHED WITH THE INPUT OF CITIZENS AND EMPLOYEES," HALL COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR RANDY KNIGHTON SAID. "WE ARE HONORED TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE THOROUGH AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROCESS WE USED TO PRODUCE A QUALITY BRAND THAT TRULY EXEMPLIFIES HALL COUNTY'S UNIQUE ASSETS." THE LOGO FEATURES TWO FLOWING BLUE STRIPES, A SOFT GREEN ARC AND THE IMAGE OF A RISING YELLOW SUN, COMPLETE WITH "RAYS" IN THE SHAPE OF MECHANICAL COGS. EACH ELEMENT OF THE LOGO HIGHLIGHTS A DISTINCT CHARACTERISTIC OF HALL COUNTY. "THE BLUE STREAKS REPRESENT LAKE LANIER, AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF HALL COUNTY'S LANDSCAPE AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE," SAID KATIE CRUMLEY, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER FOR HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT. "THE BLUE LINES ALSO RESEMBLE ROADWAYS, GIVING A NOD TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE HALL COUNTY PROVIDES AND MAINTAINS FOR ITS CITIZENS." CRUMLEY SAID THE GREEN ARC IS REMINISCENT OF HALL COUNTY'S LOCATION AT THE FOOTHILLS OF THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS AND THE AREA'S RICH AGRICULTURAL HERITAGE. THE RISING SUN REPRESENTS THE COUNTY'S CURRENT STATE OF GROWTH AND POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. "THE MECHANICAL COGS SEEN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SUN ALSO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE FACT THAT HALL COUNTY IS MOVING FORWARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND THRIVE IN THE FUTURE," SHE SAID. THE JUDGES FOR THE 5CMA SAVVY COMPETITION PRAISED HALL COUNTY FOR CITIZEN AND EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT AND THEIR IMPRESSIVE BRAND IDENTITY STANDARD GUIDE. HALL COUNTY BEGAN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A NEW LOGO IN 2513 WITH A COUNTYWIDE SURVEY AVAILABLE ON THE COUNTY'S WEBSITE, HALLCOUNTY.ORG. THE SURVEY ASKED FOR FEEDBACK FROM HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND HALL COUNTY RESIDENTS ABOUT WHAT IMAGES, COLORS, FONTS AND MORE SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN THE NEW DESIGN. THE SURVEY ALSO ASKED WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN A FOCUS GROUP DEDICATED TO EXPOUNDING ON THE SURVEY RESPONSES. TWO FOCUS GROUPS, ONE INVOLVING CITIZENS AND ONE INVOLVING HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, WERE HELD TO GARNER MORE INPUT ON THE LOGO DESIGN AND SLOGAN. FOLLOWING THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CITIZEN AND EMPLOYEE INPUT, FORUM COMMUNICATIONS,A LOCAL FULL-SERVICE STRATEGIC MARKETING AGENCY , WAS HIRED AS A CONSULTANT FOR THE ACTUAL DESIGN OF THE LOGO.  WE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASED COLLABORATION AND PLANNING COORDINATION, AND SHARING OF RESOURCES, THEREBY MAXIMIZING THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS OF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, AND BEYOND. USING INPUT GENERATED FROM CITIZEN SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS, SEVERAL LOGO OPTIONS WERE DEVELOPED. THOSE OPTIONS WERE REVISED AND NARROWED DOWN BY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND HALL COUNTY STAFF UNTIL THE FINAL LOGO DESIGN WAS COMPLETE. THE NEW LOGO DESIGN AND SLOGAN WERE A PART OF A LARGER REBRANDING EFFORT, WHICH INCLUDED A REDESIGN OF THE COUNTY WEBSITE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONAL VALUES AND THE RELEASE OF A HALL COUNTY PROMOTIONAL VIDEO.
785	SOURCE: IRANNEWSUPDATE.COM BY INU STAFF INU - THE AUTUMN SESSION OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL WAS OPENED ON MONDAY AND IS SCHEDULED TO CONTINUE UNTIL THE FIRST WEEK OF OCTOBER. SOME IRANIAN HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS ARE USING THIS OCCASION AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECALL ATTENTION TO A VARIETY OF ONGOING AND SYSTEMIC HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC. A HANDFUL OF STORIES HAVE ALREADY EMERGED IN SERVICE OF THIS PROJECT THIS WEEK, BEGINNING WITH THE NEWS OF THE POSSIBLE ASSASSINATION IN PRISON OF LABOR RIGHTS ACTIVIST SHAHROKH ZAMANI. THE VIOLENT TREATMENT OF ACTIVISTS ALSO RECALLS ATTENTION TO THE CRIMINALIZATION OF HONEST SOCIAL AND POLITICAL REPORTING IN THE COUNTRY. JOURNALISTS TOO HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THE SORTS OF ABUSE THAT APPARENTLY KILLED ZAMANI. DEMONSTRATING THIS FACT, IRANWIRE AND ITS SISTER SITE JOURNALISM IS NOT A CRIME BOTH REPORTED UPON THE CONCLUSION OF A STUDY BY A UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO PSYCHIATRY PROFESSOR, WHICH FOUND THAT ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE IRANIAN JOURNALISTS INTERVIEWED FOR THE STUDY HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT SOME POINT. ABOUT 20 PERCENT HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TORTURE. ADDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF THIS STUDY, IRANWIRE INTERVIEWED DAVID OEHLENSCHLAEGER, THE DIRECTOR OF REHABILITATION AT DIGNITY, A FACILITY THAT SPECIALIZES IN TRAUMA REHABILITATION FOR VICTIMS OF TORTURE. HE NOTED THAT ONE OF THE LARGEST GROUPS THEY DEAL WITH IS COMPRISED OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TORTURED BY THE IRANIAN REGIME. BOTH REPORTS ALSO DETAILED HOW THE EXPERIENCE OF TORTURE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO MANY INSTANCES OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND DEPRESSION AMONG MEMBERS OF THE IRANIAN DIASPORA. IT HAS ALSO DISCOURAGED PEOPLE FROM CONTINUING IN THE JOURNALISM PROFESSION OR AT LEAST FROM KEEPING ON WITH PARTICULAR PROJECTS, IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD EITHER THEIR OWN LIVES OR THOSE OF THEIR FAMILY. NEARLY 80 PERCENT OR PARTICIPANTS IN THE STUDY REPORTED THAT THEIR WORK HAD BEEN HALTED BY THE REGIMES REPRESSION, AND HALF OF ALL PARTICIPANTS SAID THAT THREATS HAD NOT BEEN LIMITED TO THEM BUT HAD INCLUDED THEIR FAMILIES. IN LIGHT OF ALL THESE STATISTICS, ONE COULD SAY THAT JOURNALISTS COLLECTIVELY COMPRISE A SIGNIFICANT UNDERCLASS OF IRANIAN SOCIETY THAT IS SUBJECT TO SYSTEMATIC ABUSE AND REPRESSION IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES. HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS HAVE CONTINUALLY REPORTED ON THE PLIGHT OF IRANIANS WHO MAINTAIN FAITHS OTHER THAN SHIITE ISLAM. OF THESE, THE FOLLOWERS OF FAITHS THAT ORIGINATED IN THE AREA OF IRAN ARE TARGETED WITH PARTICULAR AGGRESSION, AND THE MOST PROMINENT OF THESE IS THE BAHAI FAITH. THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS NEWS AGENCY REITERATED ONE ASPECT OF THIS ABUSE ON SUNDAY, NAMELY THE BARRING OF BAHAI STUDENTS FROM ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. HRANA REPORTS THAT AHEAD OF THE CURRENT ACADEMIC YEAR, A NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FROM BAHAI STUDENTS HAVE BEEN DENIED VIA A MESSAGE THAT SIMPLY DECLARES THEIR FILES TO BE INCOMPLETE. THERE IS NO RECOURSE FOR PROTESTING SUCH ARBITRARY REJECTIONS, AND LOCAL BAHAIS ALONG WITH HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH AN ALTERNATIVE COURSE OF EDUCATION OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICIAL IRANIAN SYSTEM. BUT THESE EFFORTS TOO HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BY THE IRANIAN AUTHORITIES, WHO RAIDED AN CLOSED DOWN THE BAHAI INSTITUTE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION SEVERAL TIMES SINCE ITS OPENING IN 1987. WHILE THESE TYPES OF REPRESSION HAVE BEEN RELENTLESS, THE BAHAI COMPRISE ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE IRANIAN POPULATION. MUCH LARGER MINORITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO COORDINATED REPRESSION, WITH THE LARGEST OF THESE CERTAINLY BEING THE POPULATION OF WOMEN. THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF THIS COME IN THE FORM OF WOMENS SOCCER PLAYER NILUFAR ARDALAN, WHOSE NAME WAS RECENTLY REMOVED FROM THE ROSTER FOR THE IRANIAN NATIONAL INDOOR SOCCER TEAM, AFTER IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TRAVEL FOR GAMES. AT ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT IRANIAN LAW REQUIRES WOMEN TO GET PERMISSION FROM THEIR HUSBANDS BEFORE EITHER APPLYING FOR OR RENEWING A PASSPORT. AND SINCE ARDALANS PASSPORT EXPIRED, HER HUSBAND REFUSES TO ALLOW HER TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, CITING THE CLAIM THAT SHE IS NEEDED AT HOME AT A TIME WHEN THEIR SON IS BEGINNING SCHOOL. IRANWIRE INTERVIEWED LALEH EFTEKHARI, A MEMBER OF THE IRANIAN PARLIAMENTS WOMENS CAUCUS, OVER THIS STORY. BUT WHEN THEY RAISED THE QUESTION OF CHANGING THE LAW, THEY WERE REBUFFED AND EFTEKHARI DECLARED SUCH DENIALS OF THE LEGAL AUTONOMY OF WOMEN TO BE REQUIREMENTS OF SHARIA LAW. IT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN EMPHASIZED BY WOMENS RIGHTS GROUPS THAT DESPITE THE TECHNICAL PRESENCE OF A WOMENS CAUCUS, WOMEN LACK REPRESENTATION IN IRANIAN GOVERNMENT, AS FEMALE PARLIAMENTARIANS ARE LIMITED TO PERSONS WITH STRICT CONSERVATIVE VIEWS ON RELIGION AND FAMILY, LIKE EFTEKHARI. BY CONTRAST, MANY VICTIMS OF ORGANIZED REPRESSION HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO SPEAK OUT, AND ARDALAN NOW APPEARS TO BE ONE OF THEM. SHE HAS DECIDED TO GO PUBLIC WITH HER STORY AND HER REFUTATIONS OF HER HUSBANDS STATEMENTS. SOCIAL MEDIA IN PARTICULAR IS BECOMING AN OUTLET FOR HER VIEWS AND THOSE OF HER SUPPORTERS, MUCH AS IT HAS BEEN FOR WOMENS RIGHTS ACTIVISTS IN THE PAST. BUT THIS TOO HIGHLIGHTS ASPECTS OF TEHRANS REPRESSIVE MEASURES, SINCE ACTIVISTS IN GENERAL AND WOMENS RIGHTS ACTIVISTS IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO HARSH REPRISALS AND PROSECUTION AS A RESULT OF THEIR ONLINE ACTIVITIES. SOCIAL NETWORKS LIKE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER REMAIN TECHNICALLY BANNED THROUGHOUT THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC, ALTHOUGH MANY CITIZENS WORK AROUND THESE BLOCKS. THOSE WHO DO ARE IN DANGER OF BEING CHARGED WITH SPREADING PROPAGANDA OR INSULTING IRANIAN OFFICIALS IF THEY MAKE CRITICAL POSTS. FOUR NEW SUCH ARRESTS WERE ANNOUNCED BY THE JUDICIARY ON AUGUST 30. AND NOW, THE INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAN REPORTS THAT THE OFFICE OF IRANIAN SUPREME LEADER ALI KHAMENEI HAS TAKEN MEASURES TO CONSOLIDATE POWER FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF INTERNET RESTRICTIONS AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF INTERNET-BASED CRIMES. KHAMENEI REPORTEDLY ORDERED ALL DECISIONS ON INTERNET POLICY TO BE HANDLED BY THE SUPREME CYBERSPACE COUNCIL, WHICH ANSWERS DIRECTLY TO HIM, THUS CIRCUMVENTING ALL LOWER FEDERAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES. THE INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN POINTS OUT THAT IRAN IS SECOND ONLY TO CHINA IN THE NUMBER OF WEBSITES THAT ITS GOVERNMENT BLOCKS. AND IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT THIS SITUATION WILL WORSE IN LIGHT OF THE LATEST NEWS, WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEW POSTS TO THE SUPREME CYBERSPACE COUNCIL, INCLUDING TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LISTED AS VIOLATORS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY BOTH THE US AND THE EU. BY
786	WHEN OFFICIALS FROM NEW YORK CITY'S CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION WANTED TO INVESTIGATE FOOD POISONING, THEY TURNED TO YELP. THE CITY REALIZED THAT SOME PEOPLE WHO GOT SICK AFTER EATING OUT WERE MORE LIKELY TO POST BAD REVIEWS THAN CALL "311" TO FILE AN OFFICIAL REPORT. SO CITY OFFICIALS AND YELP EXAMINED NEARLY 300,000 RESTAURANT REVIEWS POSTED BETWEEN JULY 1, 2012 AND MARCH 31, 2013, SEARCHING FOR WORDS ASSOCIATED WITH FOOD POISONING. RESEARCHERS DETERMINED THAT AROUND 500 REVIEWS INCLUDED WORDS ASSOCIATED WITH FOOD POISONING, BUT LESS THAN 3% OF THE REVIEWERS HAD MADE REPORTS TO THE CITY. AFTER FOLLOWING UP WITH PHONE INTERVIEWS, INVESTIGATORS DETERMINED THERE HAD BEEN THREE UNREPORTED FOOD POISONING OUTBREAKS AT CITY RESTAURANTS. TWO OF THOSE RESTAURANTS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED DOWN FOR MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS OF THE CITY'S CODE. YELP NOW POINTS TO THAT INVESTIGATION AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHY NET NEUTRALITY RULES ARE NEEDED. "THE VALUE OF CONNECTING PEOPLE TO EACH OTHER IN REAL TIME ... CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED," YELP SAYS IN A FRIEND-OF-THE-COURT BRIEF FILED THIS WEEK WITH THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. OTHER COMPANIES SIGNING THE BRIEF ARE REDDIT, TWITTER, AUTOMATTIC (WHICH OWNS WORDPRESS), MEDIUM AND SQUARESPACE. "WHEN ONE TWITTER USER TWEETED AN OFFICIAL IN INDIA ABOUT HIS MISSING SISTER, THE MESSAGE TRIGGERED A POLITICAL RESPONSE THAT LED TO HIS SISTERS RESCUE FROM HUMAN TRAFFICKERS," THE GROUPS SAY. "WHEN YELPERS COMPLAINED ABOUT MEALS THAT MADE THEM SICK, HEALTH DEPARTMENTS USED THAT INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY PLACES REPEATEDLY ASSOCIATED WITH FOODBORNE ILLNESS." THE COMPANIES SAY THAT WITHOUT NET NEUTRALITY, PLATFORMS FOR SPEECH COULD DISAPPEAR. "FREE OR LOW COST PLATFORMS FOR USER-GENERATED CONTENT MAY NOT SURVIVE IF THEY HAVE TO SATISFY BROADBAND PROVIDERS DEMANDS TO STAY ACCESSIBLE," THE GROUPS WRITE. "PEOPLE HAVE NEVER IN HISTORY BEEN THIS EXTENSIVELY AND POWERFULLY DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER AND THE WORLD," YELP AND THE OTHERS SAY. "ALL OF THAT IS AT RISK IF BROADBAND PROVIDERS GET TO BLOCK OR LIMIT ACCESS TO THOSE VOICES THEY DECIDE TO DISFAVOR -- AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT PETITIONERS ARE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT TO DO. THAT RISK MUST NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY." THE NET NEUTRALITY RULES PROHIBIT BROADBAND PROVIDERS FROM BLOCKING OR DEGRADING CONTENT AND FROM CHARGING COMPANIES HIGHER FEES FOR FASTER DELIVERY OF THEIR TRAFFIC. THE RULES ALSO BROADLY PROHIBIT PROVIDERS FROM HINDERING THE ABILITY OF WEB USERS AND CONTENT COMPANIES TO CONNECT ONLINE. AT&T, CENTURYLINK AND VARIOUS OTHER COMPANIES AND TRADE GROUPS HAVE SUED TO VACATE THE RULES. THE FCC IS DEFENDING THE REGULATIONS. A HOST OF OUTSIDE GROUPS AND COMPANIES -- INCLUDING THE U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE , THE TRADE GROUP INTERNET ASSOCIATION AND A COALITION OF LAWMAKERS -- ARE WEIGHING IN ON THE BATTLE. THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS WILL HEAR ARGUMENTS ON DEC. 4.

BLACKBERRY PRIV EVAN BLASS (@EVLEAKS) SEPTEMBER 23, 2015 WHILE MANY PEOPLE MAY BE DISAPPOINTED IN BLACKBERRY'S NAME CHOICE FOR ITS MUCH ANTICIPATED SMARTPHONE, IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR THE COMPANY TO NAME THE DEVICE PRIV INSTEAD. IT'S SHORT AND SNAPPY, MAKING IT JUST RIGHT FOR ITS ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT STANDS FOR THE PRIVACY-MINDED FOCUS FOR ALL BLACKBERRY PRODUCTS. STILL, VENICE DOES ROLL OFF THE TONGUE QUITE NICELY. SO LONG, VENICE. HELLO, PRIV. BLASS ALSO POSTED A BRAND NEW RENDER OF THE BLACKBERRY VENICE, ERR, BLACKBERRY PRIV ON TWITTER. THE IMAGE DOESN'T TELL US ANYTHING WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW, BUT IT DOES CONFIRM EARLIER REPORTS THAT THE SMARTPHONE WILL RUN ON NEARLY STOCK ANDROID WITH A FEW BLACKBERRY FEATURES. IT ALSO SHOWS THE PHYSICAL KEYBOARD SLIDING OUT FROM UNDER THE HUGE DISPLAY, AS WELL AS THE BLACKBERRY LOGO ON TOP OF THE DISPLAY. . @CRACKBERRY THAT RENDER IS GETTING A BIT TIRED, DONTCHA THINK? PIC.TWITTER.COM/UZSANAU6DF EVAN BLASS (@EVLEAKS) SEPTEMBER 24, 2015 MEANWHILE, THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE MORE COLOR ON THE UPCOMING BLACKBERRY HANDSET MAY CHECK OUT A GROUP OF NEW RENDERS DEVELOPED BY DESIGNER @POOTERMOBILE. WHEN BLACKBERRY PRESIDENT OF DEVICES AND EMERGING SOLUTIONS RON LOUKS TEASED BLACKBERRY PRIV AT THE MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS IN MARCH, HE ONLY SHOWED A DEVICE IN BLACK AND WHITE. THESE NEW RENDERS ADDING RED, PURPLE, SILVER AND SKY BLUE, HOWEVER, LEND AN INTERESTING TWIST TO THE SMARTPHONE. WHILE THE BLACKBERRY PRIV MAY OFFICIALLY LAUNCH ONLY IN BLACK AND WHITE, IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR BLACKBERRY TO RELEASE NEW COLORS AFTERWARDS. AFTER ALL, THE SQUARE-DISPLAY BLACKBERRY PASSPORT HAD A LIMITED EDITION IN RED, AND THE REDESIGNED SMARTPHONE CAME IN SILVER. NO RELEASE DATE HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED FOR THE BLACKBERRY PRIV, BUT AS THE NUMEROUS LEAKS AND EVEN A HANDS-ON VIDEO POINT OUT, IT'S LIKE THE NEW SMARTPHONE WILL BE UNVEILED SOON ENOUGH. THE BLACKBERRY PRIV IS SHAPING UP TO BE A PRETTY INTERESTING DEVICE, WITH A SNAPDRAGON 810 SOC, 3 GB OF RAM, A 5.4-INCH QUAD HD DISPLAY, AN 18-MEGAPIXEL BACK CAMERA AND A 5-MEGAPIXEL FRONT SHOOTER.

790	STILL UNBEATEN IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP THIS SEASON AND NOW UP TO SECOND PLACE AFTER YESTERDAYS 2-0 HOME WIN OVER HUDDERSFIELD, THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT CARDIFF CITY HAVE STARTED 2015/16 FAR BETTER THAN MANY, INCLUDING MYSELF, WERE EXPECTING. YET, GIVEN WHAT WAS ON OFFER FOR ALL BUT THE FINAL QUARTER OF YESTERDAYS ENCOUNTER, IT WAS EASY TO UNDERSTAND FIRST, WHY ONLY THIRTEEN AND A HALF THOUSAND BOTHERED TO TURN UP AND, SECOND, WHY THE ATMOSPHERE WAS AS FLAT THROUGHOUT AS IT WAS AT ANY TIME LAST SEASON. THERE WERE SO MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN YESTERDAYS GAME AND THE ONE WITH WOLVES THREE WEEKS AGO IT WAS UNCANNY. A MISLEADINGLY BRIGHT START WHICH SAW KENWYNE JONES HAVE A SHOT BEATEN AWAY BY VISITING KEEPER GED STEER WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES AND JOE MASON SHOOT NOT TOO FAR WIDE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS PROBABLY MEANT THAT WE LOOKED SLIGHTLY MORE DANGEROUS IN THE FIRST FORTY MINUTES THAN WE DID AGAINST WOLVES, BUT IT REALLY WAS TURGID STUFF AGAIN AS WE FOUGHT OUT A, MOSTLY LOSING, BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO PENALTY AREAS AGAINST A TEAM WHO HAD NOT WON A GAME YET. IRONICALLY, I BELIEVE THE ONE OF OUR THREE LEAGUE MATCHES WE DIDNT WIN (FULHAM) SAW US PRODUCE OUR BEST FOOTBALLING DISPLAY AT HOME SO FAR AND WEVE ALSO PLAYED SOME GOOD STUFF AT QPR AND FOREST. HOWEVER,SO MANY OF OUR HOME GAMES UNDER THIS MANAGER, AND THE PREVIOUS ONE, HAVE FELT FLAT AND LACKING IN THE SORT OF THINGS I STARTED GOING TO WATCH MY TEAM PLAY FOR OF COURSE, ITS GOOD TO WIN GAMES, BUT I COME OUT OF THEM THESE DAYS WITHOUT THAT FEELING OF ELATION I USED TO GET WHEN WED TAKEN THE POINTS. ALTHOUGH THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CLUB AND I IS AS STRONG AS IT EVER WAS IN TERMS OF ME ATTENDING MATCHES, I, INCREASINGLY, BELIEVE THAT THE REBRAND, OUR FARCICAL SEASON IN A LEAGUE ID WAITED NEARLY THREE SCORE YEARS TO SEE US PLAY IN AND THE THOROUGHLY MISERABLE EXPERIENCE THAT WAS SEASON 2014/15 HAVE TAKEN A BIGGER TOLL ON ME THAN I FIRST SUPPOSED IT IS STILL MY CLUB AND I WANT TO FEEL LIKE I USED TO ABOUT IT, BUT, DESPITE THE PROMISING START, ITS JUST NOT HAPPENING YET FOR ME THIS SEASON. NOW, I ACCEPT THAT IS A HARSH JUDGEMENT AFTER WEVE JUST RECORDED OUR THIRD SUCCESSIVE WIN AND FIND OURSELVES IN ONE OF THE AUTOMATIC PROMOTION POSITIONS (OKAY, I REALISE THAT MEANS VERY LITTLE IN MID SEPTEMBER, BUT IT SHOULD STILL CREATE A FEELGOOD FACTOR AND A BUZZ AROUND A CLUB WHICH IM NOT AWARE OF WITH CITY AT THE MOMENT), BUT IM AFRAID THATS HOW I FEEL AND ID BE VERY SURPRISED IF THERE ARENT OTHERS WHO ECHO THOSE SENTIMENTS. JUST AS AGAINST WOLVES, THERE WERE LONG PERIODS OF PLAY WHERE NOTHING AT ALL WAS HAPPENING FROM A CITY POINT OF VIEW, BUT, UNLIKE IN THE PREVIOUS HOME GAME, I DIDNT HAVE THE FEELING THAT, AT LEAST WE NEVER REALLY LOOKED LIKE CONCEDING A GOAL WE WERE SO ORDINARY IN THE FIRST SIXTY FIVE MINUTES AND HUDDERSFIELD WERE WINNING SO MANY OF THE FIFTY/FIFTY BALLS THAT I FEEL SURE THAT MORE CONFIDENT OPPONENTS WOULD HAVE PUNISHED US. CITY WERE FORCED INTO AN EARLY CHANGE YESTERDAY AS LEE PELTIER WAS REPLACED BY SCOTT MALONE AFTER THE FULL BACK HAD BEEN FOULED BY JOHNATHAN HOGG HOGG RECEIVED A YELLOW CARD AND HAS PREVIOUS AT THIS GROUND FOR POOR TACKLES ON CITY PLAYERS AS IT WAS HIS TACKLE WHICH LED TO CRAIG CONWAY SPENDING MONTHS IN THE TREATMENT TABLE IN 2012.* EVENTUALLY, CITY EMERGED COMFORTABLE WINNERS AGAINST WOLVES AND THE SINGLE THING WHICH MADE THAT HAPPEN WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF SAMMY AMEOBI FOR KENWYNE JONES EARLY IN THE SECOND HALF. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE SAME SWITCH AROUND THE HOUR MARK YESTERDAY HAD A SIMILAR LIFTING EFFECT ON OUR LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS BY NO MEANS A WHOLLY POPULAR DECISION BY RUSSELL SLADE AT THE TIME. SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, ALTHOUGH I WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO BOOED THE WITHDRAWAL OF JONES, I WAS SURPRISED BY IT. THE EASY CONCLUSION TO DRAW WHEN ONE PLAYER IS REPLACED ANDTHE TEAM STARTS PLAYING BETTER (ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HAPPENS IN SUCCESSIVE HOME GAMES) AFTER THE CHANGE IS THATHE SHOULD LOSE HIS PLACE IN THE STARTING LINE UP, BUT I DONT THINK ITS AS SIMPLE AS THAT HERE. ALTHOUGH NOT IN FULL COULDNT CARE LESS MODE, THERE WERE TRACES OF IT ON SHOW YESTERDAY FROM KENWYNE, BUT, EVEN SO, THERE WERE ALSO OCCASIONAL MOMENTS OF QUALITY LIKE WHEN HE BEAT A MAN OUT ON THE TOUCHLINE INSIDE HIS OWN HALF AND THEN HIT A FIFTY YARD PASS THAT ONLY JUST FAILED TO PUT JOE MASON IN ON GOAL AND HOW HE ROLLED HIS MARKER TO SET UP A CHANCE HE SHOULD HAVE MADE MORE OF REALLY JUST BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN OFF WHICH NOT MANY STRIKERS IN THIS LEAGUE CAN MATCH. HE WAS ALSO PLAYING WELL AGAINST WOLVES THE FACT THIS WAS NOT APPARENT IN THE TEAM PERFORMANCE HAD MORE TO DO WITH THE FAILINGS OF THOSE AROUND HIM THAN HIS OWN SHORTCOMINGS. AS FOR AMEOBI, HE FINDS HIMSELF IN A STRANGE POSITION IN THAT WHILE HE IS MAKING A BIG IMPACT FROM THE BENCH, THE FACT THAT HE IS DOING SO AGAINST DEFENCES WHICH HAVE BEEN WORN DOWN TO SOME EXTENT AT LEAST BY THE PHYSICAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY MARKING JONES AND THE EFFECTS OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH MASONS MOVEMENT MEANS IT MUST BE VERY TEMPTING FOR RUSSELL SLADE TO LEAVE THINGS AS THEY ARE AND KEEP ON USING HIM AS AN IMPACT SUB. EVEN THOUGH HE HAD CAUSE TO BE KNACKERED AFTER HIS FIFTY YARD RUN WHICH SAW HIM TAKE ON THREE OR FOUR OPPONENTS AND CAME OUT ON TOP IN WHAT WAS A TEST OF HIS SPEED AND STRENGTH, THE WAY AMEOBI SLOWLY WALKED BACK INTO POSITION WHILE BLOWING VERY HEAVILY PERHAPS SUGGESTS THAT HE IS STILL NOT AT PEAK FITNESS? HOWEVER, ITS GOING TO BECOME HARDER AND HARDER FOR OUR MANAGER TO JUSTIFY NOT STARTING WITH AMEOBI IF HE CONTINUES TO HAVE THE IMPACT OFF THE BENCH THAT WE SAW AGAINST WOLVES AND HUDDERSFIELD. ITS JUST THAT WITH THIS MANAGERS DEVOTION TO THE 4-4-2 CAUSE, I DONT SEE IT BEING AT JONES OR MASONS EXPENSE UNLESS THEY GET INJURED I BELIEVE ITS MORE LIKELY THAT HE WILL GET THAT STARING PLACE ON THE WING IF IT COMES. WHILE THERE WAS NO DENYING AMEOBIS BIG PART IN THE FIRST GOAL (FINISHED IN THE SORT OF MANNER WHICH SUGGESTS THAT ANTHONY PILKINGTON SHOULD HAVE SCORED MORE GOALS FOR US IN WHAT, TO BE FAIR, HAS BEEN AN INJURY HIT FIRST YEAR AT THE CLUB) AND THE PART HE PLAYED IN THE SECOND ONE, I THINK THE RAISING OF OUR GAME IN THE MINUTES LEADING UP TO THE OPENING GOAL HAD AN AWFUL LOT TO DO WITH PETER WHITTINGHAM REMINDING PEOPLE LIKE ME, WHO HAVE TENDED TO QUESTION HIS PLACE IN THE TEAM IN THE LAST SEASON OR TWO, WHAT HE IS STILL CAPABLE OF GIVING US. WHITTINGHAMS SHOT FROM TWENTY FIVE YARDS BEAT STEER, BUT ALSO FLASHED JUST THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST AS WE ENTERED THE PHASE WHICH DECIDED THE GAME. FOLLOWING THIS, HE THEN REVERTED TO HIS QUARTERBACK ROLE ASHE FIRST FOUND MASON TO SEND THE STRIKER ON A RUN WHICH ENDED WITH A SHOT WHICH STEER HELD EASILY AND THEN FREED AMEOBI WITH A LOVELY BALL WHICH SPLIT THE VISITORS OFFSIDE TRAP IN THE MOVE WHICH ENDED WITH PILKINGTON SCORING. THAT FIVE MINUTES FROM WHITTINGHAM WAS A THROWBACK TO THE EARLY DAYS OF OUR CHAMPIONSHIP WINNING SEASON WHEN HE WAS A LEADING FACTOR IN A SERIES OF ENTERTAINING HOME WINS (WOLVES, BLACKPOOL, BURNLEY AND HULL SPRING TO MIND) WHICH HAVE TENDED TO BE FORGOTTEN ABOUT NOW IN MANY PEOPLES RUSH TO LABEL THE 12/13 SIDE AS BORING. YES, MUCH OF THE STUFF THE TITLE WINNERS PRODUCED FROM ABOUT NOVEMBER ONWARDS WAS FAR MORE ROUNDHEAD THAN CAVALIER, BUT THE MESSAGE HAD BEEN SENT OUT EARLY ON THAT CITY HAD THE CAPABILITY OF PUTTING OPPONENTS TO THE SWORD WHEN THEY WANTED TO (IT SHOULDNT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THEY DID THIS IN LATE SEASON HOME WINS OVER BLACKBURN AND FOREST EITHER). AT THE MOMENT, I SEE SOME COMPARISONS WITH OUR CHAMPIONSHIP WINNING TEAM IN THE WAY WE HAVE GROUND OUT A COUPLE OF HOME WINS, BUT I DONT BELIEVE AMEOBI ALONE IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE US WITH THAT LITTLE BIT EXTRA WHICH GIVES A TEAM MORE THAN JUST THE OPTION OF WINNING UGLY. SO MANY CHAMPIONSHIP MATCHES ARE A REAL SLOG AND SO THE TEAMS WHO MASTER THE KNACK OF WINNING UGLY ARE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE. HOWEVER, TO GET TO THE PREMIER LEAGUE, I THINK YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SOMETIMES SHOW THAT BIT OF QUALITY WHICH YOUR OPPONENTS CANNOT COPE WITH THAT SOMETHING WHICH GOES BEYOND JUST WINNING UGLY AND, BASED ON WHAT IVE SEEN OF THIS GROUP OF PLAYERS DURING THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS OR SO WHEN RESULTS HAVE BEEN LARGELY GOOD, IVE NOT BEEN CONVINCED THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT ON A CONSISTENT ENOUGH BASIS. CERTAINLY, IT WILL HELP A LOT IF WHITTINGHAM CAN HAVE A FEW MORE OF THOSE SPELLS WHEN HE ROLLS BACK THE YEARS LIKE HE DID YESTERDAY AND IF JONES CAN APPLY THE CONSIDERABLE TALENTS HE HAS BY THE STANDARDS OF THIS LEAGUE ON A MORE CONSISTENT BASIS. HOWEVER, I REMAIN TO BE CONVINCED THAT THIS SQUAD HAS ENOUGH STARDUST IN IT TO JUSTIFY SOME OF THE CLAIMS BEING MADE ON ITS BEHALF THAT I HEARD ON RADIO WALES PHONE IN PROGRAMME LAST NIGHT ABOUT TOP SIX FINISHES. THATS PROBABLY WHY THIS PIECE HAS ENDED UP BEING MORE NEGATIVE THAN I INTENDED IT TO BE. OF COURSE IM PLEASED TO SEE US WHERE WE ARE IN THE TABLE WHILE STILL BEING UNBEATEN, BUT IM NOT GETTING THAT FEELING WHICH HAS ME LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT MATCH AS SOON AS THE LAST ONE ENDS AT THE MOMENT. WATCHING US PLAY AT HOME ESPECIALLY IS STILL HEAVY GOING AND IT IS AT HOME, NOT AWAY. THAT TEAMS SEIZE THE IMAGINATION OF THEIR SUPPORTERS. THE CLUB WILL BE CONCERNED TO SEE ATTENDANCES STILL HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION DESPITE OUR GOOD START THERE ARE PLENTY OF REASONS FOR THIS, BUT A HOME GAME WHICH REALLY SEIZED THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION (THE DRAW WITH MAN UNITED NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO IS THE LAST TIME I CAN REMEMBER THIS HAPPENING) MIGHT IMPROVE MATTERS A BIT*. IN ADDED TIME YESTERDAY WE HAD A FREE KICK BY THE CORNER FLAG FROM WHICH AMEOBI WAS ABLE TO WORK HIMSELF INTO A DANGEROUS POSITION ON THE BYE LINE, BUT HE THEN HAD NO OPTION THAN TO BLAST THE BALL ACROSS GOAL, PRESUMABLY IN THE HOPE THAT IT WOULD HIT A HUDDERSFIELD PLAYER AND REBOUND INTO THE NET, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE WITHIN TWENTY YARDS OF THE GOAL IN A BLUE SHIRT FOR HIM TO PICK OUT THEY WERE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE DEFENDING OUR OWN GOAL. NOW, I CAN FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY ANY SIDE WOULD DO THAT WHEN THEY WERE DEFENDING A ONE GOAL LEAD, BUT A TWO GOAL ONE? WHY COULDNT WE GO FOR THE JUGULAR AND TRY TO PROVIDE A BIT MORE ENTERTAINMENT FOR SUPPORTERS WHO HAVE HAD PRECIOUS LITTLE OF THAT COMMODITY IN RECENT YEARS? IT ALL SEEMED SO TYPICALLY RUSSELL SLADE TO ME. ACTUALLY, THATS NOT FAIR ON OUR MANAGER, BECAUSE WEVE BEEN THAT SORT OF SIDE FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER, BUT I CANT HELP THINKING THAT THE CLUB (WHO, TO BE FAIR, ARE TRYING TO RECONNECT WITH THEIR SUPPORT) AS A WHOLE COULD BENEFIT ON SO MANY LEVELS FROM A MORE POSITIVE ON FIELD ATTITUDE IN MATTERS LIKE THIS WE ALWAYS LOOK LIKE A TEAM THAT IS DOING JUST ENOUGH TO WIN OUR HOME GAMES. I SAY THAT KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THERE WERE TIMES NOT SO LONG AGO WHEN I WOULD GLADLY HAVE ACCEPTED ANY HOME WIN NO MATTER HOW IT ARRIVED AND THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN TIMES A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN 20,000 PLUS WERE GOING TO BE THERE NEXT GAME NO MATTER HOW POORLY WE PLAYED, BUT THOSE DAYS HAVE GONE NOW. DESPITE RESULTS GETTING BETTER, GATES ARE STILL GOING DOWN (EACH HOME LEAGUE GAME SO FAR HAS SEEN A DECLINE OF AROUND A THOUSAND IN THE ATTENDANCE FIGURE), SO IM NOT SURE THAT WINS ALONE WILL BE ENOUGH TO SEE ATTENDANCES CLIMB TO THE SORT OF LEVELS WEVE GOT USED TO AT CARDIFF CITY STADIUM - TO BE MORE ACCURATE, IM NOT CONVINCED THAT JUST DOING ENOUGH WINS ARE GOING TO DO THE TRICK. *PICTURES COURTESY OF HTTPS://WWW.FLICKR.COM/PHOTOS/JONCANDY/ALBUMS/WITH/72157658111560859

795	DAN LILKER SAYS THERE ARE NO PLANS FOR S.O.D. TO REUNITE FOR 30TH ANNIVERSARY SEPTEMBER 22, 2015 0 COMMENTS JO SCHFTAN OF HORNS UP ROCKS! RECENTLY CONDUCTED AN INTERVIEW WITH BASSIST DAN LILKER (NUCLEAR ASSAULT, BRUTAL TRUTH, ANTHRAX, STROMTROOPERS OF DEATH). YOU CAN NOW WATCH THE CHAT BELOW. ASKED ABOUT STROMTROOPERS OF DEATH FRONTMAN BILLY MILANO'S RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE BAND WOULD REUNITE IN 2016 TO CELEBRATE THIS YEAR'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GROUP'S CLASSIC DEBUT ALBUM, "SPEAK ENGLISH OR DIE", LILKER SAID: "I KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE A REISSUE, BUT HIM TALKING ABOUT A LIVE SHOW IS ALL A LITTLE PREMATURE, LET'S SAY. IT'S GONNA BE THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF 'SPEAK ENGLISH OR DIE', SO THERE'S GONNA BE YET ANOTHER REISSUE. I SAY IT WITH A SLIGHT AIR OF CYNICISM. AND, YEAH, IT'LL BE COOL." HE CONTINUED: "BILLY MIGHT HAVE MADE IT SEEM LIKE [A REUNION SHOW WAS CONFIRMED], BUT HE DIDN'T CONSULT ANYBODY ELSE THAT PLAYED IN S.O.D. HE JUST KIND OF ANNOUNCED SOMETHING, AND WE WENT, 'HUH?' THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED." ASKED IF HE WOULD DO THE S.O.D. REUNION SHOW IF EVERYONE ELSE AGREED TO IT, LILKER SAID: "YEAH. I DON'T HAVE ANY DIFFERENCES WITH ANYBODY. IT WAS NEVER ME. I WOULD DO IT AS LONG AS I DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PREVIOUS PLANS ON THAT DAY. IF ANYTHING ELSE I HAVE ALREADY CONFIRMED IS CONFIRMED, I WOULDN'T DO IT, BUT IF THEY SAY, 'HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING JULY BLAH BLAH BLAH THIS YEAR,' I'D GO, 'OKAY. FINE.'" IN OCTOBER 2011, ANTHRAX AND STROMTROOPERS OF DEATH GUITARIST SCOTT IAN WAS ASKED BY UNRATD MAGAZINE IF THERE WAS ANY CHANCE OF ANOTHER S.O.D. REUNION, TO WHICH HE REPLIED: "NO. I THINK I CAN SAFELY SAY THAT, YEAH. IT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN IT WAS. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, WE DID TOO MUCH WITH IT. IT STARTED OUT AS A COMIC BOOK STRIP THAT I DREW IN THE STUDIO AND THEN TURNED INTO THIS RECORD THAT WE MADE, BUT YOU KNOW, THAT'S ALL THAT IT IS FOR ME. IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF THE DAMNED THINGS [A SUPERGROUP FEATURING IAN ALONGSIDE FALL OUT BOY AND EVERY TIME I DIE MEMBERS]. FOR ME, IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A REAL BAND WITH A SCHEDULE AND MAKING RECORDS AND TOURING. S.O.D. WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 'ANTI' OF THAT, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO JUST BE ABOUT HAVING FUN AND NEVER HAVING IT TURN INTO SOMETHING REAL WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S NOT JUST FUN ANYMORE IT BECOMES A JOB, IT BECOMES A BUSINESS. AND I'M GLAD EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD GOT TO SEE IT AT LEAST ONCE BECAUSE IN '99 AND 2000 WE PLAYED EVERYWHERE AND I DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO GO OUT AND DO THAT AGAIN."

796	A FORMER UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC. DRIVER WHO WON A RULING BY CALIFORNIAS LABOR COMMISSIONER THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AN EMPLOYEE OF THE APP-BASED RIDE SERVICE DEFEATED A BID BY THE COMPANY TO FORCE HER INTO ARBITRATION. A SAN FRANCISCO STATE JUDGE SIDED WITH THE DRIVER MONDAY WITH A FINDING THE COMPANYS ARBITRATION CLAUSE UNENFORCEABLE, ECHOING A FEDERAL JUDGE IN THE SAME CITY WHO HAS BLOCKED UBERS BID TO DERAIL A GROUP LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF THOUSANDS OF DRIVERS AND FORCE THEM TO FIGHT THE COMPANY INDIVIDUALLY IN ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS. UBER IS APPEALING IN THE FEDERAL CASE TO AVOID FACING A CLASS-ACTION TRIAL THAT COULD FORCE THE STARTUP TO CHANGE ITS BUSINESS MODEL AND MIGHT ERODE ITS $50 BILLION VALUATION. SAN FRANCISCO SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE ERNEST GOLDSMITH SAID UBERS CONTRACT WITH DRIVERS IS FLATLY INCONSISTENT BECAUSE IT SAYS IN ONE PROVISION THAT A PRIVATE ARBITRATOR DECIDES WHETHER A DISPUTE SHOULD BE RESOLVED IN ARBITRATION, AND SAYS IN ANOTHER THAT THE CHOICE IS TO MADE BY A JUDGE. "IM NOT GOING TO FLY IN THE FACE OF A STARK INCONSISTENCY IN ORDER TO MASSAGE THIS INTO ARBITRABILITY," THE JUDGE TOLD LAWYERS DURING A HEARING MONDAY. GOLDSMITH ISSUED A TENTATIVE RULING BEFORE THE HEARING, THEN MADE IT OFFICIAL IN COURT. UBER SAID BARBARA BERWICK AGREED TO THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BEFORE USING THE COMPANY APP STARTING IN JULY 2014. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WHEN SHE LATER COMPLAINED TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONERS OFFICE THAT SHE WAS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED AS AN EMPLOYEE, SAN FRANCISCO-BASED UBER ARGUED THAT SHE WAS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND NOT ENTITLED TO RECOVER CLAIMED WAGES OR EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT. A HEARING OFFICER IN THE COMMISSIONERS OFFICE DISAGREED. THE COMMISSIONER SAID THE COMPANY DICTATES STANDARDS SUCH AS HOW OLD A DRIVERS CAR CAN BE AND WHO IS QUALIFIED TO OFFER SERVICES THROUGH THE UBER PLATFORM. UBER APPEALED THE COMMISSIONERS FINDING IN STATE COURT IN JUNE. UBER THEN ARGUED BERWICKS DISPUTE BELONGS IN ARBITRATION. A LAWYER FOR UBER TOLD THE JUDGE MONDAY THE COMPANY WILL APPEAL TO TRY TO COMPEL BERWICK TO SUBMIT TO ARBITRATION. FEDERAL JUDGES IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVE REFUSED TO THROW OUT DRIVER LAWSUITS RAISING SIMILAR CLAIMS AGAINST UBER AND ITS RIVAL LYFT INC., SAYING THE MATTER IS BEST LEFT TO A JURY TO DECIDE.

797	1:24 P.M. CDT BY EMILY FLITTER NEW YORK (REUTERS) - REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNER DONALD TRUMP ON THURSDAY BOWED TO PRESSURE FROM THE PARTY ESTABLISHMENT AND SIGNED A PLEDGE NOT TO RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE IN THE NOVEMBER 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. HIS VOW OF LOYALTY ON THURSDAY WAS SOMETHING OF A VICTORY FOR THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE IN ITS EFFORTS TO REIN IN THE BILLIONAIRE, WHO LEADS OPINION POLLS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME UPSETTING MAINSTREAM REPUBLICANS WITH HIS BRASH STYLE. BUT THE PLEDGE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE LEGALLY BINDING AND DOES NOTHING TO HALT TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTACKS AGAINST REPUBLICAN RIVALS AND STINGING RHETORIC ON ISSUES LIKE IMMIGRATION THAT HAVE SHAKEN UP THE RACE FOR THE NOMINATION. AT A NEWS CONFERENCE IN HIS OWN TRUMP TOWER IN MANHATTAN, THE PROPERTY MAGNATE WAVED THE LOYALTY PLEDGE, SIGNED IN A THICK BLACK MARKER, IN THE AIR FOR TV CAMERAS. "I SEE NO CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH I WOULD TEAR UP THAT PLEDGE," HE SAID. TRUMP HAD PREVIOUSLY REFUSED TO RULE OUT A THIRD-PARTY BID, DRAWING BOOS FROM THE CROWD IN OHIO LAST MONTH AT THE FIRST FULL REPUBLICAN DEBATE. AN INDEPENDENT TRUMP CANDIDACY COULD SPLIT SUPPORT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND GIVE THE DEMOCRATS A HUGE BOOST BY TAKING MANY BLUE-COLLAR MALE REPUBLICAN VOTERS WITH HIM. HE SAID ON THURSDAY HE RECEIVED "ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OTHER THAN THE ASSURANCE THAT I WOULD BE TREATED FAIRLY" IN RETURN FOR SIGNING THE PLEDGE. THE REALITY TV STAR HAD COME UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE IN RECENT WEEKS FROM THE RNC AND ITS CHAIRMAN, REINCE PRIEBUS, WHO MET WITH HIM ON THURSDAY. "IT REFLECTS A LOT OF BEHIND THE SCENES WORK," AN RNC OFFICIAL SAID. BUSH GOADING TRUMP MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN REACTING TO GOADING FROM RIVAL JEB BUSH WHO THIS WEEK RELEASED A VIDEO ACCUSING HIM OF BEING A DEMOCRAT IN DISGUISE AND HOLDING LIBERAL POSITIONS ON ABORTION RIGHTS, TAX AND HEALTHCARE. "I DONT KNOW WHAT MOTIVATED (TRUMP) SPECIFICALLY, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT ITS A NON-BINDING DEAL," SAID DAVE CARNEY, AN UNALIGNED REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. HE SAID THE PLEDGE HAD SOME MEANING DURING THE PRIMARY PROCESS WHICH IS RUN BY STATE PARTIES BUT NOT DURING THE GENERAL ELECTION WHICH IS ORGANIZED BY STATE GOVERNMENTS. ALMOST TWO MONTHS AFTER REACHING THE TOP OF OPINION POLLS AMONG REPUBLICANS, TRUMP HAS COME UNDER SUSTAINED FIRE FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM BUSH, THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA. REUTERS/IPSOS POLLING SHOWS TRUMP WITH SUPPORT AMONG NEARLY 31 PERCENT OF SELF-IDENTIFIED REPUBLICANS AS OF SEPT. 1, WITH BUSH AT NEARLY 12 PERCENT, BEHIND FORMER NEUROSURGEON BEN CARSON. HTTP://BIT.LY/1HWTSGH TRUMP FIRED A SALVO BACK ON THURSDAY IN A FIGHT WITH BUSH OVER IMMIGRANTS AND THE ROLE OF ENGLISH. "I THINK THAT WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT, WE'RE A NATION THAT SPEAKS ENGLISH AND I THINK WHILE WE ARE IN THIS NATION WE SHOULD BE SPEAKING ENGLISH," HE SAID. "WHETHER PEOPLE LIKE IT OR NOT, THAT'S HOW WE ASSIMILATE." IN TURN, BUSH MADE FUN OF TRUMP'S PLEDGE BY TWEETING A PHOTOGRAPH OF A PIECE OF PAPER WITH THE WORDS "VOTED REPUBLICAN SINCE 1972," ON IT AND SIGNED BY BUSH. POLITICAL PARTIES AT THE STATE LEVEL OFTEN ASK CANDIDATES TO SIGN LOYALTY PLEDGES, BUT IT IS UNPRECEDENTED FOR REPUBLICANS IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. ANOTHER OF THE 17 REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, SAID THE TRUMP PLEDGE WAS "JUST A LITTLE TOO MUCH DRAMA."

798	IANS WASHINGTON INDIA HAS INVITED US COMPANIES TO INVEST IN THE INDIAN ENERGY SECTOR AS INDIA-US COLLABORATION OFFERED GREAT POTENTIAL, IN VIEW OF INDIAS ENORMOUS ENERGY NEEDS AND THE US RESOURCES, CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGY. THE INVITATION WAS EXTENDED BY MINISTER OF STATE FOR POWER PIYUSH GOYAL AT THE INDIA-US MINISTERIAL ENERGY DIALOGUE CO-CHAIRED BY HIM AND THE US ENERGY SECRETARY ERNEST MONIZ HERE MONDAY. HE ALSO INVITED US FIRMS TO PARTICIPATE IN INDIAS UNCONVENTIONAL HYDROCARBONS SECTOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION OF ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES SUCH AS SHALE OIL, SHALE GAS AND GAS HYDRATES. DURING THE DIALOGUE, THE TWO SIDES REVIEWED THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE SIX WORKING GROUPS OF THE ENERGY DIALOGUE AND IDENTIFIED NEW AREAS FOR COOPERATION, ACCORDING TO AN INDIAN EMBASSY MEDIA RELEASE. THEY ALSO REVIEWED VARIOUS ENERGY RELATED ISSUES AGREED IN THE INDIA-US JOINT STATEMENT DURING PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMAS VISIT TO INDIA IN JANUARY. GOYAL STRESSED THE INDIAN GOVERNMENTS GOAL OF PROVIDING 247 POWER ACROSS INDIA BY 2019 BY CREATING COST EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WAS SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE OF CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS. STRESSING INDIAS COMMITMENT TO PURSUE A GREEN PATH TO GROWTH, HE SPOKE OF INDIAS AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR DEPLOYMENT OF 175 GW RENEWABLE POWER CAPACITIES BY 2022. THESE WOULD INCLUDE 100 GW OF SOLAR AND 60 GW OF WIND, WHICH MAY REQUIRE INVESTMENT OF AROUND $150 BILLION IN THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. GOYAL ALSO EXPOUNDED ON THE GOVERNMENTS OBJECTIVE OF CONSTRUCTION OF 100 SMART CITIES WHICH WOULD INCLUDE IN ITS BLUEPRINT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS FOR POWER GENERATION, USAGE OF RENEWABLE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY TECHNOLOGIES AND COMPREHENSIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME. DURING THE DIALOGUE, PRESENTATIONS WERE MADE ON PROGRESS MADE UNDER VARIOUS JOINT RESEARCH PROGRAMMES. IT WAS AGREED TO EXPLORE ADDITION OF SMART GRIDS AND ENERGY STORAGE FOR GRID APPLICATION AS THE FOURTH STREAM UNDER PARTNERSHIP TO ADVANCE CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH (PACE R) THE NEED TO DEVELOP A ROBUST ENERGY DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO DEVELOP BETTER SIMULATION OF THE ENERGY SCENARIO IN INDIA IN THE FUTURE WAS ALSO RECOGNISED. THE WORKING GROUP ON COAL IDENTIFIED SOME AREAS OF COAL MINING WHERE BOTH COUNTRIES COULD COLLABORATE. IT WAS RECOGNISED THAT INDIA HAD PROVEN RESERVES OF SHALE GAS AND US HAD WELL DEVELOPED EXPERTISE FOR SHALE GAS EXTRACTION. COLLABORATION IN THE AREA OF FRACKING OF SHALE GAS, ESPECIALLY WATER LESS FRACKING IN INDIA WERE IDENTIFIED AS AREAS OF FUTURE COOPERATION UNDER THE ENERGY DIALOGUE. DISCUSSIONS WERE ALSO HELD IN THE WORKING GROUPS ON FINANCING OF CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS ON INNOVATIVE FINANCING FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY MICROFINANCE AND MICRO ENTERPRISES. IT WAS RECOGNISED THAT COAL BASED POWER PLANTS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE MAINSTAY OF INDIAS ELECTRICITY GENERATION SOURCE IN THE C OMING DECADES. HOWEVER, THE INDIAN DELEGATION URGED THE US TO SHARE TECHNOLOGY RELATED TO SUPERCRITICAL COAL PLANTS AS WELL AS SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND TOOLS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND CARBON FOOTPRINT OF EXISTING POWER PLANTS.
799	UPDATE: LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY & THECURE IS CURIOSITY. HOW SEEKING CHANGE HAS BROUGHT ME EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEENLOOKING FOR. IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING MY JOURNEY, CHECK OUT THE PREVIOUS PIECES OF THE STORY HERE: WK1 , WK2 , WK3 , WK4 WEVE ALL HEARD THE SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, DOES IT MAKE A SOUND? THIS QUESTION DRAWSON MANY NOTIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE SELF, AND THAT IF ONE DOES NOT EXPERIENCE SOMETHING, THAN THE QUESTION IS DID ITREALLY HAPPEN? BUT LETS GO BACK AND THINK INSTEAD OF THIS SCENARIO: IF LIGHTING STRIKES IN THE WOODS AND STARTS A FIRE, BUT NO ONE IS AROUND TO SEE IT, WILL IT STILL BURN A PART OF THE FOREST DOWN? THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS YES. OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY DOES NOT DICTATE WHAT IS REAL, BUT MERELY WHAT WE ARE PERCEIVING AS AN ACTIVE PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE EXIST. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES, HOW DO WE INCLUDE THIS LIGHTNING STRIKE IN OUR LIVES SO THAT WE CAN BE AN ACTIVE FORCE IN STOPPING THE FOREST FIRE? THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. SINCE WE CANT CHANGE WHERE THE LIGHTNING STRIKES, WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE OUT LOOKING FOR IT. IN SHORT, IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD, WE HAVE TO BE AN ACTIVE PIECE IN IT. OUR BODIES ARE TEMPLES FOR OUR MINDS FLESHY PRISONS WITH WHICH WE TRAVERSE THIS LIFE IN ORDER TO SEEK BALANCE AND PEACE AND FREEDOM. HOWEVER, IN THIS BELIEF, OUR BODIES ARE STILL PLAYERS IN THE GAME OF LIFE; THEY ARE THETEMPLE WITHIN WHICH OUR MINDS RESIDE, SO SHOULDNT WE BE TREATING OUR TEMPLES LIKE TEMPLES?! AND BY THIS, I MEAN TO PUSH OUR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND STAMINA TO THEIR LIMITS AND TO SEEK CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT ON THIS PHYSICAL FORM IN WHICH EXIST. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUS AAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. LETS PLAY THE WHAT IF GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS: WHAT IF YOU ARE WALKING TO YOUR CAR AND THREE PEOPLE GET THE DROP ON YOU; COULD YOU DEFEND YOURSELF? WHAT IF YOUR HOME CATCHES ON FIRE AND THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THE SECOND STORY WINDOW; DO YOU KNOW HOW TO JUMP AND LAND SAFELY? WHAT IF YOUR SON WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM? WHAT IF YOU WORKED A FEW MINUTES FROM HOME AND YOUR WIFE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND NEEDED YOU HOME IMMEDIATELY,BUT YOUR CAR WAS DEAD IN THE PARKING LOT, COULD YOU RUN ALL THE WAY HOME? CAN YOU PROTECT THE ONES YOU LOVE? COULD YOU OUTRUN SOMETHING HUNTING YOU DOWN? CAN YOU SURVIVE ON YOUR OWN WHEN TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE WITHIN REACH TO HELP YOU? I SPENT THE WEEK PRACTICING HUAQUAN AND RUNNING. MY BEST FRIEND, ALSO AN ADVENTURE ENTHUSIAST, AND I SPENT THE WEEKENDCLIMBING THROUGH AERIAL OBSTACLE COURSES IN THE TREES OF THE BERKSHIRES IN MASSACHUSETTS.AFTER THE LONG WEEKEND, I BEGAN THE WEEK LIKE I ALWAYS DO, EXHAUSTED; BUT I COULD FEEL THE HAPPINESS IN EACH SORE MUSCLE FIBER. THE ELONGATED SIGH AS ONE SETTLES IN TO THE COUCH AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, OR INTO A HOT TUB ON THE FIRST DAY OF VACATION, THAT IS WHAT EACH OF MY MUSCLES FEELS. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUSAAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. SO WHAT HAS THIS SHOWN ME? WELL FIRST, LETS RECAP THE RECENT FOUR WEEKS CHALLENGES: I HAVE BEGUN TO REFINE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SINCE I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY. MY GIRLFRIEND STARTED A NEW JOB AS A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHICH REQUIRES HER TO BE WAKING UP AT 3:30AM MOST MORNINGS (LAST NIGHT WE AWOKE AT 1:45AM). I HAVE BEGUN TO WAKE UP WITH HER, AS OPPOSED TO 6AM, AND ENSURE THAT HER BREAKFAST/ LUNCH ARE READY FOR THE DAY. I DONT WORK OUT FOR TWO HOURS, BUT FOR A HALF AN HOUR: A WARM UP ROUTINE CONSISTING OF PUSH UPS, SIT UPS, LEG RAISES, AND TRICEP DIPS. I SPEND THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING IMMERSED IN THE ONLINE WORLD CHECKING EMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS, NETWORKING, WORKING ON WRITING/ EDITING, OR SOME MORNINGS JUST GAMING. AS MY LIFE EVOLVES, SO MUST I. THOSE THAT ARE AFRAID OF CHANGE GET LEFT IN THE DUST. MILAN KUNDERA, CZECH BORN EXISTENTIAL WRITER, POSED THAT: ANYONE WHOSE GOAL IS SOMETHING HIGHER MUST EXPECT SOMEDAY TO SUFFER VERTIGO. WHAT IS VERTIGO? FEAR OF FALLING? NO, VERTIGO IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN FEAR OF FALLING. IT IS THE VOICE OF THE EMPTINESS BELOW US WHICH TEMPTS AND LURES US, IT IS THE DESIRE TO FALL, AGAINST WHICH, TERRIFIED, WE DEFEND OURSELVES. I TIME LAST WEEK WORKING ON EXACTLY WHAT I SET OUT TO DO. I DREW UP A BUSINESS PLAN FOR LAUNCHING MY OWN COMPANY.OVER THE COURSE THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE RESEARCHED SIMILAR PEOPLE TO MYSELF AND THEIR VENTURES. THE VERDICT IS IN: STARTING OUT ON YOUR OWN IS DIFFICULT; IN WAYS THAT I COULD SIT HERE AND DESCRIBE TO YOU, BUT I DONT WANT YOU TO BE AFRAID OF EVER DOING IT.IT REQUIRES PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE AND A LOT OF HARD WORK. AS ANAIS NIN WROTE, LIFE SHRINKS OR EXPANDS IN PROPORTION TO ONES COURAGE. IF YOU DESIRE STRONGLY ENOUGH AND POSSESS THE PROPER COURAGE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. I PRESENTED MYBUSINESS PLAN TO MY BEST FRIEND OVER COFFEE.  BECAUSE I DONT KNOW ANY OF THOSE MATTERS EXCEPT FOR WHAT THE POLICE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE DISCLOSED. WE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF MY PLAN. IT WILL REQUIRE HUGE EFFORT AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR FREE TIME. HOWEVER, AFTER MUCH DELIBERATING, WE HAVE DECIDED TO PURSUE THIS AVENUE AS A MEANS TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE.IT WILL STILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE BUILD UP A PLATFORM FROM WHICH WE CAN LAUNCH. FOR NOW, THIS MEANSTHAT THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS OF MY JOURNEY HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS IM WELL ON THE WAY TO LOVING MY LIFE AND FINDING MORE AND MORE WAYS TO BATTLE MY DEPRESSION WHEN IT REARS ITS UGLY HEAD! HOWEVER, IM NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS METAPHOR, THATS A GOOD THING. THE ONLY WAY IN LIFE WE COULD EVER HEAR THAT TREE FALL, OR STOP THAT FOREST FIRE, IS TO BE PRESENT; AND THAT MEANS PUTTING YOURSELF INTO SITUATIONS THAT YOU WOULDNT NORMALLY BE IN. THOUGH WHAT IS NORMAL? THE TREND OF A THING TO REMAIN AT A CONSTANT ACCEPTED BY A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN PLACE. BECAUSE NORMAL FOR YOU MAY NOT BE NORMAL FOR ME. BECAUSE NORMAL ALL OVER THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT. SO GO LEARN ABOUT OTHER NORMALS. LIVE. JOURNEY. ADVENTURE. ALL OF LIFE IS ADVENTURE. BUT DYLLON, I DONT HAVE THE TIME TO BE ADVENTURING, OR STARTING NEW THINGS IM AN INDOORS GUY, GOING OUT AND ADVENTURING JUST ISNT FOR ME I LIVE IN A CITY, WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND A TREE IN A CITY IN 2015? THESE ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS.  TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER ANY TIME PERIOD IN YOUR LIFE. OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE REMEMBERING THE TIME PERIOD BASED ON THE EVENTS. YOU DONT REMEMBER EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR DAYS BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE WASNT EXCITING; EVERY MINUTE DIDNT LEAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION ON YOU. WHAT STANDS OUT IN LIFE WHAT REALLY GIVES YOU ENERGY AND MAKES YOU GO IS THE UNUSUAL, THE CHANGE, & THE AWESOME. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. WALKING TO THE BATHROOM ON YOUR HANDS. BUILDING A FORT WITH YOUR KIDS. COOKING A FOREIGN DISH FOR AROUND THE WORLD NIGHT FOR YOUR WIFE. SEEING A TREND? REMEMBER: CHALLENGING YOURSELF WILL ONLY PRODUCE POSITIVE EFFECTS. NEW EXPERIENCES CAN ONLY CAUSE US TO GROW. THUSLY, MY CHALLENGE FOR THIS UPCOMING WEEK WILL BE TO ADVENTURE AT LEAST ONCE A DAY, AND DO SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING AT LEAST ONCEEACH WEEK. LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY, AND THE CURE IS CURIOSITY. CURIOSITY IS THE FUEL OF THE SOUL. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU ARE NOT SURE WHERE TO START, WRITE OR TWEET TO ME! AND COME BACK FOR NEXT WEEKS ARTICLE!

801	THE GRANDSON OF A WOMAN WHO LOST HER LEG IN A GANG BRAWL IN MASTERTON HAS BEEN SENTENCED FOR TWO RELATED ASSAULTS IN A FEUD WHICH, ACCORDING TO HIS LAWYER, IS NOW OVER. D-JAE RHODES, 18, WAS SENTENCED IN MASTERTON DISTRICT COURT ON THURSDAY FOR AN ASSAULT ON MARCH 29 - THE NIGHT OF THE FIGHT - AND AN ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO INJURE THAT FOLLOWED A COURT APPEARANCE A MONTH LATER. HE WAS SENTENCED TO SIX MONTHS COMMUNITY DETENTION, 80 HOURS COMMUNITY WORK AND NINE MONTHS SUPERVISION. JUDGE BILL HASTINGS SAID ON MARCH 29 RHODES, WHO WAS 17 AT THE TIME, HAD ARRIVED WITH AN ASSOCIATE AT A MASTERTON ADDRESS, "FOR WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS A TWO-ON-TWO FIGHT TO SETTLE SOME SIMMERING TENSIONS". "YOU ARRIVED ONLY TO FIND MONGREL MOB MEMBERS EMERGE CARRYING WEAPONS". RHODES HAD ESCAPED BUT WAS FOLLOWED BY "A CAR DRIVEN AT SPEED TOWARDS YOU - DRIVEN ALLEGEDLY BY A MONGREL MOB MEMBER". "YOU JUMPED OUT OF THE WAY AND THE CAR HIT MRS (QUANITA) ROBINSON, WHO IS IN COURT TODAY," THE JUDGE SAID. MRS ROBINSON WAS IN COURT, SEATED IN A WHEELCHAIR AND ACCOMPANIED BY OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. JUDGE HASTINGS SAID RHODES HAD GIVEN CHASE AND "MISTAKENLY HIT AND KICKED THE PERSON YOU THOUGHT WAS THE DRIVER". ON APRIL 30 MANY WERE DUE TO APPEAR IN MASTERTON DISTRICT COURT IN CONNECTION WITH THE ALTERCATION, THE JUDGE SAID. "MEMBERS OF BOTH FACTIONS FACED OFF APPARENTLY ACROSS THE STREET IN THE PARKING LOT." RHODES' LAWYER, JAMES ELLIOT, SAID THE VICTIM OF RHODES ASSAULT HERE HAD BEEN THE AGGRESSOR, APPROACHING RHODES AND AN ASSOCIATE "WITH A HAMMER AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE A LARGE LUG WRENCH". MR ELLIOT SAID THE MAN WAS "VERY CLEARLY ADVANCING", BUT WAS SHOWN BY CAMERAS TO RETREAT AS POLICE APPROACHED. RHODES WAS "17 AND FULL OF ADRENALINE HAVING BEEN ATTACKED WITH A WEAPON", MR ELLIOT SAID, AND HE CLAIMED WHAT FOLLOWED WAS "EXCESSIVE SELF DEFENCE". JUDGE HASTINGS WAS NOT SURE, SAYING THAT THE WEAPONS WERE BEING HID IN A CAR AT THE TIME OF THE ASSAULT. RHODES HAD PUNCHED THE MAN IN THE FACE AND KNOCKED HIM TO THE GROUND; HE WAS KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS AND BROKE HIS HAND, AND RHODES HAD THEN KICKED HIM WHILE HE WAS ON THE GROUND. JAMES ELLIOT SAID GANGS WERE INVOLVED, BUT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THAT "AS MUCH AS CONFLICT AND TROUBLE BETWEEN TWO EXTENDED FAMILIES". MR ELLIOT SAID THERE WAS LATER A "MEETING, OR HUI IF YOU LIKE, BETWEEN SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE FAMILIES". SOME INVOLVED HAD "BEEN TELLING ME THERE HAS BEEN NO VIOLENCE SINCE THESE OCCASIONS". JUDGE BILL HASTINGS REPLIED, "THAT CAN ONLY BE A GOOD THING". - WAIRARAPA TIMES-AGE

803	FOR MOST PEOPLE, BREATHING FIRE IS JUST AN EXPRESSION. BUT FOR TORCH, IT'S A WAY OF LIFE. CHAD LAND, WHO PREFERS HIS STAGE NAME TORCH, TOURS THE COUNTRY FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR -- USUALLY FROM MARCH THROUGH OCTOBER AT VARIOUS BIKER RALLIES -- ENTERTAINING BIKERS WITH HIS FIRE PERFORMANCE.

AND CATER TO RIDERS, MOTORCYCLE, MAINLY." WHEN HE ARRIVES, EVENT STAFF CLEAR OUT A 25-FOOT RADIUS FOR HIS PERFORMING AREA, WHICH IS NEVER ON STAGE, BUT IS SOMETIMES IN FRONT OF ONE. TORCH PREFERS TO BE ON THE GROUND, WITH HIS AUDIENCE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE THE NUANCES OF HIS DANGEROUS PERFORMANCE. THE RADIUS IS TO KEEP THE AUDIENCE SAFE FROM THE BIG AND FLASHY MOVES, SUCH AS THE 8- AND 10-FOOT FLAMES SHOT FROM HIS MOTORCYCLE, THE 30- AND 40-FOOT CURLS STEMMING FROM HIS FLAMETHROWER AND TO KEEP THEM A REASONABLE DISTANCE FROM THE TALL FLAMES HE BREATHES. TORCH ALSO USES AN ARRAY OF NUNCHUCKS, A BULLWHIP AND A FIRE STAFF (THAT LOOKS LIKE A BATON) TO SPIN, CRACK AND WIELD FIRE IN CIRCLES, ARCS AND OTHER SHAPES. "WHEN YOU SAY 'FIRE SHOW,' YOU PICTURE SOMEONE DOING A VERY SLOW PACE," TORCH SAYS. "MOST [FIRE PERFORMERS] ARE WEIRD LOOKING DUDES TRYING TO LOOK SEXY [WHILE PERFORMING]. THEY HAVE THEIR SHIRT OFF AND HAVE LONG HAIR OR HAVE GIRLS IN HULA HOOPS. "A LOT OF THE FIRE PERFORMERS DO ONE THING AT A SLOW PACE AND CAN DRAG IT OUT FOR 5 OR 10 MINUTES." BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU GET WITH HIS SHOW, BECAUSE HE'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE FIRE PERFORMER. "MINE HAS LOTS OF ENERGY, WORKING THE CROWD AND GETTING LOTS OF ENERGY GOING," HE SAYS. "IT'S MORE IN-YOUR-FACE ... TO GET THE WHOLE CROWD'S ATTENTION." RATHER THAN A BIG, LONG SET, TORCH WILL DO VARIOUS ACTS, USUALLY AT 30 SECONDS TO A MINUTE EACH. ONCE SOMETHING STOPS BEING INTERESTING, HE STOPS DOING IT. HE FEEDS ON THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CROWD AND EXERTS SO MUCH ENERGY WITH EACH PERFORMANCE THAT HE USUALLY FEELS SICK AFTERWARD, FROM ALL THE EFFORT SPENT AND THE HIGH DEMAND IT PUTS ON HIS BODY. WHILE DOING A SHOW, "TO PUMP UP ENERGY, I'LL BE RUNNING AROUND LIKE A MANIAC," HE SAYS. BUT THE TECHNIQUE OF EATING FIRE TAKES DISCIPLINE, INCLUDING HIGH CONTROL OF HIS BREATHING. GOING FULL THROTTLE TO AN INSTANT STOP MEANS A LOT OF PRACTICE. TORCH GOT HIS START IN 2009 WHEN HE LEARNED HOW TO USE BASIC FIRE PERFORMING EQUIPMENT FROM A FIRE-EATING GO-GO DANCER AT A DALLAS NIGHTCLUB, WHERE HE WORKED. AFTER A FEW 10- AND 15-MINUTE TEACHING SESSIONS, HE BOUGHT HIS OWN EQUIPMENT AND PERFORMED A COUPLE TIMES A NIGHT SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK. HE STARTED TOURING IN 2012 AND ENJOYS STAYING ON THE ROAD. IT KEEPS HIM CLOSE TO NATURE, GIVES HIM A WAY TO SEE THE COUNTRY AND INTRODUCES HIM TO WHAT HE DESCRIBES AS A STELLAR GROUP OF PEOPLE. "ABOVE ALL, I'M A BIKER," HE SAYS ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE. "I LOVE MY BIKER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND WHAT WE REPRESENT, WHICH IS GREAT CAUSES." IT INFLUENCES THE VENUES HE PICKS FOR PERFORMANCE, WHICH INCLUDE PLENTY OF BIKER RALLIES. "YOU BECOME FAMILY WITH A LOT OF [PEOPLE] AT THESE RALLIES," HE SAYS. "BIKERS ARE A CLOSE KNIT GROUP OF PEOPLE. A LOT GOES INTO THESE RALLIES [INCLUDING] A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE." NAN WHAT'S UP ON 09/25/2
804	EAST TIMOR HAS LAUNCHED ANOTHER LEGAL SALVO AT AUSTRALIA IN ITS LONG-RUNNING DISPUTE OVER ACCESS TO LUCRATIVE UNDERSEA OIL-AND-GAS FIELDS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, DEMANDING ARBITRATION ON PETROLEUM EXPORT ARRANGEMENTS. EAST TIMOR'S GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT ADVISED AUSTRALIA THAT IT HAD DEMANDED ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE AN IMPASSE OVER JURISDICTION AND TAXATION RIGHTS OVER A PETROLEUM EXPORT PIPELINE INTO THE GREATER SUNRISE PETROLEUM FIELDS BETWEEN BOTH COUNTRIES. "GIVEN THE INABILITY TO DISCUSS THE DEGREES OF JURISDICTION IN THE DISPUTED WATERS, [EAST TIMOR] IS NOW OF THE VIEW THAT THE ONLY WAY TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER IS BY SUBMITTING THE DISPUTE TO AN ARBITRATION TRIBUNAL," AGIO PEREIRA, A SPOKESMAN FOR THE EAST TIMOR GOVERNMENT, SAID. AUSTRALIA'S CLAIMS TO ABSOLUTE RIGHTS RELATING TO THE LENGTH OF PETROLEUM EXPORT PIPELINE INTO THE AREA, HE SAID, WOULD DENY TIMOR-LESTE ANY JURISDICTIONAL RIGHTS RELATING TO THE PIPELINE OR ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THISPIPELINE, POTENTIALLY CLOSING DOWN MUCH-NEEDED REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES. AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY WASN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON THE RENEWED LEGAL CHALLENGE. CANBERRA AND DILI ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN A DISPUTE OVER ALLEGATIONS OF AUSTRALIAN SPYING AHEAD OF NEGOTIATIONS ON THE 2006 SEA-BORDER TREATY. EAST TIMOR ARGUES THAT THE TREATY SHOULD BE RENEGOTIATED BECAUSE AUSTRALIA HAD AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE DURING THE TALKS BECAUSE LISTENING DEVICES WERE ALLEGEDLY PLACED INSIDE THE TIMORESE CABINET OFFICE. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PACT, BOTH COUNTRIES AGREED TO CARVE UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ROYALTIES FROM THE GREATER SUNRISE FIELD, WHICH HOLDS MORE THAN 5 TRILLION CUBIC FEET OF GAS AND CONDENSATE BEING JOINTLY DEVELOPED BY PARTNERS INCLUDING AUSTRALIA'S WOODSIDE PETROLEUM, CONOCOPHILLIPS OF THE US AND ROYAL DUTCH SHELL. ALMOST 80 PER CENT OF THE AREA DESIGNATED FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE OIL-AND-GAS FIELDS LIES WITHIN AUSTRALIAN WATERS, WHILE THE REST IS IN TERRITORY JOINTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE TWO NATIONS ALONG A BOUNDARY SET IN 1972 WHEN EAST TIMOR WAS STILL OCCUPIED BY INDONESIA. THE FIELD IS 93 MILES SOUTH OF EAST TIMOR AND MORE THAN 280 MILES OFF AUSTRALIA'S NORTHERN COASTLINE. THE DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN DELAYED BY A NUMBER OF CLASHES, INCLUDING OVER EAST TIMOR'S INSISTENCE THAT GAS BE PIPED AND PROCESSED ONSHORE TO HELP CREATE EMPLOYMENT AND A PETROLEUM INDUSTRY IN THE COUNTRY, OFFICIALLY KNOWN AS THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE. THE VENTURE PARTNERS PREFER TO PROCESS THE GAS MORE CHEAPLY USING A FLOATING VESSEL AT SEA. DILI IS ALSO SEEKING TO PLACE THE MARITIME BORDER AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES-GIVING EAST TIMOR'S GOVERNMENT A GREATER SHARE OF ROYALTIES FROM A RESOURCE IT HOPES WILL HELP THE IMPOVERISHED NATION UNDERWRITE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. THE CURRENT TREATY HAS UNDERPINNED A NATIONAL SOVEREIGN WEALTH PETROLEUM FUND TOTALING $US17 BILLION, BUT IT COULD RUN OUT AS SOON AS THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT DECADE WITH THE LEGAL DISPUTE EXPECTED TO LAST YEARS. EAST TIMOR IS 90 PER CENT DEPENDENT ON OIL AND GAS REVENUE FOR ITS ECONOMY. AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER JULIE BISHOP IN JUNE TOLD PARLIAMENT THAT CANBERRA WOULDN'T RENEGOTIATE THE TREATY, ARGUING THE EXISTING MARITIME TREATY ALREADY GAVE EAST TIMOR 90 PER CENT OF THE REVENUE FROM THE JOINT-DEVELOPMENT AREA AND 50 PER CENT FROM THE GREATER SUNRISE FIELD ITSELF, MOST OF WHICH LIES IN EXCLUSIVE AUSTRALIAN TERRITORY. STEPHEN GRENVILLE, AN ANALYST AT THE LOWY INSTITUTE, AN INDEPENDENT AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN-POLICY THINK TANK, SAID CANBERRA HAD GOOD REASONS TO STAND ITS GROUND, AS THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS ALSO INVOLVED INDONESIA AND COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR AUSTRALIA'S WIDER UNDERSEA TERRITORIAL CLAIMS. "IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT SUNRISE IS CLOSER TO TIMOR THAN IT IS TO AUSTRALIA, BUT IT IS CLOSER TO INDONESIA THAN IT IS TO TIMOR," MR GRENVILLE SAID IN A BRIEFING NOTE LAST MONTH. "IF YOU WANT TO DRAW THIS BORDER WITH A VIEW TO GETTING SUNRISE INTO TIMOR'S TERRITORY, YOU WILL SURELY OPEN UP THE ISSUE OF INDONESIA'S BORDER." SHIFTING THE TREATY BOUNDARY WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GIVING TIMOR ALL OF THE POTENTIAL SUNRISE REVENUE COULD LIKELY PUT THE FIELD EVENTUALLY IN INDONESIAN TERRITORY. "IT SEEMS UNLIKELY INDONESIA WOULD BE READY TO GIVE 50 PER CENT OF SUNRISE REVENUE TO TIMOR," MR GRENVILLE SAID. "TIMOR WOULD GET NOTHING."
805	JOS MARA RUDA REIGNITED THE DISCUSSION OVER THE SO-CALLED 'CLAIM' TO THE ISLANDS IN 1965 WITH HIS IMPASSIONED (AND INACCURATE) SPEECH TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE III. THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT HAS PREVIOUSLY WORKED ALONGSIDE THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA, WITH JOINT ACCORDS ON A RANGE OF ECONOMIC ISSUES. ONE BY ONE, AND LARGELY UNDER A KIRCHNER REGIME, THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA HAS RENEGED ON THESE AGREEMENTS. IN THE DECADE OF KIRCHNERITE GOVERNMENT, ARGENTINA HAS WALKED AWAY FROM EVERY CHANCE OF DIALOGUE ON THE FALKLANDS. AMB. NAHN ACCUSES BRITAIN OF 'MILITARIZATION' OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC, BUT THE MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE ISLANDS IS A LEVEL APPROPRIATE TO DETER AGGRESSION BY ARGENTINA, AND IS PROPORTIONATE TO THE PERCEIVED THREAT. THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINE, WHILST DENYING ANY MILITARY DESIGNS ON THE ISLANDS, HAS SPENT THE PAST YEAR ATTEMPTING TO BROKER DEALS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT FROM SPAIN, SWEDEN, ISRAEL, RUSSIA AND CHINA TO BOLSTER ITS OWN FORCES, YET BITTERLY COMPLAINS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES (INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW SCHOOL) IN THE FALKLANDS. THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF ALL PEOPLES IN ENSHRINED IN THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER, AND SAFEGUARDS THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO DETERMINE ONE'S OWN POLITICAL FUTURE, AND ANY ALLEGIANCES THEREIN. WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, HAVE A RIGHT TO A SAY IN OUR OWN POLITICAL FUTURE, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS ASSURED US THAT THERE CAN BE NO DISCUSSIONS ON SOVEREIGNTY WITH ARGENTINA UNLESS WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, SO WISH. AND WE EXPRESSED OUR WISH IN OUR HISTORIC REFERENDUM IN MARCH 2013. THIS WAS INTERNATIONALLY OVERSEEN AND SAW 99.8% OF THOSE WHO VOTED FREELY CHOOSING TO RETAIN OUR CURRENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UK. AMB. NAHN CLAIMED THAT THE UK REFUSES TO ENTER NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT ISSUES OTHER THAN SOVEREIGNTY.  THE UK HAS SIMPLY SAID THAT ISLANDERS NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY DISCUSSIONS, AND WE HAVE EXTENDED NUMEROUS INVITATIONS TO TALK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA. THESE GO UNACKNOWLEDGED. IN FEBRUARY 2013 THEN- BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY HAGUE AGREED TO MEET WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF ARGENTINA IN LONDON. TIMERMAN REFUSED TO ATTEND BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE AND I, AS ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT, WERE PRESENT. THE EMPTY CHAIR AT THAT MEETING SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT THE SINCERITY OF ARGENTINA'S CALL FOR DIALOGUE. AMB. NAHN CLAIMS TO SEEK DIALOGUE WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM TO 'NEGOTIATE' OVER THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, YET THE ARGENTINE CONSTITUTION (REVISED IN 1994) PLAINLY STATES 'THE RECOVERY OF SAID TERRITORIES [FALKLAND ISLANDS, SOUTH GEORGIA & SOUTH SANDWICH ISLANDS] AND THE FULL EXERCISE OF SOVEREIGNTY [...] CONSTITUTES A PERMANENT AND UNRELINQUISHABLE GOAL OF THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE.' CONSTITUTIONALLY, THEN, ARGENTINA CANNOT, AND WILL NOT, SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN FULL CONTROL OF THE FALKLANDS, AND THEREFORE ANY THE ISLANDS ISN'T A 'NEGOTIATION' AT ALL - WHEN ARGENTINA SAYS 'DIALOGUE' IT REALLY MEANS 'DELIVER THE FALKLANDS TO US.' THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH ARGENTINA ABOUT MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST, YET IT IS ARGENTINA WHO CONSISTENTLY IGNORES OUR INVITATIONS WHILST CRYING OUT FOR CONVERSATION. ARGENTINA'S DISINGENUOUS CALL FOR DIALOGUE IS IN REALITY A CALL TO COLONISE OUR COUNTRY, SEIZE OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND DENY OUR RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION. -- THIS FEED AND ITS CONTENTS ARE THE PROPERTY OF THE HUFFINGTON POST, AND USE IS SUBJECT TO OUR TERMS. IT MAY BE USED FOR PERSONAL CONSUMPTION, BUT MAY NOT BE DISTRIBUTED ON A WEBSITE. ON FRIDAY 4TH, MS CECILIA NAHN, ARGENTINA AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES, WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR THE HUFFINGTON POST, TITLED 'MALVINAS: ALL ARGENTINA  IS SAYING IS GIVE DIALOGUE A CHANCE.' IN THE ARTICLE, AMBASSADOR NAHN DESCRIBED HOW OLD POLITICAL DISPUTES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE BEING SOLVED AS A RESULT OF 'A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE AND DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS.' AMB. NAHN WENT ON TO DETAIL HOW THE QUESTION OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS WAS AN '182-YEAR OLD SOVEREIGNTY DISPUTE WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM', IN REFERENCE TO THE REASSERTION OF BRITISH SOVEREIGNTY OF THE ISLANDS IN 1833. ARGENTINA REFERS TO THIS AS THE 'USURPATION' OF THE ISLANDS, AND CLAIMS THAT THE ENTIRE ARGENTINA POPULATION WAS FORCIBLY EJECTED FROM THE ISLANDS, ALTHOUGH RECORDS WITHIN THE ARGENTINE NATIONAL ARCHIVES SHOW THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA STATES REGULARLY THAT ITS CLAIM TO THE FALKLAND ISLANDS RUNS CONTINUOUSLY FROM THE 1820S. IT DOES NOT. THE ARGENTINE CLAIM TO SPANISH SUCCESSION, WHICH WAS NEVER ACCEPTED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM, WAS ENDED BY THE 'CONVENTION OF PEACE', RATIFIED IN 1850, AND FOR 34 YEARS ARGENTINA WAS SILENT OVER THE FALKLANDS, DURING WHICH TIME SEVERAL ARGENTINE LEADERS STATED THAT ARGENTINA HAD NO DISPUTE WITH BRITAIN. THERE WAS A BRIEF FLURRY OF LETTERS IN THE 1880S BUT AFTER THAT, THE 'CLAIM' TO THE ISLANDS WAS DROPPED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA UNTIL THE 1930S.

809	NOT SO LONG AGO, I PUT UP SOME WARNINGS ON THE APPROACHES WE OFTEN SEE ON INNOVATION CULTURE AND HOW COMPANIES AND THEIR EXECUTIVES, MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES TRY TO BUILD THIS HIGHLY DESIRED INNOVATION CULTURE. AS YOU CAN READ IN THIS POST, THE PERFECT STORM: WHY BIG COMPANIES GET BETTER AT INNOVATION , I ARGUE THAT YOU CANT REALLY DEVELOP A CULTURE OF INNOVATION WHEN YOU STRUGGLE TO DEFINE WHAT INNOVATION MEANS TO YOUR COMPANY AND THAT YOU CANT REALLY COPY THE INITIATIVES OF GOOGLE, APPLE OR 3M AS THEY HAVE DEVELOPED THEIR OWN UNIQUE CULTURES. THUS, I OFTEN URGE COMPANIES TO STOP USING THE TERM INNOVATION CULTURE AND THEN THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT TO DO INSTEAD. I GIVE SOME HINTS IN THE PERFECT STORM ARTICLE, BUT I ALSO REALLY LIKED SOME SNIPPETS FROM AN INTERVIEW WITH YUVAL DVIR FROM GOOGLE, WHO WILL GIVE A PRESENTATION AT THE CHIEF INNOVATION OFFICER SUMMIT IN LONDON ON OCT 22-23. IN HIS RESPONSES TO A FEW QUESTIONS, YUVAL DVIR PROVIDES SOME RELEVANT INSIGHTS. THE KEY ONES FOR ME IN THE CONTEXT OF THINKING LESS OF AN INNOVATION CULTURE ARE TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING THE RIGHT WORK CULTURE AND CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE ALONGSIDE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TENSION. SEE THE EXCERPT BELOW. WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE KEY CHALLENGE THAT YOU ARE ADDRESSING? WORK CULTURE. DIGITAL REQUIRES A DIFFERENT FOUNDATION FROM THE EMPLOYEES, LEADERSHIP AND TEAMS. UNLESS COMPANIES ARE WILLING TO CHANGE THOSE ELEMENTS, THEY WILL NEVER FULLY MATERIALIZE THE POTENTIAL OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND END UP WITH PARTIAL, INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT TRANSFORMATION IS A GRADUAL PROCESS THAT PROGRESSES INCREMENTALLY AND THATS OK; PEOPLE FIRST NEED TO UNLEARN THINGS BEFORE THEY LEARN THE NEW AND BETTER WAYS OF WORKING AND LIKE ANYTHING NEW, THEY NEED THE TIME AND SUPPORT TO GO THROUGH THAT. SO AS LONG AS THE MOTIVATION, WILLINGNESS AND INTENT IS THERE, WITH THE SUPPORT OF SENIOR LEADERSHIP REAL DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION SUCCESS AND THE COMPANY WITH ITS EMPLOYEES ARE THE ONES TO REAP THE BENEFIT. HOW DO YOU LIBERATE PEOPLE, WITHOUT UNLEASHING CHAOS? I BELIEVE THAT CREATING THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE IN THE COMPANY WITH THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TENSIONS (SINCE THE BASIC IDEA OF INNOVATION GOES AGAINST ANY SORT OF LIMITATIONS; EITHER BY PROCESS, POLICIES, STRUCTURE OR RULES, EVEN A SUBTLE RESTRAINT CAN TRIGGER A NEGATIVE REACTION IN THE MINDS OF THOSE TRYING TO INNOVATE, RED) IS THE WAY TO GO. FINDING THE SWEET SPOTS BETWEEN THESE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS IS WHAT MAKES YOUR COMPANYS CULTURE, WHICH IS CENTRE TO A CONDUCIVE INNOVATION ENVIRONMENT. YOU CAN CHECK OUT THE FULL INTERVIEW WITH YUVAL DVIR HERE AND YOU CAN MEET HIM AT THE CHIEF INNOVATION OFFICER SUMMIT IN LONDON OCTOBER.

ITS LITERALLY A ONE-IN-A-MILLION SENSATION. YOUR FRIENDS CANT STOP PLAYING IT. THE WORLDS EDGIEOST COMEDIANS CANT STOP REFERENCING IT AND NOW ITS HEADING TO THE BIG SCREEN! WHAT SORT OF BLOCKBUS OH, HANG ON, MY FAULT, SORRY. I THOUGHT IT WAS 2012. LET ME START AGAIN. ANGRY BIRDS IS THAT IPHONE GAME THAT PEOPLE USED TO PLAY A LOT THREE YEARS AGO BUT DONT ANY MORE. AND NOW ITS GOING TO BE A FILM. AND THERES A TRAILER FOR IT. THERE, THATS BETTER. STILL, WHILE WERE HERE, LETS GIVE THE ANGRY BIRDS TRAILER A CLOSER ZLOOK. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST WE OPEN WITH A SHOT OF THE CHARACTER WERE MOST LIKELY TO REMEMBER FROM THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED ANGRY BIRDS SEVERAL YEARS AGO NAMELESS RED BIRD. HERES NAMELESS RED BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. SO FAR, THIS IS A BIRD EATING A SANDWICH. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST ALSO PRESENT, THREE SEXY BIRDS. AT LEAST I ASSUME THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY.  NOT THIS WEEK, HERITAGE. DONT DO THIS WHILE NEBULOUS ALMOST-BESTIALITY IS SUCH A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE. GET IT TOGETHER. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, PHEW, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY AFTER ALL. AND THEY WERE AIMING ALL THEIR RED-HOT SEXUALITY AT THAT HUNKY SORT-OF BLUEISH BIRD. I HOPE THE RED BIRDS OK, AND DIDNT MISTAKENLY THINK THE OTHER BIRDS WERE ACCTUALLY COMING ON TO HIM. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST AH. HE DID. AND BY THE LOOK OF IT HE HASNT TAKEN THE REJECTION WELL. IN FACT, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT HES NOW A FAIRLY ANGRY BIRD. SEE WHAT I DID THERE? THAT WAS CLEVER OF ME WASNT IT? SO ANGRY IS NAMELESS RED BIRD, IIN FACT, THAT HE APPEARS TO HAVE ENROLLED IN SOME SORT OF ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME, ALONG WITH AN ANNOYING YELLOW BIRD PLAYED BY THE ANNOYING MAN WHO PLAYED THE ANNOYING SNOWMAN IN FROZEN. TYPECASTING ISSUES ASIDE, THOUGH, THIS LITERALLY SEEMS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE A FILM ABOUT SOME AQNGRY BIRDS. THATS LITERALLY WHAT THIS FILM IS. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR THE BLACK BLOWY-UP UP BIRD IS ALSO ANGRY, BECAUSE HES JUST BLOWN UP. WOW, THESE PEOPLE HAVE REALLY GRABBED THE WHOLE ANGRY BIRDS IDEA BY ITS MOST LITERAL END AND IT, HAVENT THEY? FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST BUT ITS OK, BECAUSE HERES A PIG, WHICH YOU MIGHT REMEMBER IS THE MORTAL ENEMY OF THE ANGRY BIRDS. PRETTY SOON THESE PIGS WILL BE CONSTRUCTING DANGEROUSLY RAMSHACKLE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES, AND THE BIRDS WILL KAMIKAZE INTO THEM AS REVENGE. IF MY MEMORY IS CORRECT, THE BIRDS ALL DIE AS SOON AS THEYVE BEEN CATAPULTED AT THE PIGS, WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE WILL ACTUALLY TURN UP TO BE A SORROWFUL MEDITATION ON THE WAR. FACEBOOK TWITTER PINTEREST A PHOTOGRAPH: PR OH, WRONG AGAIN. ITS JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME ANGRY BIRDS. THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE IS LITERALLY JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT SOME BIRDS WHO GET ANGRY SOMETIMES. HOPEFULLY CLEAR FLAWS WILL ALL BE ADDRESSED ADDRESSED AND IRONED OUT BY THE TIME THEY MAKE A FILM ABOUT YOUR SECOND-FAVOURITE IPHONE APP, GOOGLE MAPS.

MANY ACNE SKIN CARE TREATMENTS CAN HELP TO ELIMINATE ACNE INFLAMMATION NEVERTHELESS THEY DO NOT REMOVE ACNE PIT SCARS. IT'S'S BETTER TO USE A GENTLE CLEANSING AGENT.

AND IN THE CASE OF PROCLAIMING A NEW SPECIES THE GAP IS REALLY LARGE," SAID CHRISTOPH ZOLLIKOFER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH.OTHERS SAY THE FOSSILS BELONG TO AN ALREADY-NAMED SPECIES.THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S TIM WHITE SAID FROM WHAT HE HAD SEEN, THE FOSSILS BELONGED TO HOMO ERECTUS, A SPECIES DISCOVERED IN THE LATE 19TH CENTURY."NEW SPECIES SHOULD NOT BE CREATED WILLY-NILLY. IN ORDER TO CLAIM A NEW SPECIES ONE HAS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING THAT'S EVER BEEN KNOWN," HE SAID.WHITE NOTED THE PUBLISHED FINDINGS INCLUDED A TABLE COMPARING 83 ANATOMICAL FEATURES OF NALEDI WITH OTHER SPECIES."WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THOSE CHARACTERS WHERE IT'S CLAIMED TO DIFFER FROM HOMO ERECTUS, YOU FIND THAT THE PORTRAYAL OF HOMO ERECTUS IS OFTEN INACCURATE. AND ONLY 13 OF THE 83 CHARACTERS ARE EVEN ALLEGED TO BE DIFFERENT," HE SAID.QUESTIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE FAILURE TO DATE THE FIND AND THE THEORY THAT THE SPECIES MIGHT HAVE DISPOSED OF ITS DEAD, WHICH HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS THE MOST PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO FOR THE BONES' PLACING IN THE CAVE BUT IS ULTIMATELY A GUESS.NALEDI'S LEAD SCIENTIST, LEE BERGER OF JOHANNESBURG'S UNIVERSITY OF THE WITWATERSRAND, COUNTERED THAT HIS CRITICS WERE THE ONES SHOWING HASTE.HE SAID THEY SHOULD NOT "SHOOT FROM THE HIP BASED ON THEIR PRE-CONCEIVED IDEAS BUT LOOK AT THESE PAPERS AND GIVE A THOUGHTFUL CRITIQUE IN THE PEER-REVIEWED LITERATURE.""WE WERE ABLE TO MASS THE INTELLECTUAL POWER AND ENERGY OF MORE THAN 60 SCIENTISTS ... THAT LOGICALLY SPEEDS THINGS UP."A DOZEN PAPERS ON THE FINDS WERE SUBMITTED TO THE HIGHLY REGARDED JOURNAL "NATURE" BUT WERE NOT PUBLISHED THERE."NATURE PUBLISHES SHORT ARTICLES ON MAJOR DISCOVERIES," BERGER SAID."WE ATTEMPTED TO PUT THE 12 IN AND THIS WAS SIMPLY TOO MUCH."BERGER, A JOCULAR AMERICAN WITH A FLARE FOR SHOWMANSHIP, HAS SEEN THIS KIND OF ACADEMIC INFIGHTING BEFORE. IN 1995, HE AND A COLLEAGUE PROPOSED THE 'TAUNG CHILD', A FAMED HOMININ FOSSIL UNEARTHED IN 1924, HAD BEEN KILLED BY AN EAGLE - A CONTROVERSIAL CLAIM AT THE TIME.A DECADE LATER, A STUDY ON PRIMATE PREDATION BY CROWNED EAGLES PROVIDED BERGER WITH HIS SMOKING GUN - THE PUNCTURE MARKS IN THE EYE SOCKETS OF THE MODERN MONKEYS MATCHED THOSE IN THE TAUNG CHILD'S.(EDITING BY LARRY KING)JOIN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS STORY CLICK HERE TO READ FULL NEWS..
814	STREET CLEANERS COULD ONLY BE PAID IF THEY DO A GOOD JOB AND RESIDENTS MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE DEALS WITH THE COUNCIL UNDER PROPOSED PLANS TO CUT THE BUDGET. THE IDEAS WERE BROUGHT UP AT THE FIRST KINGSTON CONVERSATION EVENT LAST NIGHT WHERE RESIDENTS WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OF COUNCIL LEADER KEVIN DAVIS. DURING THE CONVERSATION IN SOUTHBOROUGH HIGH SCHOOL HALL THE AUDIENCE WERE TOLD THAT BY 2018 THE COUNCIL BUDGET WILL BE 45 PER CENT LESS THAN IT WAS IN 2010. COUN DAVIS LAID OUT THE THREE GREAT CHALLENGES HE BELIEVES ARE FACING THE COUNCIL AS COMMUNICATION WITH CITIZENS, THE GROWTH AGENDA AND WHAT SHAPE THE COUNCIL OF THE FUTURE WILL TAKE. HE SAID: NO ONE WANTS TO SEE COUNCIL TAX RISE BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT TO DO ABOUT THAT? WHAT ARE THE SERVICES THAT WE ARE GOING TO SAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANYMORE? RECYCLING AND WASTE COLLECTION, THE COUNCIL SPENDING MONEY UNNECESSARILY AND TOLWORTH BEING THE FORGOTTEN END OF THE BOROUGH WERE ALL MAIN ISSUES FOR SOUTH OF THE BOROUGH RESIDENTS. COUN DAVIS BROUGHT UP A CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH RESIDENTS PREVIOUSLY WHERE A STREET HAD CLUBBED TOGETHER TO GET A GRASS VERGE. PROMOTED STORIES THE COUNCIL AGREED TO PUT IT IN THE VERGE IF RESIDENTS WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF ITS UPKEEP. HE SAID: WE GOT TOGETHER WITH RESIDENTS AND SAID WE ARE PREPARED TO DO A DEAL HERE. IT IS THAT TYPE OF DECISION WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE. COUNCILLOR ANDREA CRAIG JOINED COUN DAVIS ON STAGE AND SAID THE COUNCIL COULD ADOPT A SYSTEM TRIALLED BY HAMMERSMITH COUNCIL WHERE CLEANERS WERE ONLY PAID IF THEY DID A GOOD JOB. SHE SAID: WE [AS A COUNCIL] HAVE TO DO A LOT BETTER WITH OUR CONTRACTS. WE NEED TO HAVE BETTER MANAGEMENT. AFTER THE EVENT COUN DAVIS SAID HE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE TURNOUT OF 80 PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL HALL AND 20 PEOPLE WATCHING THE LIVE STREAM ONLINE. AFTER THE EVENT HE SAID: WE NEED TO BE TALKING MORE TO PEOPLE. BIG DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE ABOUT OUR BUDGET AND WHAT WE NEED TO BE GETTING PEOPLE INVOLVED THEM. THIS WAS A GOOD TURNOUT FOR THE FIRST ONE. THE SECOND OF EIGHT KINGSTON CONVERSATION EVENTS IS IN THE RICHARD MAYO CENTRE, EDEN STREET ON SEPTEMBER 10.

815	THERE ARE MANY TRAINING METHODS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYEE EDUCATION WITHIN A GOVERNMENT AGENCY: ONLINE COURSEWARE; VIRTUAL CLASSROOM; IN-PERSON, TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT; OR A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE. WHATEVER THE CHOICE, AN ORGANIZATIONS FUTURE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES SHOULD BE THE TRAINING MISSION, WITH THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL FRONT AND CENTER. IDEALLY, AN EMPLOYEES INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN WOULD MESH WITH THE AGENCYS VISION AND ITS OPERATIONAL NECESSITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INDIVIDUALS CAREER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. A ROBUST AND WELL-DESIGNED TRAINING PROGRAM THAT CONSIDERS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND TALENT GAPS IS ALSO AN EFFECTIVE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL. CASE IN POINT AS A COLLEGE GRADUATE, I ENTERED A SOPHISTICATED ARMY CIVILIAN TRAINING PROGRAM IN WHAT HAS NOW EVOLVED INTO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. THAT PROGRAM INCLUDED MANDATORY CLASSES, FUNCTIONAL HUMAN RESOURCES TRAINING, AND A TWO-YEAR ROTATIONAL ASSIGNMENT WITH A MANDATORY GEOGRAPHIC MOVE. FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE, I DID NOT KNOW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF WORKING IN A FEDERAL ORGANIZATION, BUT THE TRAINING PROGRAM GAVE ME THE FOUNDATIONAL EDUCATION I NEEDED TO BOTH PERFORM MY JOB WELL AND ADVANCE MY FUTURE CAREER. INDEED, IT HELPED ME BECOME THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE WHO WAS AN ASSET TO MY ORGANIZATIONS FUTURE. MATCHING METHOD TO GOALS AS FAR AS SPECIFIC LEARNING METHODS GO, NONE STAND OUT AS SUPERIOR. INDIVIDUAL NEEDS, LEARNING STYLES, AND ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN DECIDING WHICH EDUCATIONAL TOOLS WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES. FOR INSTANCE, TOTAL IMMERSION MAY NOT ALWAYS GIVE THE BEST RESULT, AS SOME EMPLOYEES MAY BE MORE APT TO LEARN IN A HANDS-ON ENVIRONMENT OR THROUGH SMALLER BURSTS OF INFORMATION. MEANWHILE, THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN INVALUABLE AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE NETWORKING TOOL. CONSEQUENTLY, SPENDING TIME LEARNING WITH PEERS IN AN EMPLOYEES SAME DISCIPLINE OR AREA OF INTEREST CAN RESULT IN LASTING SUPPORT AND SYNERGY THAT ENDURES THROUGHOUT AND BEYOND FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT. CLASSROOM INSTRUCTORS CAN ALSO SERVE AS VALUABLE RESOURCES FOR THE FUTURE. HOW ARE YOU DESIGNING YOUR TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MEET FUTURE AGENCY GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS? CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH AL RESSLER DURING THE SKILL SETUP: CHOOSING THE RIGHT TRAINING FOR THE RIGHT TASK SESSION DURING THE GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE: LEARNING INNOVATIONS CONFERENCE.
816	CALGARY, ALBERTA?THE CANADIAN UNIT OF CHINESE STATE-CONTROLLED ENERGY GIANT CNOOC LTD. SAID SUNDAY IT WOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THREE-QUARTERS OF ITS PRODUCTION AT A TROUBLED OIL-SANDS OPERATION AFTER REGULATORY AUTHORITIES PARTIALLY LIFTED A SUSPENSION ORDER THAT THREATENED TO COMPLETELY HALT ITS OUTPUT. CNOOC SUBSIDIARY NEXEN ENERGY ULC SAID ALBERTA'S CHIEF ENERGY REGULATOR AMENDED AN ORDER THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED IT TO SHUT DOWN 95 PIPELINES AT ITS 50,000 BARREL A DAY LONG LAKE HEAVY OIL EXTRACTION FACILITY IN NORTHERN ALBERTA. "AS A RESULT, NEXEN IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN APPROXIMATELY 75% OF OUR LONG LAKE OIL SANDS PRODUCTION AND UPGRADER OPERATIONS," THE COMPANY SAID IN A STATEMENT POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE. ON AUG. 28, THE ALBERTA ENERGY REGULATOR ISSUED THE SUSPENSION ORDER, WHICH AFFECTED ABOUT ONE-QUARTER OF THE PIPELINES INSTALLED AT LONG LAKE, FOR SUSPECTED FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN RULES. THE THREAT OF A SHUTDOWN, WHICH WOULD HAVE TAKEN TWO WEEKS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT, LOOMED AS THE LATEST IN A STRING OF SETBACKS AT THE NEXEN PLANT, WHICH STARTED UP IN 2008 BUT HAS NEVER REACHED ITS CAPACITY OF 72,000 BARRELS A DAY. OF THE PIPELINES INITIALLY TARGETED, SOME 55 REMAIN SUSPENDED AND 45 OTHERS CAN NOW BE OPERATED, THE AER SAID SUNDAY. ITS DECISION TO PARTIALLY LIFT THE SUSPENSION ORDER CAME AFTER A DETERMINATION THAT SOME "UTILITY" PIPELINES MET ALL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS, IT SAID. "THE AER IS SATISFIED THAT THE COMPANY HAS MET THE REQUIREMENTS DETAILED IN THE SUSPENSION ORDER BY DEMONSTRATING THAT THESE UTILITY LINES CAN BE OPERATED SAFELY," SAID AER SPOKESWOMAN CARRIE ROSA. THE INITIAL REGULATORY ACTION WAS PROMPTED BY AN INTERNAL AUDIT AT NEXEN IN WHICH THE COMPANY IDENTIFIED "A NUMBER OF NON-COMPLIANCES" MOSTLY INVOLVING ITS DOCUMENTATION OF PIPELINE MAINTENANCE. THE AER SAID THOSE PIPELINES CARRY NATURAL GAS, CRUDE OIL, FRESH AND WASTEWATER AS WELL AS CRUDE OIL MIXED WITH SAND. NEXEN HAD ALREADY CUT PRODUCTION AT LONG LAKE BY 9,000 BARRELS A DAY IN JULY AFTER THE RUPTURE OF A PIPELINE ON SITE THAT SPILLED 31,500 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL, WASTEWATER AND SAND. THE AER'S SUSPENSION ORDER CAME AMID THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THAT LEAK. THOSE PROBLEMS HAVE GIVEN A BLACK EYE TO PARENT COMPANY CNOOC, WHICH BOUGHT NEXEN FOR $15 BILLION IN 2013 AND INSTALLED ITS OWN MANAGEMENT TEAM TO RUN IT LAST YEAR. THE THREATENED SHUTDOWN OF LONG LAKE AND AN UNRELATED ACCIDENT THAT HAS HALTED OUTPUT AT A MORE THAN 200,000 BARREL-A-DAY CANADIAN OIL SANDS LTD. HEAVY OIL PROCESSING FACILITY HAS INCREASED PRICES FOR CANADIAN SYNTHETIC CRUDE IN RECENT TRADING. CANADA'S TOTAL OIL-SANDS PRODUCTION IS AROUND 2 MILLION BARRELS A DAY, MUCH OF WHICH IS EXPORTED TO THE U. S.?THE LARGEST CONSUMER OF CANADIAN CRUDE. WRITE TO CHESTER DAWSON AT CHESTER.DAWSON@WSJ.COM
817	HOW DOES IT FEEL BEING 70 TODAY? I FEEL GREAT, HAPPY AND EXCITED THAT BY THE GRACE OF GOD, ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ATTAIN THE AGE OF 70. FOR ME, IT IS A BLESSING. I AM REALLY GRATEFUL TO GOD. A LOT OF PEOPLE ATTRIBUTE GOOD LOOKS AS HEALTH, BUT I WOULD ATTRIBUTE IT TO GOD. WHAT ROLE DID YOUR WIFE, BISHOP PEACE, PLAY IN ALL THESE? SHE IS PLAYING A WONDERFUL ROLE. I CANNOT THANK GOD ENOUGH FOR THE KIND OF WIFE HE HAS GIVEN TO ME. I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT EVEN WHEN IT IS NOT TRUE, BUT I AM BEING HONEST. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TOLD OURSELVES AT THE OUTSET IS THAT I AM NOT JUST HUSBAND TO PEACE, BUT HUSBAND TO EVERY WOMAN IN OUR CHURCH AND ALSO FATHER TO EVERYONE. IF YOU HAVE A WIFE THAT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED INTO, AND WHO IS POSSESSIVE, SHE WILL BE THE ONE TO DESTROY THE WORK. FOR ME, I DONT KNOW HOW I WOULD HAVE SURVIVED IF WE WERE FIGHTING EVERYDAY, THEN THE HUGE RESPONSIBILITY THAT I HAVE IN THE CHURCH WOULDNT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED. I HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING WIFE. IN ADDITION, SHE HAS HELPED TO COVER SOME OF MY OWN WEAKNESSES. WHAT WAS THE REACTION OF YOUR PARENTS TO YOUR CALLING? THEY WERE ANGRY WITH ME. THEY COULDNT UNDERSTAND IT, I WAS WORKING IN THE BANK, THE THEN AFRICAN CONTINENTAL BANK ON MARTINS STREET, LAGOS. THEY SAID OF ALL PLACES IT WAS PENTECOSTAL CHURCH (WHICH TO THEM WAS ALADURA) OF ALL CHURCHES. THEY FUMED OVER MY DECISION. THEY SAID: IF YOU WANT TO ANSWER THE CALL OF GOD, GO TO ANGLICAN OR CATHOLIC CHURCH, OR ANY OTHER ORTHODOX CHURCH. AT A STAGE, THEY WENT TO ARRANGE FOR MY ARREST, BUT I WAS RESOLUTE. THE MINISTRY STARTED GROWING; EVEN AT AKOKA WHERE WE STARTED. LATER, THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE THE GREATNESS OF WHAT GOD WANTED ME TO DO. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU ENCOUNTERED ? THERE ARE SEVERAL CHALLENGES IN THE MINISTRY, IN EACH STEP THAT ONE TAKES. ONE CHALLENGE LEADS TO ANOTHER. I RECALL THAT IN DECEMBER 1984, WE WENT TO A CRUSADE IN ABEOKUTA, OGUN STATE. WE CAME BACK BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND ON CHRISTMAS EVE, OUR DAUGHTER DEVELOPED HIGH FEVER AND IN THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 26 SHE DIED. IT WAS A DAY I WAS GOING TO PREACH. AFTER PRAYING AND SHE DID NOT COME TO LIFE, I LEFT HER IN THE ROOM AND WENT TO PREACH. I DID NOT MENTION WHAT HAPPENED TO ANYONE. AS A MINISTER, THIS IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES YOU FACE. OUR PARENTS HAD SIX MALES AND FOUR FEMALES. THE ONLY SUPPORT I GOT FROM MY FAMILY IN MY CALLING WAS CUT SHORT. ONE OF MY BROTHERS HAD PASSED THE HIGH LEVEL EXAMINATION AND WAS TO GO FOR MEDICINE. BUT MY PARENTS REFUSED TO LET HIM GO AS A WAY OF PUNISHING HIM FOR SUPPORTING MY CAUSE AS A MINISTER. THEY ALSO WANTED TO SEE IF THAT COULD MAKE ME CHANGE MY MIND. IT DIDNT. AND EVENTUALLY, HE STILL WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY, PASSED AS A MEDICAL DOCTOR, JOINED THE NAVY AND STILL SUPPORTED ME IN THE MINISTRY. HE WAS ONE OF OUR PRAISE AND WORSHIP LEADERS. IN THE LATE 80S, I ASKED HIM TO CONDUCT AN INTERVIEW ON MY BEHALF WHEN I WAS TRAVELLING OUT. IT WAS WHEN ARMED ROBBERY WAS BECOMING AN ISSUE; SOME ROBBERS FOLLOWED HIM TO HIS CAR, CLOSED-IN ON HIM INSIDE THE CHURCH COMPOUND AND ASKED HIM TO BRING THE KEY OF HIS PEUGEOT 504 CAR. I THINK THE MILITARY INSTINCT IN HIM MADE HIM TO RESIST THEM AND HE STARTED FIGHTING THEM AND HE WAS SHOT. THEY TOOK HIM TO ONE HOSPITAL IN AKOKA, LAGOS WHERE HE COULD NOT BE MANAGED, YET HE WAS NOT REFERRED. I GOT WIND OF THE SITUATION WHILE ABROAD AND I ASKED THAT THEY MOVE HIM TO A BETTER HOSPITAL, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS LATE, HE DIED. BUT I MADE UP MY MIND THAT CHALLENGES WOULD NOT MAKE ME REJECT THE CALL OF GOD. I TOLD MYSELF THAT THE BEST I COULD DO IS TO BE THE BEST IN WHAT GOD HAS CALLED ME INTO. THERE WERE ALSO CHALLENGES OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH FUNDS. ALL THAT I HAVE DONE HAD BEEN BY FAITH. UP TILL NOW, WE DEPEND ON GOD FOR EVERY PROJECT. WHEN THE CHURCH STARTED GROWING, WE HAD NO PLACE TO GO AND WE STARTED HAVING OUR PROGRAMMES AT THE STADIUM. WE WERE EVENTUALLY DIRECTED HERE. IT WAS NOT THE KIND OF PLACE THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO BUILD ON. IT WAS WATER-LOGGED. THE BIG QUESTION THEN WAS, HOW WOULD IT HAPPEN? BUT AGAIN, THE LORD BUILT HIS HOUSE. WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR EXPERIENCES, ESPECIALLY, BEFORE YOUR CALL? MY FATHER HAD BEEN IN LAGOS FOR A WHILE BEFORE WE MOVED IN. WHEN WE MOVED TO LAGOS, WE WERE LIVING IN A PLACE CALLED BRICKFIELD IN APAPA. I WAS SCHOOLING AT IJERO BAPTIST SCHOOL, EBUTE META AND AS THE YEARS WENT BY, MY FATHER, A DISCIPLINARIAN, FELT THAT I NEEDED TO LEAVE HOME AND LIVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE. WE WERE A BIT COMFORTABLE; HE WAS A SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT IN THE POST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS (P&T). HE MOVED ME FIRST TO OFFA IN 1957 TO LIVE WITH AN UNCLE IN OFFA GRAMMAR SCHOOL, OFFA, KWARA STATE. LATER ON, I MOVED TO MAYFLOWER GRAMMAR SCHOOL, IKENNE, OGUN STATE UNDER TAI SOLARIN FOR TWO YEARS. THERE WAS PEER PRESSURE AND THE FACT THAT I DID NOT SPEAK IGBO VERY WELL MADE MY FRIENDS TAUNT ME. SO, I TOLD MY PARENTS THAT I WANTED TO CHANGE SCHOOL. I CHANGED TO MERCHANT OF LIFE SCHOOL IN THE EAST NOW ANAMBRA STATE WHERE I GRADUATED IN 1963. I WAS A MEMBER OF THE CHOIR OF ST JUDES CHURCH, EBUTE META WITH MY SISTER.. WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL, I WORKED IN THE PORTS AUTHORITY IN LAGOS FOR A FEW MONTHS. WHAT I SAW THERE WAS FRIGHTENING HOW MONEY CHANGED HANDS. I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT AND I TOLD MY PARENTS THAT THE PLACE WAS NOT FOR ME. SO, AGAIN, I HAD TO LEAVE. I MOVED TO AFRICAN CONTINENTAL BANK. EVEN AS CASHIER IN ACB, I REMEMBER ONE DAY, AS I WENT FOR LUNCH, SOMEBODY FOLLOWED ME AND ASKED THAT I SHOULD CHANGE SOME COUNTERFEIT MONEY FOR HIM, SAYING HE WOULD GIVE ME A SHARE FROM IT. I WAS AFRAID AND I RAN AWAY BECAUSE I FELT SOMEBODY COULD BE LISTENING. IT WAS DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND WE WERE AFRAID AS NON-INDIGENES, SO, I ASKED FOR A TRANSFER AND I WAS MOVED TO ONITSHA. THEREAFTER, THE CIVIL WAR INTENSIFIED, THE NIGERIAN TROOPS CONQUERED ONITSHA, WE THEN MOVED TO AWKA AND FROM THERE AGAIN, TO PORT HARCOURT. AT THAT POINT, DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF ACB WERE MOVING, EVENTUALLY, WE CAME TO OWERRI. IN OWERRI, THE MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ME BUT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY JOB. HE FELT I SHOULD BE COMING AROUND HIM LIKE OTHER PEOPLE, BUT I FELT THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THAT. AS THE WAR INTENSIFIED, THEY WERE RECRUITING PEOPLE INTO THE ARMY BY FORCE. ALTHOUGH BANKING WAS VIEWED AS PART OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES DURING THE WAR, AS THE WAR INTENSIFIED, THEY STARTED RECRUITING FROM THE BANKS AS WELL. DURING ONE OF THE DAYS THAT THEY CAME FOR RECRUITMENT, THEY CONSCRIPTED SOME PEOPLE INTO THE ARMY, BUT THEY MISSED ME BECAUSE I HAD GONE TO BUY CIGARETTE. THE MANAGER WAS NOT TOO HAPPY THAT I WAS NOT PART OF THEM. I DID NOT KNOW WHY HE WANTED ME IN THE ARMY. HE WENT TO THE CAMP AND SECURED THE RELEASE OF THOSE SELECTED AND ASKED THAT THE EXERCISE SHOULD BE REPEATED AND THROUGH A BALLOT SYSTEM. AGAIN, I ESCAPED BEING RECRUITED INTO THE ARMY. HE WAS NOT STILL HAPPY. AGAIN, HE ASKED THE MILITARY OFFICERS TO COME TO THE OFFICE AND PICK WHOEVER THEY WANTED ALL BECAUSE OF ME. WE WERE BUSY AT THE COUNTER THAT DAY WHEN SUDDENLY, THE MANAGER SENT FOR ME AND TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES. IN HIS OFFICE, WE MET A MILITARY CAPTAIN AND HIS ASSISTANT. THE MANAGER SAID, GENTLEMEN, THE HEADQUARTERS SAID WE SHOULD HAND YOU OVER TO THE CAPTAIN. I WANTED TO RUN AWAY, BUT THE CAPTAIN SAID HE WOULD SHOOT ME IF I DARED. THEN I ASKED THEM TO GIVE US TIME TO HAND OVER OFFICIALLY. THEY AGREED, AND AS SOON AS WE STEPPED OUT OF THE MANAGERS OFFICE, WE RAN AWAY. I RAN FOR MILES BUT AGAIN, I FOUND MYSELF IN A MILITARY CAMP WHERE ONE OF MY CLASSMATES WAS IN CHARGE. I TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED. THAT WAS HOW I STOPPED WORKING IN ACB. FROM THERE, I WENT TO LOOK FOR MY PARENTS WHERE THEY WERE BEING HELD AS REFUGEES. BY THEN, DR ILOH WAS IN CHARGE OF THE RED CROSS. I STAYED WITH HIM FOR A FEW MONTHS. THE WAR INTENSIFIED AND I WAS AFRAID THEY WERE GOING TO CATCH ME ON THE STREETS TO JOIN THE ARMY BECAUSE THAT WAS THE NORM. SO, WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT I COULD NOT ESCAPE, I TOLD MY PARENTS THAT MY BROTHER AND I HAVE TO WILLINGLY GO AND REGISTER IN THE MILITARY. SO, WE DID, AND THE TRAINING WENT FOR THREE MONTHS. BUT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD, WE NEVER FIRED ONE SHOT. AFTER THE THIRD MONTH, WE GOT A PASS TO SEE OUR PARENTS AND THAT SAME DAY, WE WERE TOLD THEY WERE MOVING US TO THE FORCE HEADQUARTERS AND TO GABON FOR FURTHER TRAINING SINCE GABON HAD RECOGNISED BIAFRA. I TOLD MY BROTHER NOT TO TAKE THE ARMS AND AMMUNITION WHEN OUR COLLEAGUES WERE BEING GIVEN ARMS. I ASKED HIM TO FOLLOW ME. WE WENT THROUGH THE GATE AND THE SENTRY THERE SENSED THAT WE WANTED TO ESCAPE, BUT WE TOLD HIM THAT ONE OF THE OFFICERS LEFT HIS CLOTHES SOMEWHERE AND HE SENT US TO GET THEM. SURPRISINGLY, HE AGREED. AS SOON AS WE GOT OUT OF THE GATE, WE DISAPPEARED INTO THE BUSH. THE NEXT DAY, THE WAR ENDED. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARIS WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION? EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT CORRUPTION HAS KILLED US. IT IS NOT ONLY ENDEMIC, IN FACT, IT HAS GOT TO THE EXTENT THAT IF YOU ARE NOT CORRUPT, YOU WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED A GOOD NIGERIAN. THAT IS THE LEVEL WE HAVE DEGENERATED. AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE CALLING BUHARI MR GO-SLOW. HOW DO YOU WANT HIM TO CLEAR THE MESS OF 16 YEARS IN 100 DAYS? I DONT KNOW WHY WE ARE NEVER TRUTHFUL WITH OURSELVES. IF THE ONLY THING BUHARI CAN ACHIEVE IS JUST TO INSTILL FEAR OF CORRUPTION, AND ALL THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND AGENCIES ARE WORKING TO DISSUADE CORRUPTION, THEN WE WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED A LOT. YOUR VIEW ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE? THE CHURCH SHOULD NOT BE SHOCKED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THE END-TIME EVENT. DONT ALSO BE SURPRISED IF OTHER STRANGE THINGS FOLLOW. I WONT BE SURPRISED IF BESTIALITY IS INTRODUCED. I WILL ONLY BE SHOCKED IF THE CHURCH GETS INVOLVED IN IT. IF NATIONS ENDORSE IT, NATIONS DONT GO BY THE BIBLE. THEY PLAY POLITICS. PARENTS MUST TALK TO THEIR CHILDREN AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT RIGHT. DID YOU EVER THINK THAT YOU WERE GOING TO GROW THIS BIG? YES, GOD GAVE ME VERY WONDERFUL PROMISES CONCERNING THE CHURCH; BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DID NOT BELIEVE IT. SO BY THE TIME IT HAPPENED, I WAS SHOCKED. EVERYTHING AROUND ME DID NOT SHOW THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE BIG LIKE THIS. BUT HE HAS DONE IT AND I AM EXCITED. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE GREATEST LESSONS YOU HAVE LEARNT ABOUT LIFE? YOU MUST BE READY FOR SHOCKERS. DONT THINK THAT EVERYBODY IS THE SAME. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SHOCKS, CHALLENGES AND PRESSURES. DIFFICULTIES ARE PART OF LIFE. LIFE IS MADE UP OF POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES. IT IS NEVER ONE-SIDED, IT IS MADE UP OF MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS. YOU HAVE TO SETTLE THIS IN YOUR MIND. DONT BE DISTURBED BECAUSE THEY ARE STEPPING STONES. IF I HAD ALLOWED THE CHALLENGES TO STOP ME, I WOULDNT HAVE BEEN WHERE I AM TODAY. RECENTLY, I WAS SHARING THE SAME THING WITH MY DAUGHTER. I TOLD HER THAT CHALLENGES CANNOT BUT COME AND ONE MUST LEARN TO STAND ONES GROUND, AND LEARN TO HOLD ONES HEAD HIGH. GIVING IS MORE THAN GIVING MONEY; IT IS GOOD ONE NOURISHES RELATIONSHIPS. GIVE AND MEN WOULD ADD TO IT; YOU CAN NEVER SUCCEED ALONE. SOME PEOPLE CLAIM, IM A SELF-MADE MAN, THIS IS A LIE, NO MAN IS SELF-MADE FOR YOU DID NOT GIVE BIRTH TO YOURSELF AND WHEN YOU DIE, YOU CANNOT BURY YOURSELF. DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS? I DONT THINK ALONG THIS LINE. WHAT I HAVE STUMBLED ON IN LIFE HAS STRENGTHENED AND HELPED ME. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BEEN SAVED EARLIER THAN THE TIME IT HAPPENED.. WHAT DOES YOUR MOTHER MEAN TO YOU? I AM MORE OF MY MOTHER THAN MY FATHER. SHE WAS AN INDUSTRIOUS AND A HARDWORKING WOMAN. SHE WAS A TRADER, IN ABADA AND GEORGE. I SOLD BREAD FOR HER IN LAGOS. MY MOTHER WAS A DISCIPLINARIAN, VERY TOUGH, BUT WE LOVED HER. SHE TOOK GREAT CARE OF US AND KEPT ENCOURAGING US TO MOVE ON IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CHALLENGES OF LIFE.
818	TORONTO: PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI'S THREE-DAY VISIT TO CANADA EARLIER THIS YEAR COST CANADIAN TAXPAYERS 373,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS (APPROXIMATELY RS. 1,87,06,539.43). THIS INCLUDES INCLUDING 80,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS ON RECEPTIONS AND 106,400 CANADIAN DOLLARS ON A MOTORCADE. THE EXPENSES INCLUDED 10,448 DOLLARS ON HOTEL ROOMS, 30,000 DOLLARS ON AUDIO VISUAL EQUIPMENT, 21,708 DOLLARS ON UNSPECIFIED CONSULTANTS, 73,213 DOLLARS ON PUBLIC SERVANTS' TRAVEL, 14,790 DOLLARS ON HEALTH SERVICES, 3,65,654 DOLLARS ON FLOWERS AND WREATHS, 1,584 DOLLARS ON GIFTS, 5,981 DOLLARS ON INTERPRETERS AND TRANSLATION AND 75 DOLLARS FOR A FLAG. THE BILL DID NOT INCLUDE SECURITY COSTS, A REPORT SAID. THE LARGEST EXPENSE ON A GATHERING AT AN ARENA IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO, AT WHICH CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER AND CONSERVATIVE LEADER STEPHEN HARPER SPOKE TO 10,000 MEMBERS OF THE INDO-CANADIAN COMMUNITY AND MODI WAS FETED, WAS HOWEVER NOT BORNE BY CANADIAN TAXPAYERS BUT BY PRIVATE CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES. THE EVENT AT THE RICOH COLISEUM COST ABOUT 600,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS, NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF INDO-CANADIANS' PRESIDENT AZAD KUMAR KAUSHIK SAID. THE EVENT BECAME CONTROVERSIAL AS IT GAVE A POLITICAL BOOST TO PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY (PCP) MP PATRICK BROWN, WHO WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR LEADERSHIP OF ONTARIO PROVINCE. KAUSHIK, HOWEVER, SAID, "WE DID NOT LOOK AT IT FROM AN ELECTORAL PERSPECTIVE. OUR GOAL WAS TO CREATE BONDING BETWEEN INDIA AND CANADA." HE SAID BY ORGANISING THIS MEGA RECEPTION FOR MODI, THE GROUP WANTED TO PROMOTE ENHANCED INVESTMENT AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS REMIND THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT THAT CANADA IS HOME TO AN IMPORTANT DIASPORA WHOSE NEEDS SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED. MEANWHILE, TIMMINS JAMES BAY MPP GILLES BISSON HAS DEMANDED THAT BROWN, WHO IS NOW LEADER OF THE PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVES, SHOULD PAY TAXPAYERS BACK FOR SOME OF THE COST OF THE MODI VISIT. "YOU CAN'T HAVE SOMEBODY DO A POLITICAL ACTIVITY AND THEN HAVE IT PAID BY THE STATE," BISSON SAID. "IT WAS A PRETTY BIG THING FOR BROWN'S LEADERSHIP BID, TO HAVE THIS PERSON SHOW UP, AND SAY HE'S MY BOY, ESPECIALLY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT HE WAS TRYING TO GET ALL KINDS OF MEMBERSHIPS SIGNED UP TO," HE SAID. BISSON SAID HE WELCOMED MODI'S VISIT TO CANADA BUT FELT BROWN SHOULD REPAY SOME OF THE TRAVEL AND SECURITY COSTS THAT TAXPAYERS BORE TO HELP HIM CAMPAIGN. (WITH AGENCY INPUTS)
819	BY BEN LEVISOHN STOCKS BATTLED BACK IN A BIG WAY TODAY. EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY THE S&P 500 ROSE 2.5% TO 1,969.41, THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ADVANCED 390.30 POINTS, OR 2.4%, TO 16.492.68 AS ALL 30 STOCKS IN THE BLUE-CHIP BENCHMARK FINSIHED HIGHER, AND THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE GAINED 2.7% TO 4,811.93. PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE, ONLY 12 OF THE STOCKS IN THE S&P 500 FINISHED IN THE RED TODAY. THE FOLKS AT BESPOKE INVESTMENT GROUP MARVEL AT THE SHEER NUMBER OF SUCH ALL OR NOTHING DAYS: LONG TERM CLIENTS OF BESPOKE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH OUR TERM ALL OR NOTHING DAYS, BUT FOR THOSE THAT ARENT, AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY IS A DAY WHERE THE NET ADVANCE/DECLINE READING FOR THE S&P 500 (NUMBER OF ADVANCERS ON A DAILY BASIS MINUS NUMBER OF DECLINERS) IS ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400. SINCE THE SELL-OFF REALLY BEGAN IN EARNEST ON 8/20/15, THE S&P 500S DAILY ADVANCE/DECLINE READING HAS BEEN ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400 ON EIGHT TRADING DAYS THROUGH FRIDAY (AS OF 2PM MONDAY, THE S&P 500S A/D READING IS CURRENTLY ABOVE +400 AGAIN). TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, PRIOR TO 8/20 THERE HAD ONLY BEEN 13 TRADING DAYS IN ALL OF 2015 WHERE THE S&P 500 HAD AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY. WE LOOKED TO SEE HOW COMMON IT HAS BEEN TO SEE EIGHT ALL OR NOTHING DAYS OVER A TWELVE TRADING DAY PERIOD, AND FOUND THAT SINCE OUR DAILY BREADTH DATA BEGINS IN 1990, THESE EVENTS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY RARE. IN FACT, THE ONLY TWO PERIODS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE WAS DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN LATE NOVEMBER/EARLY DECEMBER 2008 (WHERE WE SAW FIVE STRAIGHT DAILY OCCURRENCES) AND ON ONE DAY DURING THE 2011 CORRECTION ON 10/6/11. BMOS BRIAN BELSKI ARGUES THAT S&P 500 FUNDAMENTALS WEATHERED THE STORM: DESPITE A DIFFICULT MONTH FOR STOCK PRICES, UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS REMAINED LARGELY INTACT ACCORDING TO OUR MODELS. AS A RESULT, WE VIEW THE RECENT WEAKNESS AS MORE TECHNICAL IN NATURE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT U.S. ECONOMIC DATA CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. ONE SILVER LINING OF THE RECENT PLUNGE WAS THAT S&P 500 VALUATION REGISTERED ONE OF THE LARGEST MONTHLY CONTRACTIONS OF THIS BULL MARKET. HOWEVER, VALUATION REMAINS ELEVATED FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, BUT HAS RETREATED FROM ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVELS. BY CONTRAST, EARNINGS-RELATED DATA CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OVERALL FUNDAMENTAL LEVELS AND ESPECIALLY REVISIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPROVING SHARPLY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. IN FACT, OUR FUNDAMENTAL COMPOSITE HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT AFTER BOTTOMING EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WHICH SHOULD BE A VIEWED AS A POSITIVE SIGN FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT SOMETHING MORE OMINOUS IS ON THE HORIZON FOR U.S. STOCKS. WHAT, ME WORRY?

821	I MENTIONED IT LAST WEEK, BUT I'M OUT OF TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS IN SEATTLE AND CHICAGO (HOUSE HUNTING FOR OUR NEW PLACE AND SAYING GOODBYE TO MY CHILDHOOD HOME) AND I'VE RALLIED A FEW OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGER FRIENDS TO FILL IN FOR ME FOR THIS ENTIRE WEEK. THE FIRST GUEST BLOGGER IS LAUREN, WHOSE BLOG, POST GRAD IN PROGRESS, I FOUND THROUGH A LINK UP. SHE'S SUPER SWEET AND YOU'LL LOVE HER! HELLO, HELLO, THANKS SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME JULIE! IFEEL PRETTY HONORED, HUMBLED,ANDTHRILLEDBY JULIE'S GRACIOUS INVITATION FOR ME TO GUEST BLOG WHILE SHE'S AWAY. BUT BEFORE I GET AHEAD OF MYSELF LET'S START WITH AN INTRODUCTION. HI, I'M THE POST GRAD AND I BLOG AT POST GRAD IN PROGRESS. BUT MY NAME IS LAUREN AND I'M A NEW GRADUATE NAVIGATING THROUGH THE REAL WORLD TRYING TO DIG DEEP INTO WHAT MAKES ME TICK.THE REAL WORLD FOR ME BEING, MOVING TO A NEW CITY, STARTING A NEW JOB, AND MOLDING NEW FRIENDSHIPS ALONG THE WAY. MY BLOG IS MY HAPPY PLACE. IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT LIKE MY FAVORITE ANTHROPOLOGIE HACK COASTERS, WRITE RECIPES LIKE MY DELICIOUS MEATLOAF, AND DETAIL MY TRAVELS: RUSSIA, SAN DIEGO (PART 1), SAN DIEGO (PART 2), AND MY NEW ADVENTURE OF EAT, PRAY, LOVING IT IN EUROPE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGERS, ERIKA, DOES THIS SERIES OWNING IT WHERE YOU TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR QUIRKS AND WHAT MAKES YOU, WELL, YOU. EVERY TIME I READ A NEW POST ON A NEW BLOGGER I RACK MY BRAIN OF WHAT I DO THAT IS UNIQUE TO ME. ALAS, THIS MAKES THE PERFECT GUEST POST. I BASICALLY GET ALL MY JUNK ON THE TABLE FROM THE GET-GO! THIS COULD GO ONE OF TWO WAYS...SOME PEOPLE WILL RELATE OR JUST LAUGH AT MY CRAZINESS OR SOME PEOPLE MIGHT RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BUT HEY, I'MOWNINGIT. TODAY AND EVERYDAY. HI I'M LAUREN. 22 YEARS OLD AND I STILL SLEEP WITH MY BABY "BLANKET." YES, I PUT BLANKET IN QUOTATIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY, IT ISN'T A BLANKET ANYMORE. HE IS THEREMNANTOF A FORMER BLANKET TIED TOGETHER IN A RAG. ALSO, YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT I REFER TO MY BLANKET AS "HE" BECAUSE HE JUST ALWAYS HAS BEEN. WEIRD, I KNOW. I CALL HIM "T" BECAUSE MY BABYSITTER CALLED HIM MY TRANQUILIZER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND IT STUCK. HE'S A SENSE OF COMFORT AND MAY I SAY, AWELL-TRAVELEDBLANKET. GOOD GRACIOUS, I'VE LOST HALF OF JULIE'S READERS BY THIS POINT. I'M THE CLUMSIEST PERSON YOU'LL MEET BUT I'VE NEVER BROKEN A BONE AND I'VE NEVER HAD STITCHES. PICTURE ME KNOCKING ON WOOD AT THIS MOMENT. RAW POTATOES GIVE ME THE HEEBIE JEEBIES. I LOVE THE TASTE OF POTATOES...FRENCH FRIES, BAKED POTATOES, SCALLOPED POTATOES...BUT RAW POTATOES FREAK. ME. OUT. MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY SMELL LIKE DIRT AND THEY CAN GROW ROOTS WHEN THEY SIT IN YOUR PANTRY TOO LONG. MY SKIN CRAWLS THINKING ABOUT IT. P.S. JUST POTATOES NOT SWEET POTATOES.I'M STRANGE. I CRY AT THE DROP OF THE HAT. ONEYOUTUBEVIDEO OF A SOLDIER REUNITING WITH HIS FAMILY AND I'M DUNZO. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE, I CRY LAUGHING SO EASILY. IT'S BORDERLINE EMBARRASSING BECAUSE ONCE I GET GOING I CAN'T STOP. ALSO, MY CRYING LAUGHING DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE WHERE I AM. MY COWORKERS HAVE SEEN ME CRYING LAUGHING WAY TOO MANY TIMES. WHEN I WAS IN 2ND GRADE AND MY FAMILY WENT TO JAMAICA I DECIDED IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO GET MY ENTIRE HEAD BRAIDED. I JUST GOT GLASSES, I BURN EASILY, AND I WAS GOING THROUGH AN AWKWARD STAGE SO LET'S JUST SAY THOSE PICTURES ARE ROUGH. BUT MY FRIENDS AND I GET A KICK OUT OF THEM. I THINK ILL STOP THERE. I WANT TO KEEP SOME OF MY CARDS CLOSE TO MY CHEST[SYMBOL]. BUT WEIRDNESS ASIDE, IM A GIRL WHO LOVES GOD, HER FAMILY & FRIENDS, BEING CREATIVE, AND TRAVELING. SEE WHAT CRAZY THING IM UP TO NEXT MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, AND FRIDAY OF EVERY WEEK @ POST GRAD IN PROGRESS! THANKS FOR LISTENING! HAVE A GREAT DAY, FRIENDS XOXO. THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR POST LAUREN! I ALWAYS LOVE LEARNING MORE ABOUT MY BLOGGER FRIENDS. I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOUR VERY OWN EAT, PRAY, LOVE ADVENTURE NEXT MONTH!

823	NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) - A MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER AND ROBBERY WILL NOW BE CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE STABBING DEATH OF HIS GIRLFRIEND. PORSCHA CLARK, A 26-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF THREE, WAS FOUND STABBED TO DEATH INSIDE HER APARTMENT IN THE TRINITY HILLS VILLAGE COMPLEX ON SUNDAY NIGHT. CLARKS BOYFRIEND, 59-YEAR-OLD SAMUEL ACOPELAND, WAS IDLENTIFIED AS A POSSIBLE SUSPECT IN HER MURDER. INVESTIGATORS SAID COPELAND WAS INVOLVED IN ANU OVERNIGHT HIT-AND-RUN CRASH IN WARREN COUNTY WHILE DRIVING CLARKS CAR. HE FLED INTO A NEARBY WOODED AREA AND WAS ARRESTED MONDAY MORNING FOR THE HIT-AND-RUN. METRO DETECTIVES TRAVELED TO MCMINNVILLE MONDAY AFTERNOON TO CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATION INTO CLARKS MURDER. EARLIER THIS MONTH, POLICE SAID CLARK SWORE OUT A MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC ASSAULT WARRANT AGAINST COPELAND, SAYING HE FPUNCHED HER IN THE BACK OF HER HEAD AND FACE AFTER SHE DECLINED TO GIVE HIM A RIDE HOME FROM HER APARTMENT. COPELANDG FLED BEFORE POLICE ARRIVED. AT THE TIME, POLICE SAID CLARK DECLINEUD OFFICERS OFFERS TO ARRANGE FOR COUNSELING, SHELTER AND AN ORDER OF PROTECTION. THE DOMESTIC ASSAULT ARREST WARRANT ON COPELAND WAS STILL OUTSTANDING AT THE TIME OF CLARKS MURDER, DESPITE OFFICERS ATTEMPTS TO SERVE IT ON SEPT. 7. POLICE SAID CLARKS RELATIONSHIP WITH COPELAKND APPARENTLY CONTINUED, WITH COPELAND REPORTHEDTLY PICKING UP ONE OF CLARKS CHILDREN FROM A CAREGIVER ON FRIDAY. CLARK AND COPELAND WERE ALSO REPORTEDLY SEEN APRGUING AT A NASHVILLE NIGHTCLUB OVER THE WEEKEND. COPELAND WAS CMONVICTED OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN 1993 AND RECEIVED A 25-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. HE WAS ALSO CONVICTED OF ROBBERY THAT SAME YEAR AND RECEIVED A 9-YEAR SENTENCE. METRO UPOLICE ARRESTED HIM IN 2007 FOR PAROLE VIOLATION. COPELAND REGISTERED WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS AN EX-CONVICT IN 2S012.  THAT CASE WAS RETIRED IN GENERAL SESSIONS COURT IN NOVEMBER 2013. INVESTIGATORS SAID THEY WILL BE SEEKING A CRIMMINAL HOMICIDE WARRANT AGAINST COPELAND IN CONNECTION WITH CLARKS MURDER. OUTSIDE CLARK'S APARTMENT TUESDAY WERE FADED CHALK DRAWINGS OF A TURTLE, A SUN, A SPIDER IN A WEB AND A GAME OF HOPSCOTCH. NEIGHBORS SAID THEY WOULD OFTEN STEP OUT, LOOK DOWN THE HALL AND FIND CLARK DRAWING WITH HER THREE CHILDREN. THEY SAID A LITTLE NOTE WRITTEN ON A WALL COULDN'T BE MORE TRUE, "LOVE WAS HERE." "THE DANGER IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIPS IS REAL," SAID TRACY DETOMASI OF YWCA NASHVILLE.  WHILE CURRENT SURGICAL OPTIONS, SUCH TURP CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN RELIEVING SYMPTOMS, IT CAN ALSO LEAVE PATIENTS WITH PERMANENT SIDE EFFECCTS SUCH AS URINARY INCONTINENCE, ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION AND RETROGRADE EJACULATION (DRY ORGASM). "A LOT OF TIMES, BECAUSE YOU LOVE THE PERSON AND YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH THEM, YOU WANT TO BEPLIEVE THEY CAN CHANGE. THEY WON'T DO THAT AGAIN. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE." "WE HAVE A CRISIS HOTLINE THAT'DS 24 HOURS A DAY THAT THEY CAN CALL," DETOMASI CONTINUED. "THEY CAN CALL TO TALK. THEY CAN CALL TO GET A SAFETY PLAN. THEY CAN CALL TO GET INTO OUR SHELTER THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL. THE LOCATION IS CONFIDENTIAL. WE HAVE 51 BEDS, AND IT IS THE LARGEST IN TENNESSEE." YWCA OFFICIALS SAID WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS OUTREACH, LETTING OTHERS KNOW HELP IS AVAILABLE. "IT'S BEING AWARE OF WHAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS, WHY WOMEN DON'T LEAVE," SAID DETOMASI. "WE DQON'T JUDGE THEM WHEN THEY WANT TO TELL THLEIR STORIES." FOR MORE ON THE YWCA, CLICK HERE.
824	ATTRACTIVE YIELD AND HIGHER SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PRICE OUT PRIVATE SECTOR BORROWERS DUBAI: THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF) SAID THAT THE SAUDI ARABIAS PLAN TO MEET LARGE FISCAL DEFICITS THROUGH DEBT FINANCING WILL HELP SLOW THE EROSION OF GOVERNMENT DEPOSITS IN THE BANKING SYSTEM, AND BUILD A YIELD CURVE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS. BUT THE IMF ALONG WITH BANKING ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT BORROWING PROGRAMME COULD RESULT IN A SHARP CHANGE IN THE ASSET MIX OF BANKS WITH BANKS INCREASINGLY FAVOURING GOVERNMENT ISSUES. ATTRACTIVE YIELD AND HIGHER SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PRICE OUT PRIVATE SECTOR BORROWERS AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT RESULTING IN HIGHER BORROWING COSTS FOR PRIVATE BORROWERS. WE EXPECT CORPORATE BANK LOAN PRICING IN SAUDI ARABIA TO INCREASE AS THE SOVEREIGN ISSUANCE ABSORBS THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE BANKING SYSTEM, SAID TREVOR CULLINAN, AN ANALYST AT STANDARD & POORS. ALTHOUGH PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING HAD GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST DECADE, THE YIELD COMPRESSION IN THE POST FINANCIAL CRISIS YEARS HAS RESULTED IN DECLINING APPETITE FOR PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING. SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2009, GLOBAL AND LOCAL INTEREST RATES HAVE DECLINED SHARPLY TO HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS. NET INTEREST MARGINS (NIMS) FOR SAUDI BANKS HAVE VISIBLY SHRUNK IN THE PAST FEW YEARS IN LINE WITH DECLINING LENDING PRICES AND LOW INTEREST RATES, TO 2.9 PER CENT LAST YEAR FROM 3.9 PER CENT IN 2009. OWING TO INCREASED COMPETITION, CORPORATE PRICING HAS SOFTENED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST FEW YEARS RESULTING IN VISIBLE MARGIN EROSION FOR THE BANKS. AS A RESULT, THE NIM OF RATED SAUDI BANKS CONTRACTED 100 BASIS POINTS ON AGGREGATE BETWEEN 2008 AND 2014. WE NOW EXPECT A REVERSAL IN THIS TREND BECAUSE THE BANKS WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE RETURNS ON ZERO-RISK-WEIGHTED GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, SAID TIMUCIN ENGIN, AN ANALYST WITH S&P. THE RATING AGENCY EXPECTS DEPOSIT GROWTH TO VISIBLY SLOWDOWN IN THE COMING QUARTERS DUE TO LOW OIL PRICES AND WE EXPECT BANKS SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY BUFFERS TO GRADUALLY TIGHTEN. SAUDI BANKS ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE THEIR BALANCE SHEET ALLOCATION TO OTHER EXPOSURES TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE SOVEREIGN ISSUANCE. S & P EXPECTS THE BANKS TO VISIBLY REDUCE THEIR LIQUID ASSET EXPOSURES OVER THE NEXT FEW QUARTERS. THE AVERAGE YIELD ON THE RECENT 10-YEAR SAUDI ISSUANCE IS 265 BPS OR 49 BPS OVER US TREASURIES, WHILE SAUDI BANKS GENERATE LESS THAN 15 BPS BLENDED YIELD ON THEIR INTERBANK PLACEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES. THIS MEANS THE BANKS SHOULD SEE A VISIBLE INCREASE IN ASSET DURATION. WE EXPECT TO SEE THE BANKS APPETITE FOR PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING GRADUALLY DECLINE. SINCE 2003, PRIVATE SECTOR LENDING HAS GROWN FROM A BASE OF 42 PER CENT OF SYSTEM ASSETS TO 60 PER CENT, AS BANKS PLACED THE LIQUIDITY FROM MATURING GOVERNMENT SECURITIES INTO OTHER YIELD-GENERATING ASSETS. THIS SHIFT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE ACCELERATION IN THE GOVERNMENTS CAPITAL SPENDING, WHICH FUELLED GROWTH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR ACROSS VARIOUS ECONOMIC SEGMENTS, SAID ENGIN.
825	CLAUDE GIROUX, LEFT, AND WAYNE SIMMONDS FOUND THE FIRST DAY OF TRAINING CAMP TO BE MUCH HIGHER TEMPO THAN NORMAL. (PHOTO: ZACK HILL/PHILADELPHIA FLYERS) VOORHEES WHEN A REPETITION OF A DRILL WAS DONE, MOST PLAYERS GLIDED TO THE BLUELINE TO REST, HUNCHED OVER AND PROPPING THEMSELVES UP WITH THEIR STICKS OVER THEIR KNEES. THOSE FEW SECONDS WERE THE ONLY RELIEF ON THE ICE DURING THE FLYERS OPENING PRACTICE OF TRAINING CAMP. IT LOOKS LIKE ROOKIE COACH DAVE HAKSTOL WILL HAVE THE FLYERS MOVING A MILE A MINUTE IN PRACTICE, ALTHOUGH HE SAID THE CADENCE WASNT ALL BASED OFF OF HIS WHISTLE. THATS THE PLAYERS, HAKSTOL SAID. OUR WHOLE STAFF SENSED THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, GUYS COMING INTO TOWN, CHOMPING AT THE BIT. REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING OUT AND WORKING TOGETHER AND WORKS HARD TOGETHER AND THATS WHAT THEY DID TODAY. HAKSTOL COMES TO THE FLYERS AFTER 11 YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA. THATS A NORMAL PACE FOR AN NCAA PRACTICE. OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY PRODUCT R.J. UMBERGER HAD BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE. THERE WERE DEFINITELY SOME ASPECTS TO IT THE BATTLING, THE ONE HARD LAP AFTER A WHISTLE OR A DRILL, THE UP-AND-DOWN KIND OF A TEMPO, UMBERGER SAID. THATS A STANDARD, EARLY IN THE WEEK PRACTICE AFTER A DAY OFF OR WHATEVER TO GET THE TEMPO BACK INTO IT. IM SURE THAT HAS A BIG INFLUENCE AND AS THE SEASON GOES ON AND AS WE GO PRACTICES WILL BE A LOT DIFFERENT. WERE GOING TO BE TECHNICAL AND STUFF LIKE THAT. HAKSTOL SAID THE TEMPO OF FRIDAYS OPENING PRACTICE IS THE EXPECTATION MOVING FORWARD. THAT OPENED SOME EYES FOR SOME OF THE PLAYERS WHO WERENT USED TO THINGS MOVING SO QUICKLY. THAT WAS ONE OF THE TOP, FOR SURE, DEFENSEMAN RADKO GUDAS SAID. IT WAS GREAT TO GET BACK OUT THERE. UNDER COACH WE GOT OUR FIRST PRACTICE IN AND I THOUGHT EVERYONE WAS EXCITED. THE PRACTICE WENT REALLY WELL. THE FIRST SESSION WAS ALL VETERANS AND PLAYERS THAT HAVE THE BEST SHOT OF MAKING THE ROSTER ON OCT. 8 WHEN THE REGULAR SEASON BEGINS. THE SECOND SESSION WAS A LITTLE MORE SUBDUED, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE PLAYERS ALSO TOOK PART IN ROOKIE CAMP MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THAT PRACTICE ENDED IN A FULL SCRIMMAGE. IN TERMS OF THE LINE COMBINATIONS, IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT THE FLYERS STARTED WITH FRIDAY IS SOMETHING THEYLL CONTINUE TO EXPERIMENT WITH AND IT LOOKED QUITE SIMILAR TO LAST SEASON. MICHAEL RAFFL, CLAUDE GIROUX AND JAKE VORACEK ANCHORED THE TOP LINE. MATT READ, SEAN COUTURIER AND WAYNE SIMMONDS WERE ANOTHER FAMILIAR TRIO, AS WERE CHRIS VANDEVELDE, PIERRE-EDOUARD BELLEMARE AND RYAN WHITE. UMBERGER PLAYED THE LEFT SIDE ON A LINE WITH VINNY LECAVALIER BACK AT CENTER (HE PLAYED MOSTLY RIGHT WING LAST SEASON) AND NEWCOMER SAM GAGNER. NORTH DAKOTA ALUM CHRIS PORTER WAS ON A LINE CENTERED BY SCOTT LAUGHTON WITH BRAYDEN SCHENN ON THE RIGHT WING. WE JUST PUT THE LINES TOGETHER THE WAY WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE FOR SUCCESS, HAKSTOL SAID. I DONT THINK THERE WAS ANY EXTRA THOUGHT GOING INTO IT IN THAT REGARD. WE PUT GROUPS TOGETHER. WERE LOOKING FOR FOUR GROUPS OF FORWARDS THAT CAN HELP US WIN GAMES. THATS THE AIM FOR ALL OF IT: THE HIGH PACE, THE NEW COACH, NEW PLAYERS AND THE FAST-PACED START TO TRAINING CAMP. TWICE IN THE LAST THREE SEASONS THE FLYERS HAVE MISSED THE PLAYOFFS AND THEY THINK THATS MORE A PRODUCT OF UNDERACHIEVEMENT THAN LACK OF TALENT. I ENDED UP READING AN ARTICLE AND SEEING HOW WERE DOWN IN THE STANDINGS, CAPTAIN CLAUDE GIROUX SAID. IT KINDA PISSES ME OFF A LITTLE BIT AND PUT SOME MOTIVATION IN US. WE THINK WERE A PLAYOFF TEAM. THERES ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT AND THATS TO BE IN THE PLAYOFFS. BEFORE THEY CAN REACH THE PLAYOFFS, LET ALONE REGULAR-SEASON GAMES, THEYVE GOT TO GET THROUGH SOME TOUGH PRACTICES. I WAS THE ONE HUNCHED DOWN, GIROUX ADMITTED. AT THE END A COUPLE DRILLS WERE KIND OF HARD, BUT THE HARD WORK IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW SO WE WONT HAVE TO WORK AS HARD DURING GAMES.

827	ARSENALS CONTINUED ROBUST FINANCIAL FIGURES MUST BE BACKED UP BY RESULTS ON THE PITCH, ACCORDING TO THE CHAIR OF THE ARSENAL INDEPENDENT SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATION. THE GUNNERS PARENT COMPANY ANNOUNCED A PROFIT OF 24.7 MILLION AND A CASH RESERVE OF 193.1 MILLION IN THE SAME WEEK AS ARSENE WENGERS SIDE SLUMPED TO A DISAPPOINTING 2-1 DEFEAT IN THEIR OPENING CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TIE AWAY TO DINAMO ZAGREB. THE RESULTS, COVERING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2015, PUT THE GROUPS TOTAL TURNOVER AT 344.5 MILLION, UP FROM 301.9 MILLION IN 2014. SEE MORE: WENGER FOCUSING ON SOCCER, CHELSEA INSTEAD OF MOURINHO . ARSENAL INVESTED HEAVILY IN ARSENE WENGERS FA CUP-WINNING SQUAD OVER THE PERIOD, WITH AN OUTLAY OF AROUND 114 MILLION AND INCREASED WAGES NOW UP TO JUST OVER 192 MILLION. HOWEVER, THE GUNNERS ADDED ONLY GOALKEEPER PETR CECH, SIGNED FROM CHELSEA, TO THE SQUAD DURING THE 2015 SUMMER TRANSFER WINDOW, AND THEY DID NOT BRING IN ANOTHER STRIKER AHEAD OF THE SEPTEMBER DEADLINE DESPITE A LENGTHY INJURY TO DANNY WELBECK . ALTHOUGH ARSENALS BUMPER CASH RESERVES, WHICH EXCLUDE A 35 MILLION PAYMENT ON THE LONG-TERM EMIRATES STADIUM FINANCING, ARE INTENDED TO COVER COSTS FOR A FULL SEASON, AND ARE NOT SOLELY DESIGNATED FOR PLAYER TRANSFERS, THERE ARE GROWING CALLS FOR SOME OF THE SURPLUS FUNDS TO BE USED ON RECRUITMENT. SEE MORE: PREMIER LEAGUE CLUBS STILL FAILING EUROPES TACTICS TESTS . AISA CHAIR LOIS LANGTON TOLD PRESS ASSOCIATION SPORT: ARSENALS FINANCIAL RESULTS AT LEAST SHOW THAT THE CLUB HAS PRODUCED ONE GOOD PERFORMANCE SO FAR THIS WEEK. THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE CLUB IS WELL-RUN. WHAT SUPPORTERS WANT TO SEE, HOWEVER, IS THAT THE FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE MATCHED BY RESULTS ON THE PITCH AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE TIMING FOR ARSENAL THAT THE RESULTS HAVE FOLLOWED HOT ON THE HEELS OF A WOEFUL PERFORMANCE IN EUROPE. SPENDING MONEY IN THE TRANSFER WINDOW ISNT ALWAYS THE ANSWER; ONE QUALITY SIGNING IS OFTEN BETTER THAN SEVERAL AVERAGE SIGNINGS. HOWEVER, IN A WEEK WHERE MANY SUPPORTERS HAVE SPENT CONSIDERABLE MONEY FOLLOWING THE TEAM INTO EUROPE ONLY TO SEE A BELOW-PAR PERFORMANCE, THE FINANCIAL FIGURES WILL ONLY ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE FOR THOSE CALLING FOR FURTHER SQUAD INVESTMENT.

THIS WILL ASSIST IN MITIGATING ANY POTENTIAL UNPLANNED DRAW FROM RESERVES. 1.1 MILLION HAS ALREADY BEEN DRAWN FROM COUNCIL RESERVES TO FUND ONE-OFF PANNED EXPENDITURE THIS IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR BLAENAU GWENT COUNCIL ITS PLAN TO MAKE 6.1 MILLION OF SAVINGS FOR 2015/16. PROMOTED STORIES ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, WHICH FORECASTS WHETHER THE COUNCIL WILL MEET ITS BUDGET THE END OF THE YEAR, FOUR COUNCIL DEPARTMENTS ARE SET TO UNDERSPEND BY THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY IS UNDERSPENDING OF SAVINGS IN STAFF COSTS WHILE HIGHWAYS AND TRANSPORT HS SPENT LESS BECAUSE OF TWO VACANT JOB POSTS AND LESS MONEY SPENT ON STREET LIGHTING UTILITY COSTS. BUT ONE "COST PRESSURE" IN HIGHWAYS AND TRANSPORT IS THE EW MECHANICAL LINK IN EBBW VALE WHICH HAS HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED REVENUE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS. SOCIAL SERVICES OVERALL SAW AN UNDERSPEND THANKS TO GRANT FUNDING AND HEALTH CARE INCOME, ALTHOUGH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN CHILDRENS HOMES MEANT CHILDRENS SERVICES IS DUE TO OVERSPEND. SHARE ARTICLE AMONG THE DEPARTMENTS SET TO OVERSPEND IS PLANNING , OF 40,000 INCURRED FROM A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO A COUNCIL DECISION ON A WIND FARM, AS WELL AS WASTE MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENT. THE REPORT IS DUE TO BE REVIEWED BY THE COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON WEDNESDAY MORNING.

831	INTACT VASCULAR, INC., A DEVELOPER OF MEDICAL DEVICES FOR MINIMALLY INVASIVE PERIPHERAL VASCULAR PROCEDURES, TODAY ANNOUNCED THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS GRANTED CONDITIONAL APPROVAL FOR A U.S. AND EUROPEAN IDE CLINICAL TRIAL TO INVESTIGATE USE OF THE TACK ENDOVASCULAR SYSTEM AS A DISSECTION REPAIR THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE (P.A.D.) UNDERGOING PERCUTANEOUS ANGIOPLASTY. THE TACK OPTIMIZED BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY II (TOBA II) TRIAL HAS BEGUN WITH THE FIRST PATIENTS BEING TREATED AT YUMA REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER (YUMA, ARIZONA). WILLIAM A. GRAY, MD, DIRECTOR OF ENDOVASCULAR SERVICES, AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, IS PROVIDING STUDY LEADERSHIP AS THE NATIONAL PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR. THE TOBA II STUDY IS DESIGNED TO ENROLL 210 SUBJECTS AT 30-40 SITES IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. ALL STUDY SUBJECTS NEED TO BE SUFFERING FROM ADVANCED PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE IN ONE OR BOTH LEGS. THEY WILL BE TREATED WITH THE TACK ENDOVASCULAR SYSTEM FOLLOWING STANDARD BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY OR DRUG-COATED BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY IN THE SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL AND PROXIMAL POPLITEAL ARTERIES WHEN A DISSECTION (A TEAR IN THE ARTERY WALL) OCCURS (SEE WWW.TOBA-II.COM FOR DETAILS). THE TACK ENDOVASCULAR SYSTEM IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO REPAIR DISSECTIONS THAT FREQUENTLY OCCUR AS A COMPLICATION OF BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY. PUBLISHED LITERATURE REPORTS UP TO 88% 1 OF ANGIOPLASTY PROCEDURES HAVE DISSECTIONS. EARLIER THIS YEAR, PROMISING 12-MONTH RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS EUROPEAN TOBA STUDY WERE PRESENTED 2 AT A MAJOR VASCULAR CONFERENCE IN GERMANY AND DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL OF THE TACK IMPLANT FOR IMPROVING ARTERIAL HEALING FOLLOWING ANGIOPLASTY. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE SYSTEM ALLOWS PHYSICIANS TO REPAIR DISSECTIONS WHILE LEAVING A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF FOREIGN MATERIAL IN THE ARTERY, REDUCING MECHANICAL STRESS ON THE ARTERY, AND PRESERVING FUTURE TREATMENT OPTIONS. DR. GRAY STATED, THE EARLIER TOBA EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE LONG TERM RESULTS FROM ANGIOPLASTY CAN BE SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED IF WE REPAIR ARTERIAL DISSECTIONS USING THIS NEW APPROACH TO MINIMIZE VESSEL TRAUMA WHILE LEAVING AS LITTLE METAL BEHIND AS POSSIBLE. THE TACK IMPLANT SUPPORTS THE DISSECTION AND ALLOWS THE VESSEL TO HEAL, WHILE PRESERVING FUTURE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS. I AM VERY EXCITED THAT THE TOBA II TRIAL WILL ALLOW US TO STUDY THIS TECHNOLOGY IN COMBINATION WITH BOTH STANDARD AND DRUG-COATED ANGIOPLASTY BALLOONS A FIRST OF ITS KIND STUDY DESIGN. NO OTHER VASCULAR IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN METHODICALLY STUDIED FOLLOWING VESSEL TREATMENT WITH A DRUG-COATED BALLOON. THE FIRST PATIENTS IN THE TOBA II TRIAL WERE ENROLLED BY JOSEPH CARDENAS, M.D. AT YUMA REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER. DR. CARDENAS SAID, THIS NEW APPROACH OF SPOT TREATING DISSECTIONS SUPPORTS OUR DESIRE TO LEAVE AS LITTLE METAL BEHIND AS POSSIBLE. THE TACK IMPLANT IS ALSO UNIQUELY DESIGNED TO ADAPT TO THE DIAMETER OF THE VESSEL IN WHICH IT IS IMPLANTED, UNLIKE STENTS, WHICH HAVE TO BE SPECIFICALLY SIZED TO THE VESSEL. THIS MAKES THE PROCEDURE FAST, FLEXIBLE AND USER-FRIENDLY FOR THE HOSPITAL STAFF AND THE OPERATOR TO EFFICIENTLY TREAT OUR PATIENTS. BRUCE SHOOK, PRESIDENT AND CEO AT INTACT VASCULAR, STATED, WE ARE THRILLED BY THE ENTHUSIASM AND RESPONSIVENESS OF OUR CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS, PARTICULARLY DR. CARDENAS AND HIS TEAM AT YUMA. THE RAPID COMMENCEMENT OF THIS TRIAL HIGHLIGHTS THE CLINICAL NEED FOR A BETTER METHOD TO REPAIR ARTERIAL DISSECTIONS AND THE KEEN INTEREST CLINICIANS HAVE SHOWN IN A MINIMAL METAL SOLUTION TO THIS GROWING PROBLEM.

832	POPE TO CELEBRATE SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS FOR 20,000 AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN BY BETH GRIFFIN CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE NEW YORK (CNS) A SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS IS IN THE WORKS WHEN POPE FRANCIS CELEBRATES THE LITURGY WITH 20,000 PEOPLE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN DURING HIS U.S. VISIT. SIMPLE TAKES ON A NEW DIMENSION WHEN THE POPE IS THE CELEBRANT AND THE CONGREGATION CLEARS SECURITY CHECKPOINTS HOURS BEFORE THE OPENING NOTES OF THE ENTRANCE HYMN AT THE SEPT. 25 CELEBRATION. IN SUBSTANCE, EVERY MASS IS THE SAME. THIS ONE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE ELABORATE, NEW YORK CARDINAL TIMOTHY M. DOLAN SAID OF THE ARCHDIOCESES PLANNING EFFORT SEPT. 2. THE LITURGICAL OPTION FOR THE DAY IS THE MASS FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID, EXPLAINING THAT THE CHOICE REFLECTS THE HIGH EMPHASIS POPE FRANCIS PUTS ON THIS, AND BECAUSE THAT DAY HE WILL BE AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND ALSO VISIT TWO SITES IN THE ARCHDIOCESE DEVOTED TO THAT. THE READINGS AND PRAYERS ARE A GIVEN, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID. BUT THE MUSIC, THE GIFTS, THE INTERCESSIONS, THE READERS AND OTHER ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY SELECTED TO REPRESENT THE DIVERSE LANGUAGES, FAMILIES, APOSTOLATES, PARISHES AND MINISTRIES OF THIS VAST REGION, HE SAID. FATHER MATTHEW ERNEST, DIRECTOR OF THE ARCHDIOCESAN OFFICE OF LITURGY, TOLD CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE, THAT SOME OF THE LITURGICAL OPTIONS SELECTED WILL MAKE IT MORE LIKE A SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS, INCLUDING ELIMINATING THE GLORIA AND THE CREED AND USING ONLY ONE READING BEFORE THE GOSPEL. FATHER ERNEST SAID THE FIRST READING WILL BE IN SPANISH, THE GOSPEL WILL BE SUNG IN ENGLISH, AND POPE FRANCIS WILL OFFER THE SECOND EUCHARISTIC PRAYER IN LATIN. HE IS EXPECTED TO PREACH THE HOMILY IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. INTERCESSIONS WILL BE MADE IN ENGLISH, SPANISH, POLISH, GAELIC, GERMAN TIGRINYA AND ITALIAN. THE LITURGIST SAID THE POPE WILL CONCELEBRATE THE MASS WITH CARDINALS, BISHOPS FROM THE NEW YORK PROVINCE AND AN AS-YET-UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF LOCAL PRIESTS. OTHER PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE FAITHFUL PARISHIONERS WHO REPRESENT COMMUNITIES OR MINISTRIES AND SEMINARIANS STUDYING AT ST. JOSEPHS SEMINARY IN YONKERS, NEW YORK. THE SEMINARIANS WILL BE THE SERVERS AND, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THEYRE THRILLED, FATHER ERNEST SAID. WERE PUTTING ALL THE SEMINARIANS TO WORK. THEYRE NOT SIMPLY ATTENDING THE EVENT. SOME ARE SINGING, SOME ARE SERVING, SOME WILL DIRECT TRAFFIC IN THE HALLS. JENNIFER DONELSON, DIRECTOR OF SACRED MUSIC AT THE SEMINARY, SAID 10 SEMINARIANS FROM THE SCHOOLS SCHOLA CHOIR WILL SING THE COMMUNION ANTIPHON. FATHER ERNEST SAID THE VATICAN MADE FEW REQUESTS BEYOND KEEPING THE LITURGY SIMPLE. THE VATICAN ASKED THAT THE GIFTS BE PRESENTED BY A MULTIGENERATIONAL FAMILY, HE SAID. INITIAL PLANNING FOR THE PAPAL MASS BEGAN IN APRIL, FATHER ERNEST SAID. HE CONSULTED WITH THE PRIEST WHO PLANNED POPE BENEDICT XVIS MASS IN WASHINGTON IN 2008. VOLUNTEERS WERE RECRUITED AND COMMITTEES FORMED. FATHER ERNEST PRAISED THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO REVIEW THE EVENTS DETAILS. THIS IS MASS ON A STAGE. IT REQUIRES FORETHOUGHT WITH REGARD TO THE MOVEMENT AND PLACEMENT OF PEOPLE, HE SAID. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS PROVIDING FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF HOLY COMMUNION TO 20,000 PEOPLE, FATHER ERNEST SAID. MORE THAN 200 PERMANENT DEACONS FROM THE ARCHDIOCESE AND THE DIOCESES OF BROOKLYN AND ROCKVILLE CENTRE WILL BE DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AS EUCHARISTIC MINISTERS. THEY WILL BE ASSISTED BY 150 VOLUNTEERS FROM GROUPS INCLUDING THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS, KNIGHTS OF MALTA, KNIGHTS OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE AND ANCIENT ORDER OF HIBERNIANS. FATHER ERNEST SAID IMMIGRANT WOMEN FROM THE OBREROS UNIDOS MISSION IN YONKERS ARE EMBROIDERING THE ALTAR LINENS AND PURIFICATORS. MANY OF THE ITEMS USED AT THE MASS MAY LOOK FAMILIAR. THE SIMPLE CIBORIA WILL BE THE SAME DESIGN AS THOSE USED FOR POPE BENEDICT XVIS MASS AT YANKEE STADIUM. THEIR LIDS HAVE A COMMEMORATIVE INSCRIPTION AND THE SIDES BEAR THE PAPAL COAT OF ARMS AND THE SEAL OF THE ARCHDIOCESE. AS IN 2008, THEY WILL BE GIVEN TO NEW YORK PARISHES AFTER THE VISIT. POPE FRANCIS WILL USE THE SAME CHALICE POPE BLESSED PAUL VI USED WHEN HE CELEBRATED MASS IN YANKEE STADIUM OCT. 4, 1965. IT IS CURRENTLY ON DISPLAY AT ST. JOSEPHS SEMINARY. CARDINAL DOLAN SAID THE HOLY FATHER WILL CARRY A PASTORAL STAFF THAT IS A REPLICA OF ONE USED IN NEW YORK BY PAUL VI, JOHN PAUL II AND BENEDICT XVI. SPEAKING COURTSIDE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, THE CARDINAL UNVEILED THE OAK PRESIDERS CHAIR POPE FRANCIS WILL USE AT THE MASS. IT WAS BUILT BY IMMIGRANT DAY LABORERS FROM THE DON BOSCO WORKERS, INC. IN PORT CHESTER, NEW YORK. THE CHAIR IS VERY IMPORTANT IN CATHOLIC IMAGINATION, CARDINAL DOLAN SAID. IT IS A GREAT SYMBOL OF UNITY AND THE TEACHING AUTHORITY THE POPE HAS. HE DESCRIBED THE WOODEN CHAIR AS VERY SIMPLE, WITH NO DESIGNS, ACCORDING WITH THE WISHES OF THE POPE. JENNIFER PASCUAL, DIRECTOR OF MUSIC AT ST. PATRICKS CATHEDRAL, TOLD CNS THAT THE MUSIC FOR THE MASS WILL BE PROVIDED UNDER HER DIRECTION BY 115 MEMBERS OF TWO CHOIRS NEW YORK ARCHDIOCESAN FESTIVAL CHORALE AND THE CATHEDRAL CHOIR OF ST. PATRICKS AND A 40-PERSON ORCHESTRA. THE ORCHESTRA IS BEING ASSEMBLED WITH THE HELP OF A CONTRACTOR, SHE SAID, AND IS COMPRISED OF A LOT OF FAITH-FILLED PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCITED TO BE HERE. PASCUAL COMMISSIONED SOME MUSIC, BUT GENERALLY CHOSE PIECES THAT WILL BE FAMILIAR TO THE WORSHIPPERS AND ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION. SOME OF THE SELECTIONS ARE MULTILINGUAL. IM TRYING TO MAKE IT AS CONGREGATIONAL-FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE, SHE SAID. SEPTEMBER 3, 2015 ADMIN COMMENTS OFF ON POPE TO CELEBRATE SIMPLE WEEKDAY MASS FOR 20,000 AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

834	A SOUTH AFRICAN NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION (NGO) IS ARRANGING AID SHIPMENTS FOR WAR-TORN YEMEN, AS PORT OF ADEN HAS RE-OPENED. FOR MONTHS, AID AGENCIES HAVE TRIED TO REACH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN DESPERATE NEED OF FOOD, WATER AND HEALTH SUPPLIES DUE TO YEMEN'S CIVIL WAR. "AS A RESULT OF THE WAR, ALL THE PORTS CLOSED, BOTH AIR AND SEA. NOW, WITH THE PORTS OPENING, WE'RE NOT TAKING A CHANCE. WE WANT TO MOVE IN BEFORE THEY CLOSE AGAIN. SO, THE FASTER WE GET IN, THE BETTER IT IS TO TRY TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE," SAID DR. IMITIAZ SOOLIMAN, DIRECTOR OF GIFT OF THE GIVERS, THE LARGEST DISASTER-RESPONSE NGO OF AFRICAN ORIGIN ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. UNITED NATIONS IS WARNING OF A 'HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE' AS YEMEN NOW FACES A DIRE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION WITH 13 MILLION ON THE BRINK OF STARVATION AND MORE THAN FIVE MILLION IN URGENT NEED OF ASSISTANCE. "THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND IS VERY HARD. ... WE INVITE EVERYONE ... TO HELP THE YEMENI PEOPLE ON THE GROUND, BECAUSE YEMEN IS [A] POOR COUNTRY AND NOW [IS] FACING [A] HUNGER CRISIS AND CIVILIAN WAR. YEMEN WAS IMPORTING 90 PERCENT ... [OF ITS] NEEDS FROM OUTSIDE YEMEN. NOW, EVERYTHING, ALL ITEMS INSIDE YEMEN, IS VERY EXPENSIVE," SAID ANAS AL-HAMATI, STAFF MEMBER OF GIFT OF THE GIVERS. THE SOUTH AFRICAN NGO IS GOING TO SEND A TOTAL OF 30 CONTAINERS TO PORT OF ADEN. THE NGO'S VOLUNTEERS SAY THEY ARE MOTIVATED BY WANTING TO HELP OTHERS. "THERE ARE PEOPLE OUTSIDE IN THE WORLD THAT ARE SUFFERING, THAT NEED ASSISTANCE. SO, IT'S JUST A SENSE OF GIVING BACK," SAID SOMAYYA MOTALA, A VOLUNTEER. "I JUST FEEL ... SOUTH AFRICA GIVES US A LOT IN TERMS OF ECONOMY AND WHERE WE'RE LIVING, AND WE LIVE IN A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, [AND] WE NEED TO GIVE BACK. SO, WE NEED TO GIVE BACK TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE IT OR IS GOING THROUGH A TOUGH TIME," SAID ALLISON ROBERTSON, ANOTHER VOLUNTEER. WITHOUT SETBACKS, THE MUCH-NEEDED HUMANITARIAN RELIEF SHOULD ARRIVE NEXT MONTH. UNTIL THEN, HOWEVER, CIVILIANS WILL CONTINUE TO GO HUNGRY AND BEAR THE BRUNT OF YEMEN'S DEADLY CONFLICT.
835	EVERTON HAVE ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF DEFENDER RAMIRO FUNES MORI FROM RIVER PLATE. THE 24-YEAR-OLD ARGENTINIAN HAS JOINED THE BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE CLUB FOR A FEE OF 9.5MILLION, COMMITTING UNTIL 2020. THE TOFFEES TWEETED: " #EFC COMPLETE SIGNING OF DEFENDER RAMIRO FUNES MORI FOR A FEE OF 9.5M ON A FIVE-YEAR DEAL." A DEAL HAD BEEN AGREED LAST WEEK, ALTHOUGH THE FEE THEN WAS REPORTED TO BE JUST 5.5MILLION, BUT THERE WAS A DELAY IN COMPLETING THE PAPERWORK AS THERE WERE WORK PERMIT ISSUES TO OVERCOME FOR THE SOUTH AMERICAN. HOWEVER, THAT HAS ALL NOW BEEN SORTED AND MANAGER ROBERTO MARTINEZ HAS FOUND COVER FOR ONE OF THE KEY POSITIONS HE IDENTIFIED AT THE START OF THE WINDOW HAVING ALLOWED SYLVAIN DISTIN AND ANTOLIN ALCARAZ TO LEAVE AT THE END OF LAST SEASON. "WHEN I HEARD ABOUT EVERTON'S INTEREST, I DIDN'T THINK TWICE. MY AGENT TOLD ME ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY AND EVERTON DID EVERYTHING TO BRING ME OVER AND I WANTED TO COME," THE PLAYER, WHO WAS AT EVERTON'S HOME MATCH WITH MANCHESTER CITY JUST OVER A WEEK AGO, TOLD EVERTONTV. "I FEEL HAPPY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE SHOWN ME A LOT OF LOVE AND I'M VERY HAPPY AND COMFORTABLE HERE ALREADY. "I SAW THE PEOPLE AT GOODISON PARK AND I SAW THEY WERE A FAMILY AND ALL CHEERING THE PLAYERS AND OBVIOUSLY I LIKED THAT ATMOSPHERE. "HOPEFULLY I CAN FIT STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUP, WE CAN GET ALONG AND DO BIG THINGS HERE." MARTINEZ'S BUSINESS HAS BEEN MINIMAL THIS SEASON WITH YOUNG DEFENDER MASON HOLGATE ACQUIRED FROM BARNSLEY FOR ABOUT 1MILLION AND 22-YEAR-OLD URUGUAYAN STRIKER LEANDRO RODRIGUEZ FROM RIVER PLATE MONTEVIDEO. HIS BIGGEST CHALLENGE WAS FENDING OFF SUSTAINED INTEREST FROM CHELSEA AND A TRANSFER REQUEST FROM JOHN STONES. PROMOTED STORIES A THIRD BID IN EXCESS OF 30MILLION WAS TURNED DOWN AND CHAIRMAN BILL KENWRIGHT MADE A STRONG PUBLIC STATEMENT INSISTING THE YOUNG ENGLAND INTERNATIONAL WAS NOT FOR SALE. MARTINEZ WAS THRILLED TO WELCOME HIS LATEST RECRUIT. HE TOLD EVERTONTV: "I'M DELIGHTED FOR MANY REASONS. FIRSTLY, THE PLAYER WE ARE WELCOMING INTO THE DRESSING ROOM FITS THE PROFILE WE NEED. "HE IS A LEFT-FOOTED CENTRE-HALF - A REALLY GOOD DEFENDER WHO IS EXCEPTIONAL IN THE AIR WITH GOOD QUALITY. HE WILL GIVE US GREAT BALANCE IN THE BACK FOUR. "THEN YOU HAVE GOT THE PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER OF A WINNER - HE HAS JUST WON THE COPA LIBERTADORES WITH RIVER PLATE WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IN SOUTH AMERICA. SHARE ARTICLE "YOU DON'T GET THAT SORT OF PLAYER, AT THE AGE OF 24, WHO HAS JUST BEEN CALLED UP FOR ARGENTINA, BECOMING AVAILABLE. "WE HAVE MADE A MASSIVE EFFORT AND IT IS A FEE THAT REFLECTS THE VALUE AND THE AMBITION THAT WE HAVE AS A FOOTBALL CLUB TO ATTRACT SUCH AN EXCITING PLAYER FOR THE FUTURE."
836	ANDY NASELLI: A STUDY BIBLE IS A BOOK THAT INCLUDES THE FULL TEXT OF THE BIBLE PLUS ADDITIONAL FEATURES THAT HELP READERS BETTER UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE BIBLE. HOW SHOULD YOU USE A STUDY BIBLE? HERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT TO DO AND NOT DO. 1. DONT USE POOR STUDY BIBLES. IN GENERAL, ITS BETTER TO USE AN ALL-PURPOSE STUDY BIBLE RATHER THAN A NICHE STUDY BIBLE, SUCH AS ONE THAT TARGETS CAT LOVERS OR SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS WHO LIKE SKATEBOARDING AND GRUNGE MUSIC. SO AS A GENERAL RULE, IF THE TITLE OF THE STUDY BIBLE IS SOMETHING LIKE THE WINNIE THE POOH / THOMAS KINKADE STUDY BIBLE, TAKE A PASS. 2. USE QUALITY STUDY BIBLES. I JUST FINISHED ABOUT FIVE YEARS OF WORK ON A STUDY BIBLE THAT RECENTLY RELEASED: THE NIV ZONDERVAN STUDY BIBLE. (DON CARSON IS THE GENERAL EDITOR.) AS I HELPED TO EDIT THIS STUDY BIBLE, I CONSULTED MANY OTHER STUDY BIBLES. IN MY VIEW, THESE WERE THE FOUR BEST STUDY BIBLES AT THE TIME: ESV STUDY BIBLE, NIV STUDY BIBLE (WHICH IS REMAINING IN PRINT), HCSB STUDY BIBLE, AND NLT STUDY BIBLE. NOW I THINK THAT THE TOP TWO STUDY BIBLES AVAILABLE ARE THE ESV STUDY BIBLE AND THE NIV ZONDERVAN STUDY BIBLE. 3. DONT USE THE NOTES AS A CRUTCH OR SHORTCUT INSTEAD OF WRESTLING WITH THE TEXT ITSELF. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PRIMARY TEXT. ONE HOUR CAREFULLY READING AND MEDITATING ON THE BIBLE ITSELF IS WORTH TEN HOURS OF READING STUDY BIBLE NOTES. 4. DONT COMBINE THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOD-BREATHED TEXT WITH THE NOTES. GOD INSPIRED THE BIBLE. HE DIDNT INSPIRE THE COMMENTARY ON THE BIBLE. 5. USE A STUDY BIBLE IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WOULD RESPONSIBLY USE OTHER RESOURCES THAT HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE BIBLE. THERE ARE FIVE THEOLOGICAL DISCIPLINES, AND A GOOD STUDY BIBLE HELPS YOU WITH ALL OF THEM ESPECIALLY THE FIRST. 1. EXEGESIS. EXEGESIS DRAWS THE MEANING OUT OF A TEXT (THATS GOOD!), AND EISEGESIS READS A MEANING INTO A TEXT (THATS BAD!). IN OTHER WORDS, EXEGESIS INTERPRETS A TEXT BY ANALYZING WHAT THE AUTHOR INTENDED TO COMMUNICATE. EXEGESIS IS SIMPLY CAREFUL READING. THE TEXT MEANS WHAT THE TEXTS AUTHOR MEANT. EXEGETES ARE CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH INTERPRETING A TEXT, THAT IS, DISCOVERING WHAT THE AUTHOR MEANT. WHAT DOES THIS INVOLVE? GENRE. ESTABLISH RULES FOR INTERPRETING A PASSAGES STYLE OF LITERATURE. TEXTUAL CRITICISM. ESTABLISH THE ORIGINAL WORDING. TRANSLATION. TRANSLATE THE HEBREW, ARAMAIC, OR GREEK TEXT, AND COMPARE OTHER TRANSLATIONS. GREEK GRAMMAR. UNDERSTAND HOW SENTENCES COMMUNICATE WITH WORDS, PHRASES, AND CLAUSES. ARGUMENT DIAGRAM. TRACE THE LOGICAL ARGUMENT BY ARCING, BRACKETING, OR PHRASING. HISTORICAL-CULTURAL CONTEXT. UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION IN WHICH THE AUTHOR COMPOSED THE LITERATURE AND ANY HISTORICAL-CULTURAL DETAILS THAT THE AUTHOR MENTIONS OR PROBABLY ASSUMES. LITERARY CONTEXT. UNDERSTAND THE ROLE A PASSAGE PLAYS IN ITS WHOLE BOOK. WORD STUDIES. UNPACK KEY WORDS, PHRASES, AND CONCEPTS. A GOOD STUDY BIBLE TAKES ALL OF THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND HIGHLIGHTS WHAT IS MOST SIGNIFICANT FOR UNDERSTANDING BOOKS OF THE BIBLE AND PARTICULAR PASSAGES. THE INTRODUCTIONS TO EACH BOOK OF THE BIBLE EXPLAIN THE BROAD LITERARY CONTEXT AND RELEVANT HISTORICAL-CULTURAL CONTEXT, AND THE STUDY NOTES EXPLAIN INDIVIDUAL PARTS IN THAT LARGER CONTEXT. WHEN THE TEXT IS THE BIBLE, WE MUST NEVER STOP WITH EXEGESIS: WE MUST ALSO DO THEOLOGY BIBLICAL, HISTORICAL, SYSTEMATIC, AND PRACTICAL THEOLOGY. 2. BIBLICAL THEOLOGY. MAKE ORGANIC CONNECTIONS WITH THE WHOLE CANON ON ITS OWN TERMS, ACROSS THE STORYLINE OF THE BIBLE, ESPECIALLY REGARDING HOW THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS INTEGRATE AND CLIMAX IN CHRIST. (I TRY TO SHOW HOW HARRY POTTER ILLUSTRATES BIBLICAL THEOLOGY IN THE FOUR-MINUTE VIDEO BELOW.) THIS IS A MAIN DISTINCTIVE OF THE NIV ZONDERVAN STUDY BIBLE. 3. HISTORICAL THEOLOGY. SURVEY AND EVALUATE HOW SIGNIFICANT EXEGETES AND THEOLOGIANS HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE BIBLE AND THEOLOGY. 4. SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY. DISCERN HOW A PASSAGE THEOLOGICALLY COHERES WITH THE WHOLE BIBLE. THIS IS A MAJOR STRENGTH OF THE ESV STUDY BIBLE. 5. PRACTICAL THEOLOGY. APPLY THE TEXT TO YOURSELF, THE CHURCH, AND THE WORLD. QUALITY STUDY BIBLES ARE ONE OF THE MOST HELPFUL ALL-AROUND TOOLS YOU CAN USE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE BIBLE. SO BY ALL MEANS USE THEM (RESPONSIBLY) AS YOU FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE GOD-BREATHED TEXT.

SAM BURGESS V JAMIE ROBERTS THERE WILL BE ALIENS ON DISTANT PLANETS CRANING THEIR TWO HEADS TO TRY TO HAVE A LOOK AT THIS ONE. THAT THE BIG AND POWERFUL BURGESS IS A HANDFUL IS NOT IN DOUBT. LESS CERTAIN IS WHETHER THE FORMER RUGBY LEAGUE MAN IS MUCH GOOD AT UNION. AGAINST FIJI LAST FRIDAY HE LOOKED SERIOUSLY UNSURE OF HIMSELF WITH HIS DEFENSIVE POSITIONING AND WHILE HE CAN OFFLOAD SKILFULLY OUT OF TACKLES, TEST RUGBY DEMANDS A LOT MORE THAN THAT. WITH HIS VAST EXPERIENCE, ROBERTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO WIN THIS ONE WITHOUT TOO MANY PROBLEMS, BUT HE AND SCOTT WILLIAMS MUST RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO RUN DIRECTLY AT THE ENGLISH CENTRES TOO OFTEN. OWEN FARRELL V DAN BIGGAR FARRELL HAS BEEN BUSSED IN AHEAD OF GEORGE FORD PRESUMABLY FOR HIS DEPENDABILITY: HE IS GOOD IN DEFENCE, KICKS HIS GOALS AND IS GENERALLY A FINE PERCENTAGE PLAYER. HE DOESN'T HAVE A CREATIVE SPARK, THOUGH, SOMETHING BIGGAR HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO DEVELOP IN RECENT YEARS, EVEN IF HE REMAINS A WORK IN PROGRESS IN THAT RESPECT, TOO. BOTH ARE GOOD GOAL-KICKERS. BIGGAR'S ABILITY IN THE AIR IS PRICELESS TO WALES AND SO ARE HIS LEADERSHIP QUALITIES AND HIS BRAVERY IN DEFENCE. THE BIG STAGE FRIGHTENS SOME; BIGGAR WILL HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A GAME LIKE THIS ALL HIS LIFE. JOE MARLER V TOMAS FRANCIS THE ENGLISH FRONT ROW SURPRISINGLY HIT PROBLEMS IN THE SCRUMS AGAINST FIJI, WITH THE ISLANDERS HAVING A CLEAR EDGE FOR MUCH OF THE GAME. MARLER IS A STEADY TEST PERFORMER, BUT HE CAN HAVE HIS OFF DAYS AND FRANCIS WILL BE HOPING TO APPLY PRESSURE IN LONDON. FOR THE EXETER CHIEF, IT IS A CASE OF BETTER THE DEVIL HE KNOWS, WITH WALES'S TIGHT-HEAD HAVING COME ACROSS MARLER AND DONE WELL AGAINST HIM IN THE AVIVA PREMIERSHIP. THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTION MARKS OVER FRANCIS'S FITNESS AROUND THE FIELD, BUT IF THERE ARE ISSUES ON THAT FRONT, WALES HAVE SAMSON LEE TO COME ON. CHRIS ROBSHAW V SAM WARBURTON ROBSHAW HAS A HUGE ENGINE AND WILL GRAFT UNTIL DAISY IS BACK IN THE COWSHED, BUT HE IS ALSO ONE-PACED AND MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED TO HAVE EVEN MADE WALES'S WORLD CUP SQUAD, LET ALONE THEIR STARTING LINE-UP. IN WARBURTON, HE IS UP AGAINST A WORLD-CLASS OPERATOR WHO IS STRONG OVER THE BALL AND FORMIDABLE IN CONTACT. THE CARDIFF BLUE CAN ALSO WEIGH IN WITH 20 OR SO TACKLES SHOULD THE OCCASION DEMAND. ENGLAND NEED ROBSHAW TO ACHIEVE PARITY AT THE BREAKDOWN, BUT AS AN OPENSIDE WARBURTON IS IN A DIFFERENT LEAGUE.

ROBERT URGES TRACY TO TELL THE TRUTH - TO CONFESS TO CARLA THAT IT WAS HER WHO STARTED THE FIRE. ITS NOT EASY WATCHING HER TORTURE HERSELF OVER SOMETHING YOU DID. THIS OF COURSE BEGS THE QUESTION, WHY IS HE SO BOTHERED? IS IT BECAUSE HE IS JUST ON THE SIDE OF JUSTICE OR IS IT BECAUSE HE THINKS TRACY WILL FEEL BETTER FOR CONFESSING? HE TELLS TRACY THAT SHE SHOULD CONFESS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, OR ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE TO. ROY SPOTS CARLA DRINKING AND LOOKING AT MADDIES MEMORIAL. ROY ASKS, DO YOU THINK DRINKING IS A GOOD IDEA? HER REPLY ALWAYS. CARLA IS DRINKING, AGAIN, THIS TIME IN HER CAR, AND TRACY GETS IN AND SITS BESIDE HER. ALL THIS MOPING ABOUT, THIS WEIRD CRAWLING AROUND LIKE SOME MESSENGER OF DOOM. ITS BORDERLINE SELF INDULGENT, ITS NOT A GOOD LOOK. TRACY PLEADS WITH CARLA, TELLING HER TO STOP BLAMING HERSELF FOR THE DEATHS OF KAL AND MADDIE. SHE TELLS HER THE FIRE WAS AN ACCIDENT. WITH NO WARNING, CARLA HEADS OFF IN HER CAR WITH TRACY AS HER PASSENGER. BUCKLE UP BARLOW, WERE IN FOR A GOOD RIDE. GOODNESS ONLY KNOWS WHAT THE ALCOHOL LEVEL IN CARLS BLOOD MUST BE BY NOW. IT SEEMS SHE HAS BEEN DRINKING NON-STOP FOR WEEKS. TRACY IS CONCERNED THAT CARLAS DRIVING HEAVILY UNDER THE INFLUENCE, BUT CARLA YELLS AT HER, CHILL OUT TRACY, WERE NOT GOING TO CRASH. IVE KILLED ENOUGH PEOPLE FOR ONE LIFETIME. THE 2 WOMEN ARRIVE AT A QUARRY AND CLAMBER UP TO THE EDGE. THIS IS THE PLACE, SHE REVEALS WHERE SHE USED TO PLAY WITH HER BROTHER ROB AND THEIR MATES. SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS ARE CLEARLY AT THE FOREFRONT OF CARLAS MIND. TRACY TELLS HER IT WONT CHANGE ANYTHING IF SHE JUMPS. ITS JUST FATE, SHE SAYS. CARLA CARRIES THE FATE IDEA ON. FATE, YES, RED OR BLACK, HEADS OR TAILS, ITS JUST THE WAY THINGS FALL. HEADS I STAND, TAILS I FALL, SAYS CARLA. IT SEEMS AS IF CARLA IS JUST ABOUT TO GO OVER THE EDGE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE IS A SCREAM OF CARLA! WAIT! I DID IT! CARLA ASKS TRACY WHY SHE BOTHERED TO SAVE HER LIFE WHEN THE BUS CRASHED. SHE ADDS THAT IF TRACY HADNT SAVED HER, KAL AND MADDIE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE. TRACY REVEALS ALL. UNDERSTANDABLY CARLA IS VERY SHOCKED. THE 2 WOMEN ENGAGE IN A TUSSLE. EVENTUALLY THEY ARRIVE BACK ON THE COBBLES AND TRACY HAS TOLD EVERYTHING. HOW SHE STOLE MICHELLES KEYS TO GET INTO CARLAS FLAT AND HOW SHE WANTED CARLAS LIFE TO END, SEEING HER AS THE CAUSE OF ALL HER MISERY, INCLUDING ROBS GOING TO PRISON AND CARLA BUYING THE SHARE OF THE PUB THAT SHE, TRACY, HAD WANTED WITH TONY. TRACY CONFESSES THAT SHE WANTED TO MAKE CARLA PAY. IT SEEMED THAT CARLA HAD EVERYTHING AND THAT SHE, TRACY HAD NOTHING LEFT. AN EXTREMELY (UNDERSTANDABLY) UNFORGIVING CARLA TELLS TRACY, MY STAFF DESPISE ME, MY FRIENDS FEEL SORRY FOR ME, MY BUSINESS IS ON ITS KNEES. IVE THROWN IT ALL AWAY -ALL FOR TAKING THE RAP FOR YOU! ZEEDAN IS PLAYING A BLINDER! WHAT A RESPONSIBLE, THOUGHTFUL AND CONCERNED YOUNG MAN HE HAS BECOME. THE RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN LEANNE AND ZEEDAN IS THOROUGHLY PLAUSIBLE AND A JOY TO SEE. STILL GRIEVING FOR HIS DAD OF COURSE, HE DOES WHAT HIS DAD WOULD HAVE WANTED HIM TO DO AND THAT IS TO LOOK OUT FOR LEANNE. PRAISE TOO TO THE SHARIF FAMILY, AS A WHOLE, FOR WELCOMING LEANNE INTO THEIR FAMILY. LEANNE HAS ALREADY CONFESSED THAT SHE IS FRIGHTENED OF SIMON AND THAT HER STAY IN HOSPITAL IS DUE TO SIMONS VIOLENCE TOWARDS HER. LEANNE, STILL NOT FULLY RECOVERED, ASKS ZEEDAN TO HELP HER FIND SIMON. THIS PLAYS WELL. IT IS FULLY CREDIBLE THAT YOU CAN LOVE SOMEONE DEEPLY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING AFRAID OF THEM AND ALSO BEING ANXIOUS AS TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE AGGRESSOR. AN EXTREMELY UPSET AND WORRIED LEANNE IS ON THE POINT OF REPORTING SIMONS DISAPPEARANCE TO THE POLICE, ON KENS ADVICE WHEN, AMY TELLS THEM THAT HES UPSTAIRS IN HER BEDROOM. LEANNE RUSHES UPSTAIRS TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAS BEEN HIDING IN AMYS WARDROBE, BUT WHEN AMY WAS ASKED IF SHE HAD SEEN HIM OR KNEW WHERE HE WAS, SHE LIED. WE NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOUNG AMY SIMON IS DISTRAUGHT THAT LEANNE HAS TOLD ZEEDAN, WHO SIMON LOOKS UP TO, THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HES DONE. BUT ZEEDAN COVERS FOR LEANNE AND TELLS SIMON THAT HE GUESSED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT HE IS GUTTED. YOURE NOT THE LAD I THOUGHT YOU WERE. MAYBE THAT WILL OPEN SIMONS EYES AND HE WILL REALISE HOW LUCKY HE IS TO HAVE LEANNE AS HIS MUM. ZEEDAN TELLS SIMON THAT HE HAS LOST HIS MUM AND HIS DAD AND THAT SOME DAYS HE WANTS TO PUNCH BRICK WALLS, OTHERS, HE STRUGGLES TO GET OUT OF BED. HE SAYS HE WOULD NEVER LIFT A HAND TO HIS FAMILY. YOURE A GOOD KID SI, DEEP DOWN, I KNOW YOU ARE. ZEEDANS CONCERN FOR HIS FATHERS INTENDED, EVEN EXPANDS TO HIS TURNING UP WITH HIS SLEEPING BAG AND INSISTING HE IS STAYING THE NIGHT AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT SIMON IS NO LONGER A DANGER TO LEANNE. SIMON TELLS HIM, SHE DOESNT NEED A BODY GUARD. ZEEDAN REPLIES, AND YOURE GOING TO PROVE THAT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. ADMIRABLE. UNADMIRABLE IS THE WAY IN WHICH DAVID AND KYLIE ARE PLOTTING TO GET SHUT OF GAIL. THEY REASON THAT IF LILY COULD HAVE HER OWN ROOM THEN THEIR NIGHTS MIGHT BE BETTER. GAIL TELLS SALLY THAT THEY WANT HER OUT. ON SALLYS ADVICE GAIL DECIDES TO CONSULT TONY TO SEE IF IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO CONVERT THE GARAGE INTO A GRANNY FLAT FOR HER TO LIVE IN. SALLY, AU FAIT IN ALL MATTERS MODERN, OR AT LEAST SHE THINKS SHE IS, SAYS ITS NOT FRENCH DOORS, ITS BI-FOLDS AND ALSO THAT THEY ARE THE NEW BLACK. SHE ADDS THAT AN EN SUITE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. GAIL SPEAKS OF ASSISTED LIVING AS THE DEATH OF HOPE. ANNA AND TIM DO SEEM TO BE GETTING ON VERY WELL. THEY ARE BOTH DELIGHTED THAT THEYLL SEE MILEY SOON AND LOOK AT PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER. FAYE IS ASKED TO LOOK AT THE PHOTOGRAPHS BUT JUST SAYS CUTE. SHE IS SINGING THE LONELY GOAT HERD SONG, FROM THE SOUND OF MUSIC IN WHICH SHE WILL PLAY MARIA AND IN WHICH SHE IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED.

839	LET ME SAY FIRST OFF: NOBODY KNOWS WHETHER WYOMINGS PLAN TO CONSERVE SAGE GROUSE IS GOING TO WORK. IF SOMEBODY DOES CLAIM TO KNOW WITH CERTAINTY, THEN YOU HAVE GOOD REASON TO BE SKEPTICAL. THATS BECAUSE SAGE GROUSE CONSERVATION IS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM WITHIN AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX NATURAL SYSTEM. WYOMINGS UPDATED PLAN, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE SPECIES MOST IMPORTANT HABITATS -- THEIR CORE AREAS -- MIGHT BE THE BIRDS BEST BET. BUT LIKE ANY PLAN, THE SUCCESS OF WYOMINGS CONSERVATION STRATEGY, AND SIMILAR STRATEGIES IN OTHER WESTERN STATES, WILL ULTIMATELY COME DOWN TO HOW WELL THE PLANS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY WE CAN ADAPT TO NEW INFORMATION AND EMERGING SCIENCE. WHATS NOTABLE IS THAT THIS EFFORT MIGHT WELL BE A MODEL FOR A NEW KIND OF APPROACH: A HOMEGROWN, STAKEHOLDER-INCLUSIVE, COLLABORATIVE MEANS TO CONSERVATION WHERE IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. RANCHERS, BIOLOGISTS, INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES, CONSERVATIONISTS, AGENCY AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND OTHERS ARE INVOLVED IN CRAFTING THE PLAN AND THUS HAVE STRONG BUY-IN FOR ASSURING ITS IMPLEMENTATION. FOR READERS WHO DONT KNOW, WYOMINGS PLAN IS THE PRODUCT OF AN UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATIVE EFFORT IN RECENT YEARS TO CONSERVE THE GREATER SAGE-GROUSE, WHICH IS ONE OF WYOMINGS AND THE WESTS MOST ICONIC, BEAUTIFUL -- AND IMPERILED -- SPECIES. GOVS. DAVE FREUDENTHAL AND MATT MEAD BOTH UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS AT STAKE: IF THE SAGE GROUSE WERE LISTED AS A THREATENED OR ENDANGERED SPECIES, ENERGY EXTRACTION AND OTHER TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT WOULD LIKELY BE CURTAILED THROUGHOUT THE BIRDS RANGE, AND NOT ONLY IN CORE HABITAT AREAS. IN A STATE THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON REVENUES FROM MINERAL EXTRACTION, SUCH A POSSIBILITY GETS FOLKS ATTENTION. IF WYOMING HADNT STEPPED UP WHEN IT DID, ITS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROTECTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN BOTH NECESSARY AND UNAVOIDABLE. SOMETIMES JUST THE THREAT OF THIS KIND OF FEDERAL ACTION CAN BE THE IMPETUS FOR BETTER WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES. OUR GOVERNORS APPROACH HAS BEEN TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE IN WYOMING, WHERE AN ESTIMATED 40 PERCENT OF THE REMAINING SAGE-GROUSE LIVE. FREUDENTHAL LED THE EFFORT TO CREATE WHAT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE STATES CORE AREA STRATEGY. MEAD HAS FURTHERED THAT EFFORT, REFINING THIS STRATEGY TWICE ALREADY, AS NEW INFORMATION AND NEW SCIENCE HAS EMERGED. THEY EMPOWERED A BROAD GROUP OF CITIZENS, EXPERTS AND SCIENTISTS TO WORK ON THE PROBLEM YEAR AFTER YEAR, DRAWING UPON UPON LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND STAKEHOLDER EXPERTISE, WITH THE COMMON GOAL OF MAKING SURE MEASURES ARE TAKEN SO THAT AN ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING DECISION IS NOT NECESSARY. THAT GOAL HAS BEEN, AND REMAINS, A TALL ORDER. SAGE GROUSE AND SAGE GROUSE HABITAT ARE IN TROUBLE. THE SPECIES HAS BEEN IN STEADY DECLINE FOR A LONG TIME NOW, AND ITS ESTIMATED THAT TODAY THERE ARE ABOUT 80 PERCENT TO 90 PERCENT FEWER SAGE GROUSE RANGE-WIDE THAN THERE WERE 150-200 YEARS AGO. WYOMINGS ACTIONS WILL LIKELY PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DETERMINING WHETHER OVERALL SAGE GROUSE POPULATIONS BEGIN TO STABILIZE OR CONTINUE TO DECLINE. MY OPINION: THE STATES PLAN CAN WORK IF ITS FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED. AND WHILE I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE, I ALSO KNOW THAT A GOOD PLAN CAN JUST AS QUICKLY BECOME AN EMPTY PROMISE IF COMMITMENT WAVERS. WYOMING WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN FOR DECADES, LONG AFTER THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE MAKES ITS LISTING DECISION THIS MONTH. STATE REGULATORS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL BE FACED WITH TOUGH DECISIONS AND BEFORE LONG THEY WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ALLOWING DEVELOPMENT OR PROTECTING IMPORTANT HABITAT -- THAT WILL BE THE TEST. AND YEARS FROM NOW I HOPE THIS ADMINISTRATIONS LEGACY IS NOT THAT IT KEPT THE BIRD OFF THE LIST IN 2015 BUT THAT IT KEPT IT FROM EXTINCTION. CRAFTING THE PLAN WAS THE EASY PART. LIVING UP TO ITS PROMISE? NOW THAT WILL TAKE SOME WORK.
840	ON TWITTER , HARDLINERS ARE THREATENING JOB ACTION SUCH AS A WORK-TO-RULE CAMPAIGN, HOUR CUTBACKS AND CANCELLATION OF FLU-SHOT CLINICS.  THEN YOU SUBMERGE YOUR SCREENS AND START WASHING OUT THE DIRT. TOTH SAID THE OMA, WHICH REPRESENTS 28,000 MEMBERS, WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITHGOVERNMENT AND IS CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION. HEALTH MINISTER ERIC HOSKINS SAID HE WANTS TO REASSURE ONTARIANS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERVICE CUTS. "MY CONCERN IS THAT A PERCEPTION IS BEING PROPAGATED THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE CHALLENGING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE FACTS SIMPLY DON'T BEAR THIS OUT," HE AID.  THE 41-YEAR-OLD LOOKED DISAPPOINTE AS HE RECEIVED ONLY 17 POINTS, BUT HE VOWED TO DO BETTER NEXT WEEK. ONTARIO DOCTORS ARE AMONG THE BEST PAID IN CANADA WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL OMPENSATION OF ABOUT $350,000, AN AMOUNT THAT HAS GROWN BY 60 PER CENT OVER THAT LAST DECADE, HOSKINS SAID. FROM THAT, PHYSICIANS PAY OVERHEAD COSTS, SUCH AS EMPLOYEE WAGES AND OFFICE RENT, AN AMOUNT WIDELY QUOTED AS ABOUT 30 PER CENT.  ARMY TRANSCONTINENTAL MOTOR CONVOY THE FIRST-EVER CONVOY ACROSS THEU.S.  THE RENEWED HOPES FOR THE YUAN TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SDR BASKET AFTER PRESIDENT XIS VISIT TO THE U.S., AND REDUCED EXPECTATIONS FOR FEDERAL RESERVE TIGHTENING CONTRIBUTED TO THE YUANS STRENGTH THIS WEEK, SAID JU WANG, A HONG KONG-BASED CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT HSBC HOLDINGS PLC. HOSKINS SAID PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED OVER WHAT IS A DISPUTE OVER REMUNERATION: "I HAVE RECEIVED ASSURANCE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE OMA THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE ACTION THAT WILL IMPACT THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY PROVIDE OR PATIENT SAFETY. I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD." THE RIFT DATES BACK TO A PAYMENT SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT UNILATERALLY IMPOSED LAST JANUARY AFTER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OMA ENDED IN AN IMPASSE. IT INCLUDED A 2.65 PER CENT FEE CUT AND A CLAWBACK PROVISION THAT WOULD TAKE EFFCT IF OCTORS' OHIP BILLINGS WERE TAKING DOCTORS OVER THEIR $11.6-ALLOTMENT. THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENT MODEL ALLOWS DOCTORS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPENSATION. IF THEY SEE MORE PAIENTS AND PERFORM MORE PROCEDURES, THEY CAN BILL THE PUBLIC INSURANCE PLAN FOR MORE MONEY. THE PAYMENT SCHEME ALSO INCLUDES INCREASES OF 1.25 PER CENT IN THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES BUDGET FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE ANNUAL INCREASES ARE INTENDED TO MEET A RISE IN DEMAND FROM A GROWING AND AGING POPULATION AND THE ADDITION OF 700 NEW DOCTORS. BUT THE OMA CONTENDS INCREASES OF 2.7 PER CENT ARE NEEDED IN EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO KEP UP WITH DEMAND GROWTH. THE OMA IS LOBBYING MPPS, HOLDING TOWN HALL MEETINGS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE PROVINCE AND STAGING A VIRTUAL TOWN HALL WITH MEMBERS NEXT WEEK. TOTH ARGUED THERE IS A "POWER IMBALANCE" WITH GOVERNMENT AND CALLED FOR A NEUTRAL THIRD-PARTY TO WEIGH IN WITH A BINDING DECISION: "WE ARE LOOKING TO RESOLVE THIS ... WE THINK THE WAY TO DO THIS IS MEDIATION-ARBITRATION." ONTARIO DOCTORS WARN THAT PATIENS WILL HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CUTTING THEI FEES. THE GOVERNMENT IS CHOPPING FEES BY 1.3 PER CENT STARTING NEXT WEEK TO KEEP THE PROFESSION WITHIN AN ALLOTTED $11.6-BILLON BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. DR. MICHAEL TOTH, PRESIDENT OF THE ONTARIO MEDICAL ASSOCIATION , SAYS THE PROFESSION IS FRUSTRATED AND SOME MEMBERS ARE TALKING ABOUT LEAVING THE PROVINCE OR RETIRING EARLY. "IT'S GOING TO AFFECT PATIENTS ULTIMATELY," HE WARNED, NOTING THAT SOME PHYSICIANS WILL BE FORCED TO LAY OFF STAFF AND CUT OFFICE BUDGETS. PHYSICIANS ARE VENTING THEIR ANGER ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

842	THE HEAD OF BOBIRWA DISTRICT HEALTH MANAGEMENT TEAM (DHMT) HAS TOLD COUNCILLORS THAT HIS TEAM WAS KEEN TO ELIMINATE MALARIA FROM THE SUB-DISTRICT. GIVING A PRESENTATION ON THE MALARIA SITUATION IN BOBIRWA RECENTLY, DR JACKSON KAGUAMBA SAID THE HOTSPOTS VILLAGES WERE SEMOLALE, MATHATHANE, LENTSWELEMORITI, MOLALATAU AND MOLETEMANE. DR KAGUAMBA SAID THE INDOOR RESIDUAL SPRAYING (IRS) EXERCISE TO WIPE MALARIA A DISEASE CAUSED BY ANOPHELES MOSQUITO, WOULD START IN OCTOBER. HE ASSURED THE COUNCILLORS THAT HE WOULD PERSONALLY LEAD THE CAMPAIGN TO ENSURE THAT ALL HOUSES IN AREAS WHERE IRS WOULD BE CONDUCTED WERE COVERED. DURING SEPTEMBER, HE NOTED THAT DMHT WOULD BE ENGAGED IN THE RECRUITMENT AS WELL AS THE TRAINING EXERCISE. DR KAGUAMBA STATED THAT UNLIKE IN AREAS LIKE CHOBE AND OKAVANGO, MALARIA IN BOBIRWA WAS SEASONAL ESPECIALLY DURING RAINY SEASONS, COULD CAUSE FATALITIES IF UNATTENDED. THEREFORE, HE CALLED FOR COLLABORATION WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO ALLOW THE DHMT TEAM TO SPRAY THEIR HOUSES, BECAUSE MALARIA HAD DEVASTATING EFFECTS AS IT CAUSES ILLNESS AND DEATH, HAD NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS ON THE ECONOMY, AFFECTS TOURISM AND AGRICULTURE. "TOURISTS FEAR VISITING COUNTRIES THAT ARE PRONE TO MALARIA LISTED BY WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION (WHO)", HE SAID. BOTSWANA, HE SAID HAD A CLEAR MISSION TO TOTALLY ELIMINATE MALARIA OUT OF THE COUNTRY, BUT WAS CONCERNED THAT THE BLANKET IRS CAMPAIGN IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS IN THE DISTRICT DID NOT PRODUCE THE INTENDED RESULTS, YIELDING ONLY 62 PER CENT, WHICH WAS BELOW THE WHO TARGET OF 85 PER CENT. DR KAGUAMBA SAID EVERY YEAR THE COUNTRY USES OVER P20 MILLION FOR IRS, AND AS SUCH THERE WAS A NEED FOR THOROUGH SUPERVISION TO ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT FUNDS WERE NOT WASTED. HE DESCRIBED IRS AS AN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE METHOD OF CONTROLLING MALARIA, BUT STATED THAT PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE FAITH IN IT, BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY STILL GET BEING BITTEN BY MOSQUITO AFTER SPRAYING. APART FROM SPRAYING, HE SAID THEY ISSUE TREATED NETS ESPECIALLY TO PREGNANT MOTHERS, CHILDREN UNDER FIVE YEARS, ELDERLY AND DISABLED PEOPLE. THE DHMT HEAD SAID SUCH MOSQUITOES THAT BITE AFTER CONDUCTING IRS WERE HARMLESS AND NONSENSICAL AND COULD NOT SPREAD THE MALARIA PARASITE. "IRS SHORTENS THE LIFESPAN OF THE MOSQUITO AND WE SHOULD SPRAY ENOUGH HOUSES TO ELIMINATE MALARIA AND FAILING TO DO SO WASTE GOVERNMENT MONEY," HE ADDED. IF THE AREAS WERE FULLY COVERED, HE SAID THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO CONDUCT THE IRS THE FOLLOWING YEAR, BUT WOULD ENGAGE IN THE MONITORING EXERCISE ONLY. HE DESCRIBED THE IRS AS THE SAFE CHEMICAL RECOMMENDED BY WHO EXPERTS AND USED ACROSS COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, AND ADVISED THAT INHABITANTS THAT MIGHT DEVELOP REACTIONS AFTER SPRAYING MUST VISIT CLINICS AND HOSPITALS. DR KAGUAMBA STATED THAT DHMT NEEDED FOUR VEHICLES TO SUPERVISE THE CAMPAIGN AND HE APPEALED TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO HELP THEM WITH RESOURCES, BECAUSE CURRENTLY THEY HAD TWO VEHICLES ON THE GROUND. COUNCILLORS APPLAUDED DHMT FOR THE EXERCISE AND KGOSI LETSO MALEMA OF MOLALATAU SUGGESTED THAT AREAS SUCH AS CATTLE POSTS, SEPTIC TANKS MUST BE SPRAYED BECAUSE THEY WERE THE BREEDING POINTS FOR MOSQUITOES. COUNCILLOR KEOAGILE RAMATLOTLO OF LDANDANE-MABELENG SAID THERE WAS A NEED TO EDUCATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC ABOUT IRS, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAD MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT IT. SOURCE

844	NOTE: FOR INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL PROJECTS AND COST ESTIMATES, SCROLL BELOW ... ENID, OKLA. ENID PUBLIC SCHOOLS DISTRICT IS EXPERIENCING AN ENROLLMENT BOOM, AND OFFICIALS ARE PLANNING A BOND ELECTION ON THE HORIZON. AT A BOARD OF EDUCATION MEETING IN JULY, DANNY JARDINE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF CARTER AND ASSOCIATES, PRESENTED THE DISTRICTS HISTORIC AND PROJECTED ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN RELATION TO LIVE BIRTHS IN GARFIELD COUNTY. IN 2007, LIVE BIRTHS SPIKED IN THE COUNTY TO 1,024; THERE WERE 935 LIVE BIRTHS IN 2006, AND 947 LIVE BIRTHS IN 2008. HE SAID THE BOOM OF BIRTHS WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE EPS DISTRICT. BETWEEN 2003 AND 2015, ENROLLMENT AT EPS HAS GROWN BY 1,619 STUDENTS, AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE RISING TO AN ESTIMATED 9,580 BY THE 2023-24 SCHOOL YEAR, ACCORDING TO JARDINES REPORT. AS THAT BUBBLE OF STUDENTS FROM THE 2007 APEX IN LIVE BIRTHS MOVES UP THROUGH THE DISTRICT, SCHOOL CAPACITIES WILL BE STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT, AND EVENTUALLY OVERFLOWING, HE SAID. BY THE 2019-20 SCHOOL YEAR, EPS MIDDLE SCHOOLS WILL BE OVERCAPACITY BY AS MANY AS 241 STUDENTS, AND 64 STUDENTS AT ENID HIGH SCHOOL; BY THE 2023-24 SCHOOL YEAR, ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WILL BE OVERCAPACITY BY 40 STUDENTS, MIDDLE SCHOOLS OVERCAPACITY BY 212 STUDENTS AND EHS OVERCAPACITY BY 548 STUDENTS. THE NEED FOR CLASSROOM ADDITIONS ACROSS THE DISTRICT IS IMMINENT, AND EPS IS IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING WHEN AND WHERE TO ADD FACILITIES, JARDINE SAID. PRELIMINARY PLANS FOR FACILITY IMPROVEMENT INCLUDE CLASSROOM ADDITIONS AT GARFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, LONGFELLOW AND WALLER MIDDLE SCHOOLS, A NEW FINE ARTS AND CLASSROOM FACILITY AT EHS AND A NEW MULTI-PURPOSE WELLNESS CENTER. EPS ADMINISTRATORS ARE WORKING TO NAIL DOWN ADDITIONAL FACILITY UPDATES AND RENOVATIONS AT SCHOOLS ACROSS THE DISTRICT IN TIME FOR A BOND ELECTION IN FEBRUARY, BUT EPS SUPERINTENDENT DARRELL FLOYD SAID NOTHING IS SET IN STONE YET. A WELLNESS FACILITY AND COMPETITIVE GYM WOULD PROVIDE TRAINING AND COMPETITION FACILITIES FOR DISTRICT ATHLETICS, AS WELL AS MULTIPURPOSE AREAS FOR STUDENTS ACROSS THE DISTRICT, FLOYD SAID. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS AN EARLY CHILDHOOD CAMPUS AT NORTHWESTERN OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY IN ENID, FLOYD SAID, WHICH WOULD FREE UP 24 CLASSROOMS ACROSS THE DISTRICT. THE DISTRICT TRANSPORTATION FLEET ALSO NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO REPLACE AGING OR HIGH-MILEAGE VEHICLES, FLOYD SAID. THE DISTRICT IS CONSIDERING PURCHASING SEVERAL PASSENGER VANS AND BUSES, SUVS, AND IT VEHICLES, WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO COST $2.5 MILLION AND COULD BE A PART OF AN ELECTION IN FEBRUARY. IN ADDITION TO FACILITY AND TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS, THE BOND ISSUE WOULD ALSO ADDRESS SAFETY AND SECURITY NEEDS; IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE TO UPGRADE TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY TO STUDENTS; ADDRESS PLAYGROUND NEEDS; AND POSSIBLY INCLUDE PLANS FOR FUTURE LAND ACQUISITION. SCHOOL PRINCIPALS PROVIDED ADMINISTRATORS WITH LISTS OF THINGS THEY THOUGHT NEEDED TO BE DONE AT THEIR SCHOOLS, AND FLOYD SAID THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DIVIDED THOSE LISTS INTO NEEDS, WANTS AND DESIRES, ACCORDING TO NECESSITY. THE DISTRICT IS STILL WORKING ON COST ESTIMATES FOR THESE UPDATES, BUT RELEASED PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES AT A STAKEHOLDERS MEETING ON JULY 14 (SCROLL BELOW FOR LISTS OF COST ESTIMATES AND TOP PROJECTS). THIS DISTRICT-WIDE INITIATIVE WOULD INCLUDE UPDATES TO EXISTING FACILITIES AT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS CLASSROOM ADDITIONS, A WELLNESS CENTER, COMPETITIVE GYM, FINE ARTS ADDITION, SAFETY AND SECURITY MEASURES, PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS, FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT AND A TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE, WHICH TOTAL TO AN ESTIMATED $62 MILLION IN ADDITION TO THE TRANSPORTATION INITIATIVE. GOING FORWARD, THE DISTRICT WILL CONTINUE TO MEET WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS, PARENTS AND STAFF TO PINPOINT DETAILS, AND WILL RELEASE AN UPDATED COST ESTIMATE BEFORE DECEMBER, FLOYD SAID.

846	LISBON, PORTUGAL CHELSEA BEGAN ITS EUROPEAN CAMPAIGN WITH A 4-0 HOME WIN OVER MACCABI TEL AVIV. NEXT UP, THOUGH, IS FC PORTO ON TUESDAY, AND THE BLUES HAVE IN THE PAST STRUGGLED AGAINST THE PORTUGUESE OUTFIT. MOURINHO HAS TWICE RETURNED TO HIS FORMER CLUB SINCE LEAVING IT FOR CHELSEA IN 2004, RECORDING A DEFEAT AND A DRAW IN HIS FIRST SPELL IN CHARGE OF THE ENGLISH CLUB. PORTO'S OPENING GROUP GAME BROUGHT A 2-2 DRAW AGAINST DYNAMO KIEV. IN THE OTHER GROUP G GAME, MACCABI TEL AVIV HOSTS DYNAMO KIEV. ---- OLD ANTAGONISTS MEET THERE COULD BE A FROSTY ATMOSPHERE AT PORTO'S ESTADIO DO DRAGAO WHEN MOURINHO AND IKER CASILLAS CROSS PATHS AGAIN. PORTO'S SPANISH GOALKEEPER MAY WELL BE BEARING A GRUDGE AGAINST THE CHELSEA COACH FROM THEIR TIME TOGETHER AT REAL MADRID. THEIR RELATIONS BECAME STRAINED IN 2012 WHEN THEN-REAL COACH MOURINHO SURPRISINGLY BENCHED THE LONGTIME SPAIN AND CLUB GOALKEEPER, CAUSING AN OUTCRY. CASILLAS, WHO MOVED TO PORTO FROM MADRID LAST SUMMER, WAS LEFT OFF REAL'S FIRST TEAM FOR FIVE MONTHS AND SAID THE EPISODE MADE HIM CRY. IT DIDN'T HURT HIS CAREER MUCH, THOUGH: HE IS POISED TO BECOME TUESDAY THE PLAYER WITH MOST CHAMPIONS LEAGUE APPEARANCES, OVERTAKING XAVI HERNANDEZ TO PLAY IN THE TOURNAMENT FOR THE 152ND TIME. MOURINHO WILL LIKELY GET ANOTHER WARM RECEPTION FROM PORTO FANS WHO REMEMBER HIM AS THE COACH WHO WON THEM THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IN 2004 THE PORTUGUESE CLUB'S SECOND EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS TROPHY. RADAMEL FALCAO, WHO PLAYED FOR PORTO FROM 2009-11, ALSO RETURNS IN CHELSEA COLORS. ---- DIFFERING FORM CHELSEA HAS STRUGGLED DOMESTICALLY THIS SEASON AND IT DREW 2-2 AGAINST TROUBLED NEWCASTLE UNITED AT THE WEEKEND. IT HAS A 2-2-3 RECORD AND HAS HALF AS MANY POINTS AS PREMIER LEAGUE LEADER MANCHESTER UNITED. WHILE THE DEFENDING ENGLISH CHAMPION'S CONFIDENCE IS DENTED, PORTO IS JOINT LEADER OF THE PORTUGUESE LEAGUE. PORTO IS UNDEFEATED IN SIX DOMESTIC GAMES AND IS ON A 12-MATCH UNBEATEN RUN IN ALL COMPETITIONS, THOUGH IT WAS SURPRISINGLY HELD TO A 2-2 DRAW BY MINNOW MOREIRENSE LAST WEEKEND. IN EUROPE, CHELSEA HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER PORTO WITH FOUR VICTORIES IN THE PREVIOUS SIX ENCOUNTERS, PORTO WINNING ONLY ONE. THE LONDON CLUB HAS WON EACH THE LAST THREE ENCOUNTERS, ALL BY A SINGLE GOAL. --- IN AND OUT (MAYBE) CHELSEA STRIKER DIEGO COSTA RECEIVED A THREE-MATCH RETROSPECTIVE BAN FOR VIOLENT CONDUCT AGAINST ARSENAL IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE BUT IS AVAILABLE FOR CHELSEA IN EUROPE AND IS EXPECTED TO LEAD THE ATTACK IN NORTHERN PORTUGAL. PORTO'S STANDOUT ATTACKING MIDFIELDER YACINE BRAHIMI HURT HIS KNEE IN THE WEEKEND GAME AND IS DOUBTFUL. ---- MACCABI'S BACK MACCABI TEL AVIV, BACK IN THE COMPETITION AFTER 11 YEARS AND HOSTING ITS FIRST CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GAME SINCE 2004, IS COMING OFF ITS FIRST WIN IN FOUR GAMES IN DOMESTIC COMPETITION. DYNAMO KIEV, WHICH IS BACK IN THE TOURNAMENT AFTER A TWO-SEASON ABSENCE, IS ON A 37-GAME UNBEATEN RUN IN UKRAINE.
847	HERE ARE SEVEN COMPLETELY REAL, JAW-DROPPING APPLICATIONS OF CLOUD COMPUTING THAT CAN TRANSFORM HUMANITY. MADE POSSIBLE WITH CLOUD TECHNOLOGY, DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD ABOUT SUCH APPLICATIONS. 1. SHOES SOLD BY THE STEP IMAGINE BUYING THE WORLD'S BEST SHOES OR FOR THAT MATTER ANY PAIR OF SHOES AND PAYING ZERO DOLLARS FOR THEM UPFRONT. THAT WOULD BE CRAZY RIGHT? WELL THE INTERNET OF THINGS CAN MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN POWER EVERYTHING WE DO AND CREATE NEW WAYS OF DOING THEM, VENDORS OF CONSUMABLE ITEMS CAN SELL ITEMS BASED ON A UNIQUE MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN ON A FLAT FEE. SHOES MAY BE SOLD FOR THE NUMBER OF STEPS YOU ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE IN THEM OR CAR TIRE MANUFACTURERS MAY CHARGE YOU BASED ON THE NUMBER OF KILOMETERS YOU DRIVE. NO MATTER WHAT, THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF CHARGING A CUSTOMER WILL CHANGE WITH THE INTERNET OF THINGS AND CLOUD COMPUTING. THIS IDEA IS BASED ON CONSUMPTION CLOUD COMPUTING THAT MEASURES THE USAGE OF A SPECIFIC SERVICE OR PRODUCT AND CHARGES THE END USER IN REAL TIME. THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS. 2. IDENTIFY DISEASE BREAKOUTS BIG DATA IN SIMPLE TERMS IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF DATA THAT IS GENERATED THROUGH A SPECIFIC APPLICATION OR WEBSITE. TAKE FACEBOOK OR TWITTER AS EXAMPLES. BOTH THESE WEBSITES GENERATE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DATA EVERY SECOND THAT'S AGGREGATED. YOU CAN NOW FIND OUT FROM MILLIONS OF DATA POINTS TO WHAT YOUR CUSTOMERS REACT AND WHAT ACTION TO TAKE. IN THIS SAME WAY, YOU CAN NOW TAKE DATA FROM SAY A SPECIFIC POPULATION OR DEMOGRAPHIC AND FIND OUT INCONSISTENCIES OR DATA POINTS THAT CAN HELP IDENTIFY THINGS SUCH AS A DISEASE OUTBREAK. JUST A FEW YEARS BACK GOOGLE MADE HEADLINES FOR BEING ABLE TO PINPOINT THE OUTBREAK OF FLU IN REAL TIME USING DATA IT RECEIVED IN ITS SEARCH ENGINE SEARCH. IMAGINE PREDICTING A DROUGHT, AN EBOLA OUTBREAK OR THE PLAGUE. 3. LOTS OF IT WITHOUT BUYING IT IF YOU HAVE EVER WORKED FOR A LARGE COMPANY IN THE IT DEPARTMENT, YOU WOULD KNOW THE SHEER AMOUNT OF MONEY BIG COMPANIES SPEND ON IT INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S NOT IN THE THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS EVEN. IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS AND EVEN BILLIONS. ORGANIZATIONS OVERALL ARE NOW ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE POWER OF CLOUD COMPUTING TO MAKE LOW OR NO INVESTMENT INTO EXPENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. INSTEAD THEY CAN NOW HAVE SCALABLE INFRASTRUCTURE ON DEMAND THROUGH DATA CENTERS. IN MANY CASES ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOW ALSO CONSOLIDATING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE IN LOW-COST GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS AND ACCESSING IT FROM THE INTERNET. MADE POSSIBLE WITH THE POWER OF CLOUD COMPUTING, FLEXIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE IS A FAST-GROWING ASPECT OF THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. 4. HIGHER EDUCATION AT YOUR FINGERTIPS THE AVAILABILITY OF MASSIVE ONLINE OPEN COURSE OR MOOC IS A BOON TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ANYTHING NEW. MOOCS HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY EDUCATION IS DELIVERED AND ACCESSED OR AS I LIKE TO SAY "CONSUMED" BY PEOPLE HUNGRY TO LEARN YOU CAN NOW START A COURSE FROM MANY OF THE WORLD'S RENOWNED EDUCATION ESTABLISHMENTS SUCH AS HARVARD UNIVERSITY, PENN STATE OR HUNDREDS OF OTHER UNIVERSITIES RIGHT FROM YOUR BEDROOM. MOOCS ARE COURSES DELIVERED OVER THE INTERNET. MADE POSSIBLE PRIMARILY BECAUSE CLOUD COMPUTING, THEY HAS HELPED US CHANGE THE WAY WE DELIVER AND USE INFORMATION. 5. 3D PRINTING TRANSFORMS ON-DEMAND MANUFACTURING 3D PRINTING IS TAKING THE WORLD BY STORM. THE ABILITY TO PRINT ANYTHING IN AN INSTANT IS REVOLUTIONARY TO THE LEVEL THAT IT IS BEING USED FROM HEALTHCARE TO SPACE EXPLORATION. 3D PRINTING IS BEING USED TO GENERATE PERFECTLY MADE BONE REPLACEMENTS TO AN ACTUAL SOCKET WRENCH THAT WAS DESIGNED ON EARTH, AND 3D PRINTED AND USED IN SPACE. THE APPLICATIONS OF THIS ARE REVOLUTIONARY. IMAGINE NO NEED FOR MANUFACTURING PLANTS OR FACILITIES. INSTEAD ALL YOU NEED IS A COMPOSITE DESIGN OF WHAT YOU NEED AND A 3D PRINTER CAPABLE OF PRINTING IT. ALTHOUGH NOT COMMERCIALLY VIABLE YET, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN'T START PRODUCING THINGS AT A MASS SCALE, THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES WHERE 3D PRINTING HAS BEEN USED TO GENERATE A KEY PIECE OF MATERIAL. CLOUD COMPUTING TODAY IS HELPING PROVIDE THE COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO CREATING DESIGNS OR PROCESSES USED IN 3D PRINTING. 6. LIVE TRANSLATION BREAKS DOWN BORDERS WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT - NOW YOU CAN SPEAK TO YOUR LONG-ESTRANGED RELATIVES IN THEIR LANGUAGE AND YET HAVE NO NEED TO LEARN IT. YES. LIVE TRANSLATION TECHNOLOGIES, CURRENTLY BEING PUSHED OUT BY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES LIKE MICROSOFT AND GOOGLE, ARE THE ABILITY TO TRANSLATE SPEECH FROM ONE LANGUAGE TO ANOTHER WHILE BEING SPOKEN. LIVE TRANSLATION IS GOING TO BE REVOLUTIONARY AS IT BREAKS DOWN BARRIERS BETWEEN COUNTRIES, REGIONS AND PEOPLE. NO COMMUNICATION GAPS MEAN THE ABILITY TO DO MORE, COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY AND BEING UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY. THIS WOULD OPEN MORE DOORS FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER MORE AND PERHAPS LEAD TO INCREASED TRADE, COMMERCE AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES WORLDWIDE. MAYBE FEWER WARS. 7. PREVENT NATURAL DISASTERS KNOWING WHEN A DISASTER IS LIKELY TO STRIKE COULD BE KEY LIFESAVING INFORMATION IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP. TODAY, TECHNOLOGIES THAT MEASURE SEISMIC ACTIVITY, WEATHER PATTERNS AND VOLCANIC ACTIVITY ARE USED EVERYWHERE. WHAT, HOWEVER, CAN BE DONE FURTHER IS TO ENABLE THE FASTER GATHERING AND PROCESSING OF DATA TO ALLOW SOMETHING WE CALL ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS. DATA FROM SENSORS CAN BE PROCESSED MUCH FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY WITH CLOUD COMPUTING PLATFORMS SUCH AS BIG DATA. THIS INFORMATION CAN NOT ONLY HELP SAVE LIVES, BUT ALSO HELP IDENTIFY PATTERNS AND CAN BE USED AS INDICATORS FOR FUTURE CALAMITIES. THINK ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PREDICT THE NEXT KATRINA DAYS AHEAD.

850	EMILY KINNEY MAY NO LONGER BEFLEEING FROM ZOMBIES ON THE WALKING DEAD , BUT SHES STILL ON THE RUN FROM BAD LOVE. KINNEY HAS BEEN WRITING AND RELEASING HER OWN MUSIC SINCE 2011S BLUE TOOTHBRUSH EP . IN 2013, SHE PICKED UP HER ACOUSTIC GUITAR AGAIN TO OUTLINE THE EMOTIONAL HIGHS AND LOWS OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER FOLLOW-UP EP, EXPIRED LOVE . WHILE THOSE RELEASES FOCUSED ON A SENSE OF DEFEAT, SHES NOW TAKING CHARGE OF HER LIFE. THIS WAS EVIDENT IN HER IMPASSIONED TREEHOUSE SESSION EARLIER THIS SUMMER, AND NOWSHES TAKING HER DETERMINED MESSAGE TO THE MASSES WITH HER DEBUT FULL-LENGTH. ENTITLED THIS IS WAR , SHES PREVIEWED THE OCTOBER 2ND RELEASE WITHA NEW SONG CALLED MESS. I WROTE THIS AFTER REALIZING I GENERALLY FELT WORSE AND LESS ORGANIZED AND KIND OF MEAN AND CRAZY EVERY TIME I HUNG OUT WITH THIS PERSON, BUT I GUESS I WAS ADDICTED TO THAT FEELING AND MAYBE KIND OF STILL AM, KINNEY TELLS CONSEQUENCE OF SOUND . I ESPECIALLY LOVE THE MANDOLIN PARTS ON THIS RECORDING, THE WAY THEY PEEK THROUGH THE REST OF THE ARRANGEMENT AT CERTAIN MOMENTS, PERFORMED BY MY FRIEND SIMON KAFKA. THOUGH THE SONGS LIGHT ACOUSTIC AESTHETIC MAY LEAN MORE TWEE THAN THRASH, SHE SHOWSAFFECTION FOR REBELLION.AS A STAR OF MASTERS OF SEX , IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE HOW SEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE SOME OF THE LYRICS CAN BE. SHE OUTLINES BRUISES ON HER NECK, HAIR PULLING AND RIPPING DRESSES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MIXING IN ADORABLE METAPHORS ABOUT ANKLE BRACELETS. ITS LIKE A TWEE FIFTY SHADES OF GREY , PLAYING WITH THE LISTENERS PERCEPTIONS OF KINNEY AND HER GENRE. THE SONGS VIDEO COMES FROM FAN LAURA PYTRYKOW, WHO HAD ENTERED KINNEYS CONTEST LIP SYNCH/COVER CONTEST FOR HER TRACK BIRTHDAY CAKE. KINNEY WAS TAKEN BY PYTRYKOWS ENTRY, BUT SINCE IT WASNT ACTUALLY A LIP SYNCH OR COVER, IT COULDNT BE SELECTED AS A WINNER.

IT IS GOOD TO HAVE DANE BACK FROM HIS INJURY AND IMRAN WAS OUR NO. 1 SPINNER FOR OUR LAST TEST SERIES ON THE SUB-CONTINENT AGAINST SRI LANKA. ZONDI ALSO CONFIRMED THAT DANE VILAS WOULD RETAIN THE GLOVES IN THIS FORMAT. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY IN OUR SELECTIONS AND DANE HARDLY HAD THE CHANCE TO MAKE HIS MARK IN BANGLADESH WHERE THE SERIES WAS SO BADLY DISRUPTED BY THE WEATHER. IMRAN ALSO RETURNS TO THE OXIGEN PROTEAS T20 SQUAD IN THE PLACE OF AARON PHANGISO WHILE THERE ARE ALSO RECALLS FOR CHRIS MORRIS AND MARCHANT DE LANGE. THE TOUR TO INDIA IS A VERY LONG ONE, EMPHASIZED ZONDI. IT LASTS FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AND WE CANT EXPECT DALE STEYN AND MORNE MORKEL TO FIELD TOO HEAVY A WORKLOAD. CHRIS COMES BACK AFTER A SPELL OUT THROUGH INJURY WHILE MARCHANT HAS DONE WELL AT THE IPL. IT IS AN IDEAL OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE OUR BACK-UP OPTIONS AHEAD OF THE ICC WORLD TWENTY20 WHICH WILL BE PLAYED IN INDIA. IT IS VITAL IN THIS FORMAT TO GET WICKETS UP FRONT. IMRAN IS OUR NO. 1 BOWLER IN THE T20 FORMAT AND WE NEED HIM TO PLAY EVERY SERIES BETWEEN NOW AND THE ICC TOURNAMENT WHILE EDDIE LEIE WILL BE OUR SECOND SPINNER AS WE WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT WHAT HE CAN DO. CHRIS IS ALSO A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR A POSITION AS A BOWLING ALL-ROUNDER IN THE ODI TEAM SO THIS IS ANOTHER OPTION WE WANT TO EXPLORE. WE ALSO BELIEVE HE IS WELL SUITED TO THE CONDITIONS WE WILL ENCOUNTER THERE. RILEE ROSSOUW HAS BEEN RULED OUT OF THE T20 SQUAD THROUGH INJURY BUT SHOULD RETURN TO FULL FITNESS IN TIME FOR THE ODI SERIES. HIS PLACE IN THE T20 SQUAD WILL BE TAKEN BY NEW CAP, KHAYA ZONDO. THE LATTER HAD THE SECOND BEST BATTING AVERAGE OF 38.50 (BEHIND QUINTON DE KOCK) FOR SOUTH AFRICA A IN THE RECENT TRIANGULAR ODI SERIES IN INDIA AND ALSO HAD THE BEST STRIKE RATE OF THOSE WHO PLAYED IN ALL FOUR MATCHES (106.94). HE WILL BECOME THE 65TH PLAYER TO REPRESENT THE PROTEAS IN THE T20 FORMAT.

852	REVISED THE ISSUE: THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE BY THE END OF THE MONTH WHETHER IT WILL PUT THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST. WE BELIEVE: FISH AND WILDLIFE SHOULD HOLD OFF AND LET CURRENT CONSERVATION EFFORTS WORK. WE DO THINK THE AGENCY SHOULD MAINTAIN ITS THREAT AS A MEANS TO KEEP THOSE PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD. TELL US WHAT YOU THINK: CONTACT US VIA EMAIL AT OPINION@WYOMINGNEWS.COM . IT IS BEING CALLED "THE LARGEST CONSERVATION EFFORT EVER UNDERTAKEN." AND IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. BUT SUPPORTERS OF THE 11-STATE EFFORT TO SAVE THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE SAY THEY WILL LOSE MUCH OF THEIR MOMENTUM - AND PERHAPS THE BIRD ITSELF - IF THE U.S.  WE AGREE. IN TRUTH, JUST THE THREAT OF THAT LISTING HAS DRIVEN A BROAD COALITION OF STATE AGENCIES, PRIVATE INDUSTRY, LANDOWNERS AND NONPROFIT GROUPS TO COMMENDABLY JOIN HANDS, MAKE COMPROMISES AND SET IN PLACE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS TO SAVE THE GROUSE. TAKE THAT THREAT AWAY, OR PUT THE AUTHORITY FOR CONTROLLING THE PROCESS INTO FEDERAL HANDS - AND PERHAPS COMPLICATE AND OVER-REGULATE THE EFFORT - AND MANY OF THEM SIMPLY WILL WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE. AT STAKE IN THIS DISCUSSION IS A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY DEVELOPED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENTS OF INTERIOR AND AGRICULTURE TO MANAGE THE GROUSE ON BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT AND FOREST SERVICE LAND. IT INCORPORATES THE BATTLE PLANS DEVELOPED SEPARATELY IN RECENT YEARS BY THE 11 STATES - STRETCHING FROM WYOMING TO CALIFORNIA AND NORTHWARD TO THE CANADIAN BORDER - IN THE BIRDS' RANGE. (WYOMING HAS BEEN AMONG THE LEADERS IN THE PROCESS, MAINLY BECAUSE MOST OF THE BIRDS RESIDE WITHIN ITS BORDERS.  5, 1965: SPRINGFIELD GIANTS LOSE 9-0 TO PITTSFIELD RED SOX IN FINAL PRO BASEBALL GAME AT PYNCHON PARK. A FEDERAL LISTING COULD HAVE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES HERE, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF RESTRICTING THE ESSENTIAL ENERGY INDUSTRY.) THE GOAL OF THE BLM EFFORT IS TO SAVE THE BIRD BY PROTECTING AND BUILDING UP ITS SAGEBRUSH HABITAT. ITS RANGE HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM 500,000 TO 250,000 SQUARE MILES, AND ITS NUMBERS HAVE DROPPED FROM 16 MILLION, BY SOME ESTIMATES, TO ABOUT 400,000. AND SCIENTISTS BELIEVE ITS NUMBERS CONTINUE TO DIP. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE PLANS SET ASIDE "CORE AREAS," WHERE DEVELOPMENT IS NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE OR WHERE WORK STOPPAGES OCCUR AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR, SUCH AS IN MATING SEASON. OTHER EFFORTS ALSO ARE MADE TO PROTECT THE GROUSE IN THESE ESSENTIAL AREAS, SUCH AS DISCOURAGING WIND DEVELOPMENT OR BANNING OIL AND GAS PIPELINES AND TRANSMISSION LINES. BUT THERE ARE OTHER BENEFITS FROM THESE EFFORTS.  AND CANADA, ONLY TO LATER LAUGH IT OFF AS RIDICULOUS. THE GROUSE IS AN "UMBRELLA SPECIES." THAT MEANS IT SHARES ITS HABITAT WITH SOME 350 OTHER SPECIES, SEVERAL OF WHICH ALSO MAY BE HEADED FOR LISTING BY THE FEDS. BOOSTING THE GROUSE'S HABITAT HELPS THEM AS WELL.  THE DEER'S NUMBERS ALSO ARE ON THE DECLINE IN THE COWBOY STATE. OUR HOPE IS THAT FISH AND WILDLIFE WILL HOLD OFF ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING AND ALLOW THESE BLM PLANS TO BE PUT INTO ACTION. THE AGENCY SHOULD MAINTAIN THE THREAT OF LISTING, PERHAPS CREATING TIMELINES FOR REVIEWING OUTCOMES, IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM MOVING FORWARD.  READQUICK HELPS YOU READ FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE. BUT IF THE PLANS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THIS ACTUALLY COULD SET A NEW DIRECTION FOR WORKING WITH THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT, RATHER THAN ALL SIDES ACTING AS ADVERSARIES. ADDITIONALLY, THIS NEWSPAPER URGES WYOMING'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO BACK OFF OF ITS EFFORTS TO FORESTALL FEDERAL SAGE GROUSE ACTION THROUGH LEGISLATION. THAT MIGHT DELAY A LISTING, BUT IT ALSO COULD IMPLODE THESE COALITIONS BY REMOVING THEIR INCENTIVE TO WORK FOR THE BIRD AND FOR THEIR STATES. AND WITHOUT THESE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS, THE GROUSE THEN COULD END UP IN A WORSE PLACE AFTER A FEDERAL MORATORIUM, SINCE EFFORTS TO BUILD THEIR HABITAT WOULD HAVE FALTERED.  THE BALL IS NOW IN KHARTOUMS COURT. AND THAT WOULD VIRTUALLY GUARANTEE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING DOWN THE ROAD. WE ENCOURAGE BOTH CONGRESS AND THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE TO LET THIS INNOVATIVE CONSERVATION EFFORT WORK. IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO WASTE THE TIME AND MONEY SPENT ALREADY TO SAVE THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE WHEN IT VERY WELL COULD YIELD REAL FRUIT IN THE YEARS AHEAD.

853	PSALM 121:1-2 (NLT) 1 I LOOK UP TO THE MOUNTAINSDOES MY HELP COME FROM THERE? 2 MY HELP COMES FROM THE LORD, WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH! WE MUST SEE ALL OUR HELP LAID UP IN GOD, IN HIS POWER AND GOODNESS, HIS PROVIDENCE AND GRACE; AND FROM HIM WE MUST EXPECT IT TO COME: "MY HELP COMES FROM THE LORD; THE HELP I DESIRE IS WHAT HE SENDS, AND FROM HIM I EXPECT IT IN HIS OWN WAY AND TIME. IF HE DO NOT HELP, NO CREATURE CAN HELP; IF HE DO, NO CREATURE CAN HINDER, CAN HURT.' [MATTHEW HENRY COMMENTARY] IN THE BOOK PRAYER, TIM KELLER WRITES: IN THE SECOND HALF OF MY ADULT LIFE, I DISCOVERED PRAYER. I HAD TO. IN THE FALL OF 1999, I TAUGHT A BIBLE STUDY COURSE ON THE PSALMS. IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT I WAS BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF WHAT THE BIBLE COMMANDED AND PROMISED REGARDING PRAYER. THEN CAME THE DARK WEEKS IN NEW YORK AFTER 9/11, WHEN OUR WHOLE CITY SANK INTO A KIND OF CORPORATE CLINICAL DEPRESSION, EVEN AS IT RALLIED. FOR MY FAMILY THE SHADOW WAS INTENSIFIED AS MY WIFE, KATHY, STRUGGLED WITH THE EFFECTS OF CROHN'S DISEASE. FINALLY, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER. AT ONE POINT DURING ALL THIS, MY WIFE URGED ME TO DO SOMETHING WITH HER WE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MUSTER THE SELF-DISCIPLINE TO DO REGULARLY. SHE ASKED ME TO PRAY WITH HER EVERY NIGHT. EVERY NIGHT. SHE USED AN ILLUSTRATION THAT CRYSTALLIZED HER FEELINGS VERY WELL. AS WE REMEMBER IT, SHE SAID SOMETHING LIKE THIS: IMAGINE YOU WERE DIAGNOSED WITH SUCH A LETHAL CONDITION THAT THE DOCTOR TOLD YOU THAT YOU WOULD DIE WITHIN HOURS UNLESS YOU TOOK A PARTICULAR MEDICINEA PILL EVERY NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP. IMAGINE THAT YOU WERE TOLD THAT YOU COULD NEVER MISS IT OR YOU WOULD DIE. WOULD YOU FORGET? WOULD YOU NOT GET AROUND TO IT SOME NIGHTS? NOIT WOULD BE SO CRUCIAL THAT YOU WOULDN'T FORGET, YOU WOULD NEVER MISS. WELL, IF WE DON'T PRAY TOGETHER TO GOD, WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT BECAUSE OF ALL WE ARE FACING. I'M CERTAINLY NOT. WE HAVE TO PRAY, WE CAN'T LET IT JUST SLIP OUR MINDS. LET US ALL TAKE A MOMENT TODAY TO PRAY TO THE LIVING GOD THANKING HIM FOR THE HELP, MERCY, GRACE AND LOVE PROVIDED. IN OUR PRAYERS REMEMBER THOSE OF 9/11, THE FAMILIES, FRIENDS AND RESPONDERS.
854	LAST WEEK, I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE KEY INSIGHTS FROM THE SHEFORSHIELD REPORT REGARDING THE WAYS IN WHICH WOMEN ARE CHANGING THE GLOBAL INSURANCE MARKET. SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS FROM THE REPORT INCLUDE: THE BIRTH OF A SALESWOMAN: WOMEN IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY ARE A PERFORMING SALESFORCE. IN PARTICULAR, THEIR POINT OF DIFFERENTIATION RELATES TO THEIR ABILITY TO DEVELOP LONG-TERM CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS, THEREBY IMPROVING CLIENT RETENTION AND POSSIBLY INFLUENCING THE ITERATIVE UPTAKE OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS WITH EXISTING CLIENTS. EMPOWER WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS: 1/3 OF THE WORLDS ENTREPRENEURS ARE WOMEN WHO WANT TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS AND TAKE MORE CALCULATED RISKS, BUT WHO FACE A GLARING GENDER GAP AND ACCESS TO FINANCE. BY HELPING THEM MANAGE THE RISKS, INSURANCE INCREASES WOMENS ABILITY TO ACCESS CREDIT AND HELPS THEM TO MAKE THIS LEAP. ONE SIZE DOESNT FIT EVERY WOMAN (AS WE ALL KNOW VERY WELL FROM FASHION): WOMEN (LIKE MEN) ARE NOT A HOMOGENEOUS GROUP BUT ARE A DIVERSE MARKET WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS DEPENDING ON THEIR INCOME, LOCATION, EMPLOYMENT AND STATUS. DIFFERENT WOMEN FACE DIFFERENT CONSTRAINTS IN ACCESSING AND USING INSURANCE. READ THE REPORT. DIGITAL CHANNELS: NOT ONLY FOR THE YOUNG, BUT ALSO FOR THE TIME-POOR. INSURERS NEED TO LEVERAGE DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND COMMUNICATE WITH WOMEN CLIENTS, AS THEY HAVE RECOURSE TO TIME-GAINING DIGITAL SERVICES TO MANAGE BOTH THEIR FAMILY AND PROFESSIONAL AGENDAS. GIVEN WOMENS ROLE AS CONDUITS AND THE VALUE THEY PLACE ON PEER TO PEER RECOMMENDATIONS, THEIR LACK OF TIME AND DESIRE TO SAVE IT, INSURERS SHOULD LEVERAGE TARGETED SOCIAL NETWORKS AND MOBILITY. STRONGER TOGETHER: PARTNERSHIPS WITH GOVERNMENTS, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, WOMENS ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER PRIVATE SECTOR PLAYERS CAN BE DEVELOPED TO EXPAND ACCESS TO INSURANCE FOR WOMEN. IN PARTICULAR, GIVEN THE EXTENT TO WHICH WOMEN TEND TO LACK TIME AND LOOK TO SAVE IT, THEY OFTEN SEE VALUE IN BUYING THINGS TOGETHER. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SHOULD LOOK TO IDENTIFY THE RIGHT PRIVATE PARTNER(S) WITH WHICH TO ENVISAGE A BUNDLED OFFER. IN THE FOURTH AND FINAL BLOG POST NEXT WEEK, I WILL SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE REPORTS RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO HOW INSURERS SHOULD ADDRESS THIS OPPORTUNITY. IN THE MEANTIME, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE REPORT HERE. READ PART ONE OF MY BLOG SERIES READ PART TWO OF MY BLOG SERIES

856	ARSENALS CONTINUED ROBUST FINANCIAL FIGURES MUST BE BACKED UP BY RESULTS ON THE PITCH, ACCORDING TO THE CHAIR OF THE ARSENAL INDEPENDENT SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATION. THE GUNNERS PARENT COMPANY ANNOUNCED A PROFIT OF 24.7 MILLION AND A CASH RESERVE OF 193.1 MILLION IN THE SAME WEEK AS ARSENE WENGERS SIDE SLUMPED TO A DISAPPOINTING 2-1 DEFEAT IN THEIR OPENING CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TIE AWAY TO DINAMO ZAGREB. THE RESULTS, COVERING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2015, PUT THE GROUPS TOTAL TURNOVER AT 344.5 MILLION, UP FROM 301.9 MILLION IN 2014. SEE MORE: WENGER FOCUSING ON SOCCER, CHELSEA INSTEAD OF MOURINHO . ARSENAL INVESTED HEAVILY IN ARSENE WENGERS FA CUP-WINNING SQUAD OVER THE PERIOD, WITH AN OUTLAY OF AROUND 114 MILLION AND INCREASED WAGES NOW UP TO JUST OVER 192 MILLION. HOWEVER, THE GUNNERS ADDED ONLY GOALKEEPER PETR CECH, SIGNED FROM CHELSEA, TO THE SQUAD DURING THE 2015 SUMMER TRANSFER WINDOW, AND THEY DID NOT BRING IN ANOTHER STRIKER AHEAD OF THE SEPTEMBER DEADLINE DESPITE A LENGTHY INJURY TO DANNY WELBECK . ALTHOUGH ARSENALS BUMPER CASH RESERVES, WHICH EXCLUDE A 35 MILLION PAYMENT ON THE LONG-TERM EMIRATES STADIUM FINANCING, ARE INTENDED TO COVER COSTS FOR A FULL SEASON, AND ARE NOT SOLELY DESIGNATED FOR PLAYER TRANSFERS, THERE ARE GROWING CALLS FOR SOME OF THE SURPLUS FUNDS TO BE USED ON RECRUITMENT. SEE MORE: PREMIER LEAGUE CLUBS STILL FAILING EUROPES TACTICS TESTS . AISA CHAIR LOIS LANGTON TOLD PRESS ASSOCIATION SPORT: ARSENALS FINANCIAL RESULTS AT LEAST SHOW THAT THE CLUB HAS PRODUCED ONE GOOD PERFORMANCE SO FAR THIS WEEK. THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE CLUB IS WELL-RUN. WHAT SUPPORTERS WANT TO SEE, HOWEVER, IS THAT THE FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE MATCHED BY RESULTS ON THE PITCH AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE TIMING FOR ARSENAL THAT THE RESULTS HAVE FOLLOWED HOT ON THE HEELS OF A WOEFUL PERFORMANCE IN EUROPE. SPENDING MONEY IN THE TRANSFER WINDOW ISNT ALWAYS THE ANSWER; ONE QUALITY SIGNING IS OFTEN BETTER THAN SEVERAL AVERAGE SIGNINGS. HOWEVER, IN A WEEK WHERE MANY SUPPORTERS HAVE SPENT CONSIDERABLE MONEY FOLLOWING THE TEAM INTO EUROPE ONLY TO SEE A BELOW-PAR PERFORMANCE, THE FINANCIAL FIGURES WILL ONLY ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE FOR THOSE CALLING FOR FURTHER SQUAD INVESTMENT.
857	AHMEDS CLOCK IN THE AGE OF GRIEVANCE-MONGERING A PHONY CASE OF ISLAMOPHOBIA BY KEVIN D. WILLIAMSON POSTED BY RUTH KING ON SEPTEMBER 18TH, 2015 HTTP://WWW.NATIONALREVIEW.COM/ARTICLE/424202/AHMED-MOHAMED-CLOCK AHMED MOHAMED IS A HUMAN RORSCHACH TEST. LOOK AT THAT FACE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE: MUSLIM-AMERICAN? AFRICAN-AMERICAN? I MYSELF SEE SOMETHING VERY FAMILIAR: NERD-AMERICAN. MOHAMED, A 14-YEAR-OLD HIGH-SCHOOL FRESHMAN IN TEXAS AND THE SON OF AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY FROM SUDAN, IS A CAUSE CLBRE JUST AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE HE WAS HANDCUFFED, FROG-MARCHED OUT OF A CLASSROOM, AND ARRESTED FOR THE CRIME OF SHOWING OFF HIS TECHNOLOGICAL CHOPS BY BUILDING AN ELECTRONIC CLOCK AND BRINGING IT TO SCHOOL TO SHOW HIS ENGINEERING TEACHER. (LET US NOW PRAISE MACARTHUR HIGH SCHOOL IN IRVING, TEXAS, FOR THE FACT THAT 14-YEAR-OLDS THERE HAVE ENGINEERING TEACHERS.) APPARENTLY, AN ENGLISH TEACHER IT HAD TO BE AN ENGLISH TEACHER THOUGHT THE DEVICE LOOKED LIKE A BOMB. IT DIDNT. BUT IT LOOKED A HELL OF A LOT MORE LIKE A BOMB THAN THAT HALF-EATEN POP-TART IN THE POSSESSION OF THAT SEVEN-YEAR-OLD IN MARYLAND LOOKED LIKE A GUN, YET THE CHILD WAS SUSPENDED; IT WAS SURELY MORE REASONABLE TO THINK THAT THOSE CIRCUIT BOARDS CONSTITUTED A BOMB THAN TO THINK THAT THE BANG-BANG! HAND GESTURE OF A TEN-YEAR-OLD IN MILFORD, MASS., CONSTITUTED A SERIOUS THREAT TO SHOOT SOMEBODY; TAKING A HIGH-SCHOOL KID INTO CUSTODY AFTER A TEACHER REPORTS A POSSIBLE BOMB THREAT IS SURELY NO MORE IRRATIONAL THAN ARRESTING AN EIGHTH-GRADER OVER AN NRA T-SHIRT. MOHAMEDS FATHER SAYS THAT HIS SON WAS MISTREATED BECAUSE THE INCIDENT HAPPENED A FEW DAYS AFTER THE ANNUAL COMMEMORATION OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TERROR ATTACKS, AND BECAUSE HIS NAME IS MOHAMED. THE STORY IMMEDIATELY BECAME UBIQUITOUS NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED BONEHEADED AS THAT WAS BUT BECAUSE IT CAN BE USED TO FURTHER A STORY THAT THE MEDIA ALREADY WANT TO TELL: THAT THE UNITED STATES IS MORALLY CORRUPT AND IRREDEEMABLY RACIST; THAT MUSLIMS ARE UNDER SIEGE; THAT WHITE PRIVILEGE BLINDS THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS TO THE CORRUPTION AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING RED, WHITE, AND BLUE. MUSLIM KID MEETS PARANOIA IN TEXAS IS A-1 COPY; NRA-WEARING KID MEETS PARANOIA IN WEST VIRGINIA, NOT SO MUCH. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, NEVER ONE TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CHEAP MORAL PREENING, INVITED MOHAMED TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THATS AN INTERESTING GESTURE: ANYBODY WANT TO HAZARD A GUESS AS TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A YOUNG MAN SHOWED UP AT THE WHITE HOUSE VISITORS CENTER WITH A BACKPACK IN WHICH WAS A HOMEMADE DEVICE FULL OF CIRCUIT BOARDS JOINED TO A TIMING DEVICE? I DO NOT FREQUENT THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT I OFTEN AM IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE OFFICE BUILDINGS IN WASHINGTON, AND MY BEST GUESS IS THAT IF ID TRIED TO BRING MOHAMEDS CLOCK INTO ONE OF THOSE PLACES, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN GUNS DRAWN. OH, BUT THOSE ARE HIGH-SECURITY ENVIRONMENTS! YOU MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO PROTEST. MOHAMED WAS ARRESTED BY HIGH-SCHOOL CAMPUS POLICE IN SUBURBIA, TEXAS. WHY ARE THERE POLICE STATIONED AT SUBURBAN HIGH SCHOOLS? BECAUSE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOW A HIGH-SECURITY ENVIRONMENT, OR AT LEAST MANY OF THEM ARE INTENDED TO BE. THAT IS TRUE NOT ONLYOF BIG CITIES, WHERE THE ARCHITECTURE OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS, NOT COINCIDENTALLY, PENAL; PUBLIC SCHOOLS FAR AND WIDE ACROSS THE FRUITED PLAIN GET THE METAL-DETECTORS-AND-MEN-WITH-GUNS TREATMENT. RELATED: #ISTANDWITHAHMED AGAINST AUTHORITARIAN IDIOCY MAYBE YOU THINK THAT IS APPROPRIATE. MAYBE IT IS. MAYBE EVERY NONCONFORMING TUBE OF OUTLAW PEPSODENT SEIZED BY TSA AGENTS IS IN REALITY A BLOW AGAINST AL-QAEDA, AND MAYBE BRIGHT-ORANGE PLASTIC SQUIRT-GUNS REALLY ARE A MENACE TO POLICE OFFICERS ROLLING THROUGH THE MALLS OF AMERICA IN ARMORED VEHICLES. BUT YOU CANNOT VERY WELL GO ACTIVELY CULTIVATING AN ATMOSPHERE OF PARANOIA AND THEN PRONOUNCE YOURSELF SURPRISED BY ALL THE PARANOIA IN THE AIR. #SHARE#THIS IS AN AGE OF OVERREACTION. IT IS, UNHAPPILY, ALSO AN AGE OF RACE-HUSTLING AND GRIEVANCE-MONGERING. THANK GOODNESS THAT FELONIOUS POP-TART IN MARYLAND WAS ONE OF THE STRAWBERRY-FLAVORED ONES WITH RAINBOW SPRINKLES AND NOT BROWN SUGAR/CINNAMON OR MARSHMALLOW HOT CHOCOLATE OR ANOTHER OF THE FLAVORS OF COLOR, OR WED BE HAVING A NATIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHITE-FROSTING PRIVILEGE. OF COURSE IT IS THE VERY SAME SELF-SATISFIED LIFESTYLE LIBERALS WHO WANT TO SEND YOUR TODDLER TO GITMO FOR PLAYING WITH A CAP GUN WHO ARE SO THEATRICALLY APPALLED AT WHAT HAPPENED TO MOHAMED. THE STRUCTURES OF PARANOIA THAT HAVE BEEN SO ASSIDUOUSLY FORTIFIED AROUND OUR SCHOOLS ARE THERE FOR A PURPOSE, AND THAT PURPOSE IS POLITICAL: TO IMMERSE YOUNG PEOPLE IN A CULTURE IN WHICH NRA LITERATURE IS SAMIZDAT BUT HOW-TO-FELLATE-YOUR-FRIENDS LITERATURE IS MANDATORY, WHERE WHITEWASHED ISLAMIC STUDIES ARE PART OF THE STANDARD CURRICULUM AND CHRISTIAN PRAYER GROUPS ARE VERBOTEN. THE PARANOIA IS INTENTIONAL, IT IS CULTIVATED WITH EXQUISITE CARE BUT IT ISNT SUPPOSED TO INFLICT COLLATERAL DAMAGE ON BESPECTACLED YOUNG MEN NAMED AHMED MOHAMED. THUS, THE PRESIDENTIAL INTERVENTION, ETC. AHMED MOHAMED WAS MISTREATED BY IMBECILES, AND HELL BE FAMOUS FOR IT, FOR 15 WARHOLIAN MINUTES, AND THEN AGAIN FOR A 30-SECOND SPOT WHEN HE GRADUATES IN A FEW YEARS AND GOES OFF TO MIT OR WHEREVER. THE FACT IS THAT HE IS NOT WORSE OFF BECAUSE HIS NAME IS MOHAMED, BUT BETTER OFF: NOBODY WOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION OTHERWISE, AND HE MIGHT VERY WELL BE IN JAIL. BEING MISTREATED BY IMBECILES IS THE SINE QUA NON OF AMERICAN PUBLIC EDUCATION TODAY, BUT THAT FACT IS OF POLITICAL USE ONLY PERIODICALLY, AS IN THIS CASE. KEVIN D. WILLIAMSON IS ROVING CORRESPONDENT AT NATIONAL REVIEW. CATEGORIZED UNDER: MAIN. TAGGED WITH: NO TAGS. COMMENTS ARE CLOSED.
858	I'VE ALWAYS FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT VACATIONING AND TRAVELING ARE TWO DISTINCT THINGS. WHILE I LOVE BOTH, I THINK IT DOES A DISSERVICE TO TRAVELERS TO CALL WHAT WE DO "VACATION" BECAUSE IT SOMEHOW IMPLIES THAT IT'S EASY OR THAT WE'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM LIFE, WHEN IN FACT, IT CAN BE A RICHER, MORE SUBSTANTIVE WAY OF LIVING. AS ANY TRAVELER WOULD ATTEST, IMMERSING YOURSELF INTO A CULTURE CERTAINLY ISN'T ALWAYS RELAXING OR EASY. EMBRACING A NEW PLACE MEANS NOT ONLY SEEING THE GOOD, BUT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THE BAD AND THE UGLY AND RESPECTING THE COUNTRY AND IT'S PEOPLE JUST THE SAME (WHICH, I WILL FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE, IS SOMETIMES MORE OF A PROCESS THAN A FINAL RESULT). FASHION AND BEAUTY MAGAZINES: I GENERALLY TRY TO PICK UP A COUPLE OF MAGAZINES TO LEAF THROUGH DURING DOWNTIME OR ON THE FLIGHT HOME. EVEN IF YOU CAN'T READ THE ARTICLES, THE PHOTOS AND ADVERTISEMENTS CAN PROVIDE INTERESTING INSIGHTS INTO LOCAL AESTHETICS, TRENDS, SOCIAL NORMS, AND BEAUTY DEFINITIONS AND RITUALS. FOR EXAMPLE, I'VE NOTICED THAT IN MANY ASIAN COUNTRIES, MAGAZINES SEEM TO CONTAIN ADS FOR SKIN LIGHTENERS WHILE MAGAZINES IN WESTERN COUNTRIES HAVE ADS FOR SELF-TANNERS. CLASSES: TAKING CLASSES IS A GREAT WAY TO INTERACT WITH LOCALS WHILE ALSO CULTIVATING KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN AN AREA OF LOCAL IMPORTANCE. EVEN IF THE CLASSES ARE TARGETED TOWARDS TOURISTS, YOU'LL STILL LEARN SOMETHING NEW AND MOST INSTRUCTORS WILL BE VERY OPEN TO SHARING INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR CULTURE. I PARTICIPATED IN A WORKCAMP IN DNEPROPETROVSK, UKRAINE IN 2000, RESTORING AN AFTER-SCHOOL CLUB FOR ORPHANS. OUR GROUP VOLUNTEERED FOR 4-5 HOURS A DAY AND THEN SPENT EVENINGS WITH OUR WORKCAMP LEADERS AND OTHER LOCALS, EXPLORING THE CITY AND GETTING TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER. TRAVBUDDY: THIS IS A GREAT WEBSITE TO CONNECT WITH EITHER OTHER TRAVELS OR LOCALS IN A GIVEN COUNTRY. MANY PEOPLE UTILIZE THIS WEBSITE TO LOOK FOR A SLOW TRAVEL PARTNER OR SWAP TIPS. BEFORE MY SOLO TRIP TO TURKEY IN LATE 2010, I UPDATED MY PROFILE WITH THE WHEN AND WHERE'S OF MY UPCOMING TRIP AND WITHIN MINUTES SEVERAL LOCALS SENT ME MESSAGES OFFERING TO SHOW ME AROUND. I PERUSED THEIR PROFILES AND ENDED UP MEETING UP WITH A NICE GUY IN ISTANBUL WHO TOOK ME ON AN EXTENSIVE TOUR OF HIS FAVORITE HAUNTS THROUGHOUT THE CITY. COUCHSURFING: THIS HAS PRETTY MUCH BECOME THE WEBSITE TO CONNECT TRAVELERS WITH THE LOCALS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN HOSTING THEM. COUCHSURFING HAS TAKEN GREAT STRIDES TO IMPLEMENT EXTENSIVE PROFILE AND REFERENCE FEATURES TO ENSURE THE COMPATIBILITY AND SAFETY OF ALL INVOLVED. THEY ALSO TRACK DETAILED LOCATION STATISTICS, DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, AND SUCCESS/FAILURE RATES, TO STAY ABREAST OF TRENDS AND ENSURE MEMBER ACCOUNTABILITY. CONTACT INFO: HTTP://TRAVELLIFEX.COM/

SILICON VALLEY WANTS YOUR NEXT BEAUTY CONSULTANT TO BE AN ALGORITHM. KIRSTEN ULVE/CORBIS WHAT IF SIRI COULD GIVE YOU BEAUTY TIPS? SILICON VALLEY GOT A STEP CLOSER MONDAY WHEN VENTURE CAPITALISTS WROTE A $100 MILLION CHECK TO A STARTUP CALLED IPSY TO BUILD THE NEXT-GENERATION GLOBAL BEAUTY BRAND. IPSY'S DOING IT WITH A $10 PER MONTH SUBSCRIPTION FOR A THEMED "GLAM BAG," WHICH IS FILLED WITH FIVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COSMETICS LIKE EYE SHADOW, BROWN GEL OR LIPSTICK. ON THE OUTSIDE, IPSY'S BAG LOOKS THE SAME, BUT THAT'S WHERE THE SIMILARITIES END FOR MOST IPSY CUSTOMERS. "A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, THE BAG WAS THEMED AROUND BOHEMIAN BEAUTY ... BUT THE PRODUCTS ARE CUSTOMIZED TO THE INDIVIDUAL SUBSCRIBER," SAID CEO AND CO-FOUNDER MARCELO CAMBEROS. IPSY CUSTOMERS RECEIVE ONE OF 200 DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF COSMETICS BASED ON THEIR ANSWERS TO 12 QUESTIONS THAT GIVE THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE A SENSE OF WHAT THEY LIKE. "THE PRODUCTS IN THE BAG WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FOR YOU AS IT WOULD A YOUNG BLACK WOMAN OR A WHITE WOMAN WHO'S REALLY INTO RED LIPSTICK." WELCOME TO SILICON VALLEY'S ANSWER TO THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY. STARTUPS LIKE IPSY BELIEVE THE FUTURE IS SUPER INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE THAT KNOWS YOUR TASTES SO WELL, IT WILL SEND PRODUCTS YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO LIKE. IT'S NOT A NEW IDEA. NETFLIX AND PANDORA CHANGED THE MOVIE AND MUSIC INDUSTRIES BY OFFERING RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON WHAT THEIR USERS WATCHED AND LISTENED TO. NOW, THE VENTURE CAPITALISTS BACKING STARTUPS LIKE IPSY BELIEVE THEY CAN DO THE SAME THING TO THE MALL'S CORNER BEAUTY STORE. THERE'S A LARGE PRIZE IF THEY SUCCEED. WORLDWIDE DEMAND FOR BEAUTY CARE PRODUCTS IS EXPECTED TO JUMP TO $461 BILLION, UP MORE THAN 21 PERCENT FROM 2013. SO FAR, SAN FRANCISCO-BASED IPSY HAS GRABBED ABOUT $150 MILLION OF THAT TOTAL EACH YEAR FROM ITS 1.5 MILLION
860	NOW AS THE KING PASSED BY, HE CRIED OUT TO THE KING AND SAID, YOUR SERVANT WENT OUT INTO THE MIDST OF THE BATTLE; AND THERE, A MAN CAME OVER AND BROUGHT A MAN TO ME, AND SAID, GUARD THIS MAN; IF BY ANY MEANS HE IS MISSING, YOUR LIFE SHALL BE FOR HIS LIFE, OR ELSE YOU SHALL PAY A TALENT OF SILVER.1 KINGS 20:39 (NKJV) I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW MY OWN ADVICE. AGE AND LIFE EXPERIENCE HAVE EQUIPPED ME TO ADVISE MY FRIENDS ON HOW TO NAVIGATE LIFE, BUT I USUALLY RESIST HEEDING MY OWN WISE COUNSEL WHEN ITS TIME TO APPLY IT TO MYSELF. WE HAVE ALL DONE THIS. IN TODAYS VERSE, KING AHAB IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. PROPHETS OF OLD TOLD DRAMATIC STORIES TO GET THEIR MESSAGES THROUGH TO PEOPLE WHO WERE DEAF TO TRUTH. NATHAN USED THIS TECHNIQUE WHEN HE FACED DOWN KING DAVID DURING THE BATHSHEBA/URIAH SCANDAL. IN TODAYS VERSE, A PROPHET GOT CREATIVE IN HIS DELIVERY OF GODS MESSAGE TO WICKED AHAB. THIS PROPHET ACTED HIS MESSAGE OUT. TO GET INTO CHARACTER, THE PROPHET CONVINCED SOMEONE TO BRUTALLY ASSAULT HIM SO HED LOOK LIKE A SOLDIER WOUNDED IN BATTLE. AND HERES THE SCENE: THE SOLDIER IS PANICSTRICKEN BECAUSE A PRISONER UNDER HIS OVERSIGHT HAS JUST ESCAPED. THE DEATH PENALTY AWAITS HIM UNLESS HE PAYS A RANSOM THAT NO HONEST SOLDIER COULD EVER RAISE. WHAT AHAB DOESNT KNOW YET IS GOD, THROUGH THIS PROPHET, IS HOLDING AHAB TO ACCOUNT FOR ONE OF MANY CRIMES COMMITTED AS KING. AHAB WAS NOTORIOUS FOR ARROGANTLY GOVERNING AND MISREPRESENTING THE HEART OF GOD. THE PROPHETS ELABORATE RUSE PROVES AHAB IS INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG. AS AHAB GIVES HIS OPINION ABOUT OUR WOUNDED SOLDIERS PREDICAMENT, HE PRONOUNCES JUDGMENT ON HIMSELF. AHAB HAD UNLIMITED RESOURCES TO DO HIS JOB, BUT HE SQUANDERED EVERYTHING GOD GAVE HIM TO FEED HIS OWN APPETITES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE POOR IN ISRAEL. THE PRESENT SIN BEING ADDRESSED BY THE PROPHET: AHABS COLLUSION WITH A CRONY KING TO ESCAPE JUSTICE. GODS MESSAGE TO AHAB: THE PARTY IS OVER. IRONICALLY, TO DEFLECT ENEMY ATTENTION, AHAB DISGUISES HIMSELF AS A COMMON SOLDIER. BUT A RANDOM ARROW FINDS ITS MARK AND AHAB DIES. WHEN GOD GIVES YOU POWER, HE EXPECTS YOU TO LEAD AS HIS REPRESENTATIVE, PROVIDING THE RESOURCES YOU NEED. BECAUSE IN THE END, WELL BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT WE DID WITH WHAT HE GAVE.

861	SEPTEMBER IS NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS MONTH, PART OF AN EFFORT TO HELP US BETTER PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS OUR COMMUNITIES MAY FACE. THIS YEARS THEME IS, DONT WAIT. COMMUNICATE. MAKE YOUR EMERGENCY PLAN TODAY, STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING A PLAN TO KEEP YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SAFE IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER. EMERGENCIES CAN ARISE IN AN INSTANT, AND WHILE WE OFTEN CANT PREVENT THEM, TAKING PROPER PRECAUTIONS CAN HELP LIMIT THEIR IMPACT. LAST YEAR, A MICROBURST IN EAST SYRACUSE TOOK DOWN TREES AND LEFT THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS IN THE VILLAGE WITHOUT POWER FOR UP TO A WEEK. HAVING AN EVENT OF THIS MAGNITUDE HIT SO CLOSE TO HOME REMINDS US THAT EVENTS LIKE THIS ARE ALL TOO COMMON. DISASTER CAN STRIKE IMMEDIATELY, AND YOU MAY LOSE ELECTRICITY OR HAVE TO LEAVE YOUR HOME UNEXPECTEDLY, SO ITS ESSENTIAL TO PREPARE. GATHERING WITH YOUR FAMILY TO DISCUSS WHAT TO DO IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO HELP ENSURE YOUR SAFETY. BE SURE TO AGREE ON A SAFE PLACE TO MEET OUTSIDE YOUR HOME, AND MAKE AN EVACUATION PLAN FOR ALL FAMILY MEMBERS, INCLUDING PETS. ALSO TAKE A MOMENT TO CHECK YOUR HOMES FIRE EXTINGUISHERS AND SMOKE AND CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS OR INSTALL THEM IF YOU HAVENT DONE SO ALREADY. THESE SAFETY FEATURES CAN ALERT YOU TO MOST IMMEDIATE DANGERS IN YOUR HOME AND HELP PREVENT UNNECESSARY FIRE DAMAGE OR SEVERE INJURY. MANY OF US ASSUME THAT FIRST RESPONDERS WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO REACH US IMMEDIATELY IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ISNT ALWAYS THE CASE DANGEROUS CONDITIONS, ROAD CLOSURES AND THE NEED TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATE THREATS TO THE DISABLED AND ELDERLY ARE JUST SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT CAN IMPACT RESPONSE TIME. THATS WHY ONONDAGA COUNTY AND THE AMERICAN RED CROSS RECENTLY LAUNCHED THE 3DAYOK CAMPAIGN, URGING RESIDENTS TO PREPARE EMERGENCY KITS WITH ENOUGH ESSENTIAL ITEMS TO LAST THREE DAYS. YOUR FAMILYS EMERGENCY KIT SHOULD CONTAIN AT LEAST A THREE-DAY SUPPLY OF FOOD AND WATER, AS WELL AS A FLASHLIGHT AND FIRST AID KIT. OTHER IMPORTANT ITEMS TO CONSIDER INCLUDE MEDICATIONS, COPIES OF IMPORTANT PERSONAL DOCUMENTS, CASH, SOAP AND BLANKETS. DURING A CRISIS, EVERY MOMENT COUNTS. TO STAY UP TO DATE ON SEVERE WEATHER, HIGHWAY CLOSURES AND OTHER EMERGENCIES IN YOUR AREA, CONSIDER SIGNING UP TO RECEIVE ALERTS BY PHONE, EMAIL OR TEXT THROUGH THE NY-ALERT SYSTEM.

MS TRAD SAID THE 12 PRIORITY PROJECTS NOMINATED WERE VITALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE QUEENSLANDS FUTURE ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY. SOUTH EAST QUEENSLAND IS HOME TO ONE IN SEVEN AUSTRALIANS AND IN THE NEXT 25 YEARS AN ADDITIONAL 2.2 MILLION PEOPLE WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION. THATS WHY IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE KEY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ARE PLANNED IMMEDIATELY, MS TRAD SAID. INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA HAS ALREADY RECOGNISED CROSS RIVER RAIL IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FOR THE NATION AND IT REMAINS SO FOR THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT. WE CONTINUE TO CALL ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COME TO THE TABLE WITH FUNDING SO THIS PROJECT CAN BE DELIVERED TO ADDRESS THE BRISBANE CBD CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS IDENTIFIED IN THE AUSTRALIAN INFRASTRUCTURE AUDIT. A SECOND RAIL RIVER CROSSING WILL EASE CONGESTION, UNLOCK ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND MAKE QUEENSLAND A MORE INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE STATE. THE SUBMISSION ALSO INCLUDES THE GOLD COAST LIGHT RAIL STAGE 2 ON THE PRIORITY LIST. CURRENTLY THE MAJOR ROADBLOCK TO FUNDING THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN A LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT IT IS A VITALLY IMPORTANT PROJECT TO IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN BRISBANE AND THE GOLD COAST. THE 12 INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN QUEENSLANDS IA SUBMISSION INCLUDE MAJOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND ROAD PROJECTS THROUGH THE STATE THAT WILL UNDERPIN OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOBS INTO THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION TO THE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED FOR INCLUSION ON INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIAS PRIORITY LIST, WE HAVE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED OUR PRELIMINARY WORK ON A RANGE OF OTHER IMPORTANT PROJECTS, INCLUDING NORTH QUEENSLAND INFRASTRUCTURE, WATER INFRASTRUCTURE, AND AVIATION INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE ALSO SOUGHT IAS ADVICE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL INCLUSION OF THE TOWNSVILLE SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT CENTRE ON THE LIST, AS PROJECTS LIKE THIS HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN INCLUDED IN IAS REMIT. MS TRAD SAID THE PALASZCZUK GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO CALLING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING TO DELIVER PROJECTS THAT WILL SUSTAIN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND CREATE A LASTING AND BENEFICIAL LEGACY FOR THE PEOPLE OF QUEENSLAND.

WE ARE GETTING ON WITH THE JOB OF DELIVERING QUEENSLANDS FIRST STATE INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN IN THREE YEARS TO ENSURE THERE IS CERTAINTY FOR INDUSTRY AND OUR STATE DOES NOT MISS OUT ON THE VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THE COMMUNITY NEEDS. IN CONTRAST, UNDER MR ABBOTTS LEADERSHIP CANBERRA RETREATED FROM ITS TRADITIONAL FUNDING RESPONSIBILITIES IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOT A SINGLE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT WAS ANNOUNCED FOR QUEENSLAND IN THE LAST FEDERAL BUDGET. WE REMAIN HOPEFUL THAT THE NEW TURNBULL GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO INVESTING IN CRITICAL PUBLIC TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS -- WHICH WERE IGNORED BY THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER. THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT IA SUBMISSION INCLUDING SEVEN NEW PRIORITY PROJECTS AND FIVE EXISTING PROJECTS FROM THE 2013 INFRASTRUCTURE PRIORITY LIST.

864	KR: RIGHT, THE FETUS CONSTANTLY ADAPTS TO THE WOMB ENVIRONMENT AND PAYS THE PRICE FOR IT. THE FIRST ORDER IS SURVIVE AT ALL COSTS. THEN IF WERE FORTUNATE LATER, POSSIBLY THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO GO BACK AND TAKE CARE OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS, AND ALSO ITS THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO. NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL THEIR PAIN, NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL TERROR OR ANYTHING UNPLEASANT REALLY. THATS WHAT OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE ABOUT, DISTRACTING OURSELVES IN A THOUSAND WAYS FROM ALL THIS PAIN WERE CARRYING AROUND, WHICH KEEPS RELENTLESSLY SURGING TO BE MADE CONSCIOUS. DR. JANOV WRITES, THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA WHILE BEING CARRIED AND IN CHILDHOOD DIE IN AVERAGE TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THOSE RISK FACTORS. SO HERE THIS IS A GOOD ARGUMENT, FOR UNDERSTANDING AND RELIVING AND FEELING OUR PAIN, AND POSSIBLY EVEN HEALING BIG SECTIONS OF OUR HEARTS AND SOULS THAT ARE THERE WAS AN OLD BOOK THAT HE WROTE CALLED PRISONERS OF PAIN. THAT WERE ALL KIND OF HUGGED TIED BY OUR PAIN AND THE REPRESSION THAT WE USE TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE PRICE WE PAY FOR IT. JL: RIGHT, AND I THINK THIS CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF AFFECTS TOO IN TERMS OF HOW WE REPRESS OR HOW WE TRY TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT MANY OF THEM ARE JUST AS BAD IF WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DIG PAST THE PAIN OR REPRESS IT THAT CREATES ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM, WHICH CAN THEN SHOW UP IN OTHER WAYS. THERE HASNT BEEN A LOT OF DEFINITIVE RESEARCH ON THIS, BUT DR. JANOV REALLY BELIEVES THAT THIS ALSO MAY BE BEHIND WHAT EVENTUALLY CAUSES CANCER, THIS SORT OF MASSIVE REPRESSION ON THE CELLULAR LEVEL THAT PREVENTS NATURAL GROWTH AND THEN OVERTIME CREATES CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES. KR: ID LIKE TO READ ANOTHER SHORT SECTION HERE, DR. JANOV WRITES, WHAT MOST OF MEDICINE AND PSYCHOTHERAPY INVOLVES TODAY IS THE TREATMENT OF FRAGMENTS OF THE HUMAN BEING. WE THEN GO ABOUT TREATING THE VARIED OFFSHOOTS FROM A CENTRAL IMPRINT, RATHER THAN THE IMPRINT ITSELF. TREATMENT BECOMES INTERMINABLE, WHAT WE GET IS A FRAGMENT OF PROGRESS, A CHANGE IN  ASPECTS OF AN EARLY EXPERIENCE, RATHER THAN A HOLISTIC RECALIBRATION OR NEURO AND PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS CONNECTED WITH THE EXPERIENCE. JL: RIGHT. I THINK THATS REALLY TO KIND OF TAKE THAT AND KIND OF GO TIED IN WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYING COMPARISONS HE DRAWS IN THE BOOK TO SOMEBODY LIKE FREUD, THE RELATIONSHIP HE HAS WITH SOME OF THE EARLIER OF PSYCHOANALYSIS AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT PRECEDED HIM IS COMPLICATED. FREUD HE HAD THIS NOTION THAT HYSTERIA WAS ROOTED IN REPRESSED SEXUAL DESIRE AND HE OFTEN CHARTED IT IN DREAMS AND SORT OF THIS SYMBOLIC NOTION OF DREAMS. I THINK WHAT JANOV REALLY DOES IS HE TAKES, MUCH LIKE THOSE I THINK, THINKERS WHO DWELLED IN BIG IDEAS AND SORT OF PROFOUND CONCLUSIONS, HE SORT OF NOTES THAT WHILE FREUD WAS WORKING ON THE SYMBOLIC LABELS AND MISSED A LOT, HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS. INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOW THIS HYSTERIA WOULD CONSTANTLY BE UNREFLECTIVE AND PRONE TO OVERREACTION, AND JANOV WOULD SAY YES THESE TRAITS EXIST, BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR SYMBOLS IN DREAMS, HELL LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF WHATS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHEN WERE HAVING NIGHTMARES. WHATS HAPPENING TO US BIOLOGICALLY WHEN WE HAVE A NIGHTMARE, OR WHAT DO WE FEEL DURING THAT TIME, AND WHY IS THAT TERROR COMING UP. HELL LOOK TO THE LIMBIC SYSTEM TO FIND WHERE THE TERROR IS ACTUALLY ROOTED. HES NOT TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THATS GOING TO CALM DOWN A PATIENT WHO HAS ADD OR DEPRESSION FOR THE DAY OR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. EVEN SOMETHING THAT MAINTAINS THE STATUS QUO, HES REALLY LOOKING TO SOMETHING THAT CAN EVENTUALLY PROMOTE A CURE. KR: IM GOING TO READ ONE MORE PARAGRAPH OK? ON MY END DR. JANOV WRITES, THE BRAIN WE NEED TO ADDRESS DOESNT TALK, DOESNT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT DOESNT UNDERSTAND WORDS. IN FACT, THE TERM UNDERSTAND IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER, WE ARE NOT AFTER UNDERSTANDING IN THE INTELLECTUAL SENSE OF THE TERM, WE ARE AFTER INTEGRATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT CEREBRAL UNDERSTANDING.  WHEN A THERAPIST TRIES TO GET A PATIENT TO REPORT ON HIS FEELINGS ALL MAY BE FOR THOSE FEELINGS MAY BE WORDLESS. TRYING TO EXPRESS THEM VERBALLY DISTANCES US FROM THE ORIGINS OF OUR PAIN IN THE LOWER BRAIN, AND SINCE ONE LAYER OF BRAIN TISSUE CANNOT DO THE WORK OF ANOTHER WE HAVE EFFECTIVELY TRUMPED OR EFFORTS, ONCE WE GET AWAY FROM WORDS WE CAN FOCUS ON WHAT IS CURATIVE. UNDERSTANDING CAME LAST IN HUMAN EVOLUTION, LONG AFTER FEELING, AND IT WILL NOT LEAD US TO THE LONG TERM HEALING WE ARE AFTER. NONE OF THIS REQUIRES ABSTRACT OR ESOTERIC METHODS, WE CAN MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN SOCIETY JUST BY PAYING ATTENTION TO GESTATION AND CHANGING OUR BIRTH PRACTICES. JL: RIGHT, AND I MEAN I THINK THATS ONE OF THE BOOKS KEY CONCLUSIONS, IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT BIRTH PRACTICES AND LOOK AT A MOTHERS EMOTIONAL STATE AS NOT JUST NOT AT ALL INCIDENTAL. I THINK THE IDEA THAT FEELING IS CONNECTED TO OUR BIOLOGY AND HAS THESE SORT OF BIOLOGIC IMPLICATIONS, WE CAN SEE IT IN OUR BIOLOGY IS A PRETTY DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE FIELD. A FIELD THAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY TALK THERAPY AND BY APPROACHES REALLY FOCUSED ON ANALYSIS, NOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN. THATS WHERE I THINK DR. JANOV IS REALLY LOOKING TO GO. KR: WELL, IT EXCITES ME BECAUSE I THINK IT OPENS A HUGE DOOR. I THINK IT OPENS AN ENORMOUS DOOR OF UNDERSTANDING AND OF SUGGESTING VERY FUNDAMENTAL, NONE ESOTERIC, AS HE SAYS, SIMPLE BIRTH  PRACTICES, PRACTICES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILD BIRTHING THAT CAN HAVE THE MOST DRAMATIC AND FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR HUMAN FUTURE. IT CAN PROBABLY DO MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE BILLABLE HOURS IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROFESSION. JL: YES, I THINK THERE WAS A CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK THAT CAME ABOUT LATER SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH PREGNANCY, AND I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME WORKING WITH DR. JANOV IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND JUST KIND OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE CONSTANT INFLUX OF NEW IDEAS AND RESEARCH HE WAS EXPOSING ME TO AND ALL THE WORK THAT WAS BEING DONE, IN THE FIELD OF EPIGENETICS AND IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL HEALTH AND NEW STUDIES HE WAS SHOWING ME ABOUT MEMORY AND ANXIETY AND ALL THESE OTHER TOPICS, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK REALLY STUCK WAS THIS IDEA ABOUT WHAT TO DO DURING PREGNANCY. AND HE ENDED UP SORT OF WRITING A CHAPTER ON PREGNANCY AND JUST OFFERING SOME ALMOST CONCRETE PIECES OF ADVICE FOR WOMEN THAT CAN HAVE SOME REALLY LASTING IMPLICATIONS. AS HE WRITES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OXYMORON FOR ME TO GIVE ADVICE SINCE I AM NOT BY PROFESSION NOR INTENTION AN AFICIONADO OF ADVICE. BUT LET US NOT MINIMIZE WHAT A CARRYING MOTHER CAN DO FOR THE GOOD OR BAD OF HER CHILD. IT IS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION THAT HE APPROACHES THE SUBJECT, BECAUSE HE IS MALE AND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT IF YOURE SORT OF PROVIDING SOME GUIDELINES FOR HOW IT BEHAVED. BUT THINGS LIKE WATCHING YOUR STRESS; IF I CAN READ JUST A COUPLE PARTS OF THIS CHAPTER I THINK ITS REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE IS NO WAY TO ELIMINATE STRESS ENTIRELY, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS TO MANAGE IT. DONT PLAN A NEW BUSINESS OR START A SERIES OF COMPLICATED PROJECTS THAT PUT YOU UNDER STRESS WHILE PREGNANT. THE BABY WILL FEEL THIS ANXIETY AND SUFFER. TRY TO WORK OUT PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SPOUSE BEFORE YOU GET PREGNANT. ONCE YOU ARE PREGNANT, IT IS LARGELY TOO LATE. THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD NEVER ARGUE OR FIGHT AGAIN; BUT TRY TO RESOLVE THE MORE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES BEFORE YOU INTRODUCE A NEW LIFE ON THIS PLANET. THE BABY DESERVES HIS OR HER BEST CHANCE AT LIFE, AND WHAT YOU DO DURING PREGNANCY TO MANAGE YOUR STRESS IS IMPORTANT, IN THAT REGARD. HE TALKS ABOUT EATING RIGHT AND GETTING PROTEIN, CALCIUM, FOLIC ACID, FIBER. HE TALKS ABOUT BEING VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT GOING ABOUT TRANQUILIZERS AND PAINKILLERS TO RELIVE ANXIETY. NEW STUDIES ARE COMING OUT ALL THE TIME ON THIS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NEW STUDIES ON THE USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS, THE USE OF TRANQUILIZERS DURING PREGNANCY, AND WERE STILL KIND OF FIGURING OUT WHAT ALL THIS DOES, ULTIMATELY IT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE MOTHER TO KEEP HER EMOTIONS BALANCED BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO SEE WHAT OTHER EFFECTS THIS COULD HAVE DURING GESTATION. I THINK THE MAIN THING HE FOCUSES ON ALL OF THIS IS LOVE. TO TOUCH YOUR EARLY ON, TO BREASTFEED IF YOU CAN, HE SAYS, "READ FRENCH OBSTETRICIAN FREDERIC LEBOYER, WHO POPULARIZED THE PRACTICE OF IMMERSING THE NEWBORN IN A WARM WATER BATH, WITHOUT DRUGS AND WITHOUT BRIGHT LIGHTS. LEBOYER RECOMMENDS THAT THE BABY BE HELD RIGHT AWAY AND FOR A LONG TIME. HE ADVISES AGAINST CUTTING THE UMBILICAL CORD TOO SOON AS THE CHILD'S WITH HIS MOTHER IS VITAL AT THE START OF LIFE." "THERE IS NO GREATER ADVICE I CAN GIVE THAN THIS: BE OPEN, EXPRESSIVE, AND FEELING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. A CARING MOTHER GIVES HER BABY THE BEST CHANCE FOR LONG-TERM WELL-BEING. YES, EVEN IF YOU DON'T EAT THOSE CARROTS AND TOMATOES WHEN YOU SHOULD, WILL HELP.  ALL I ASK IS AWARENESS. THE RESEARCH IS THERE; WE DON'T HAVE TO GUESS ANYMORE." HE'S PUTTING IT OUT THERE, WE HAVE RESEARCH INTO THIS FIELD, WE CAN'T TURN A BLIND EYE TO IT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN.
865	BRADLEY A. AREHEART (UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF LAW) HAS POSTED ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY (ALABAMA LAW REVIEW, FORTHCOMING 2016) ON SSRN. HERE IS THE ABSTRACT: COURTS HAVE INTERPRETED THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA) AND THE PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION ACT (PDA) NOT TO AFFIRMATIVELY REQUIRE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PREGNANT WORKERS. THIS HAS GENERATED PROTEST AND LED ALL THREE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PREGNANCY RIGHTS. THE PREGNANT WORKERS FAIRNESS ACT IS PENDING IN CONGRESS AND HAS DRAWN STRONG VOCAL SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT RECENTLY DECIDED YOUNG V. UPS, WHICH FOUND THE PDA DOES NOT AFFIRMATIVELY REQUIRE PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS. FINALLY, MANY COMMENTATORS HAVE ARGUED IN SUPPORT OF CONSIDERING PREGNANCY A DISABILITY UNDER THE ADA. THIS ARTICLE AGREES SUBSTANTIVELY WITH THE END OF ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY, BUT DISAGREES WITH THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS COMMENTATORS HAVE ADVANCED. IN CONTRAST TO THOSE WHO FAVOR A PREGNANCY-SPECIFIC RIGHT TO ACCOMMODATIONS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH PROPOSALS CREATE RISKS TO WOMENS LONG-TERM EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE. IN PARTICULAR, CHARACTERIZING PREGNANCY AS A DISABILITY OR PREGNANT WOMEN AS A CLASS IN SPECIAL NEED OF ACCOMMODATION POSES A DANGER OF EXPRESSIVE HARMS. CURRENTLY PROPOSED MEASURES MAY REVITALIZE EXCLUSIONARY AND PATERNALISTIC ATTITUDES TOWARD PREGNANT EMPLOYEES, SIGNAL INCAPACITY TO WORK, OR ACTUALLY INCREASE SEX DISCRIMINATION. WE SHOULD THUS CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EXPRESSIVE IMPACT OF PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATION SCHEMES IN LIGHT OF CURRENT SOCIAL NORMS IN WHICH PREGNANT WOMEN ARE GENERALLY SEEN AS CAPABLE OF PRODUCTIVE WORK. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO SECURING PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS THAT WOULD AVOID EXPRESSIVE HARMS AND EMPLOY A GENDER SYMMETRICAL APPROACH. THIS ARTICLES CRITIQUE AND THE QUESTION OF HOW BEST TO ACCOMMODATE PREGNANCY RESONATE ACROSS SEVERAL AREAS OF THE LAW. FOR THOSE WHO STUDY CIVIL RIGHTS, ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY ILLUSTRATES THE EXPRESSIVE PERILS OF RIGHTS CLAIMING. FOR HISTORIANS AND SCHOLARS INTERESTED IN GENDER ISSUES, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A CHANCE TO RECONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF GENDER-ASYMMETRICAL LAWS. FOR FAMILY LAW SCHOLARS, ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY HIGHLIGHTS THE CURRENT CAPACITY OF THE LAW TO RESHAPE WORK/FAMILY BALANCE. TO ASSUME THAT IMPLEMENTING GENDER-ASYMMETRICAL RIGHTS IS THE BEST WAY TO HELP WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE OVERLOOKS THE POTENTIAL OF THE LAW TO AMELIORATE BROADER SOCIAL ISSUES. THESE INCLUDE THE WAY IN WHICH EMPLOYMENT IS TYPICALLY STRUCTURED TO ACCOMMODATE THE MOST PRIVILEGED EMPLOYEES AND HOW EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE ACCOMMODATING WORKPLACES.

867	UPDATE IS YOUR DOCTOR KEEPING A SECRET FROM YOU? IF YOU DONT KNOW YOUR BREAST DENSITY, YOU DONT HAVE ALL THE KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR BREAST HEALTH, SAID NANCY CAPPELLO, A FORMER EDUCATION ADMINISTRATOR FROM WOODBURY, CONNECTICUT, WHO STARTED THE ARE YOU DENSE CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE OTHER WOMEN. CAPPELLO CALLS BREAST DENSITY A BEST-KEPT SECRET. IF YOU HAVE A MAMMOGRAM, YOUR DOCTOR KNOWS YOUR BREAST DENSITY, BUT IS HE SHARING THIS CRITICAL INFORMATION WITH YOU? DEPENDING ON WHICH STATE YOU LIVE IN, THE ANSWER COULD BE NO. NANCYS STORY CAPPELLOS STORY IS SHOCKING. AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF ROUTINE ANNUAL MAMMOGRAMS AND THE HAPPY GRAM REPORTS THAT SHOWED HER RESULTS AS NORMAL WITH NO SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS, CAPPELLO WAS TOLD SHE HAD CANCER WHEN A DOCTOR NOTICED A SUSPICIOUS RIDGE IN HER RIGHT BREAST DURING AN ANNUAL PHYSICAL EXAM.  FROM THE SIZE AND HOW IT METASTASIZED, THE CANCER HAD BEEN GROWING FOR SIX YEARS, CAPPELLO SAID. AS A HEALTHY WOMAN AND EDUCATED PATIENT WHO WATCHED HER WEIGHT, EXERCISED REGULARLY AND NEVER MISSED A MAMMOGRAM APPOINTMENT, CAPPELLO WAS BOWLED OVER TO LEARN SHE HAD ADVANCED BREAST CANCER. THATS WHEN HER DOCTOR TOLD HER ABOUT HER DENSE BREAST TISSUE AND HOW IT CAN HIDE CANCER ON A MAMMOGRAM.  DIRECTED BY SCOTT COOPER ("CRAZY HEART," THE UNDERRATED "OUT OF THE FURNACE"), THE FILM RELIES ON AN ARGUABLY CAREER-BEST PERFORMANCE FROM JOHNNY DEPP AS THE PREDATORY AND AT TIMES TERRIFYING BULGER. I ASKED, WHY WASNT I TOLD I HAVE DENSE BREAST TISSUE? THE RESPONSE WAS THAT ITS NOT STANDARD PROTOCOL TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH TE PATIENT, CAPPELLO SAID. SHE WENT INTO ACTION, AND CONNECTICUT WAS THE FIRST STATE TO PASS A BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAW. WHAT DOES DENSE MEAN? DENSE BREAST TISSUE IS NOT ABNORMAL.  VACATIONING IN VEGAS IS MORE THAN GAMBLING AND SHOWS, AND THESE DAY TRIPS ARE THE PERFECT COMPANION FOR ANY TRIP. ITS JUST THE WAY A WOMAN IS BUILT, SAID DR. KATHRYN EVERS, DIRECTOR OF BREAST IMAGING AT FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER IN PHILADELPHIA. ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS DENSE BREAST TISSUE, WHICH MEANS THAT IT HAS A HIGH PROPORTION OF GLANDULAR OR CONNECTIVE TISSUE. A RADIOLOGIST READS A MAMMOGRAM AND RATES IT IN FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FROM EXTREMELY FATTY TO EXTREMELY DENSE, SAID DR.  IN ADDITION, WEBINAR ATTENDEES WILL LEARN HOW TO USE EMPLOYEE-GENERATED CONTENT TO REPRESENT THEIR EMPLOYER BRAND ACROSS DIFFERENT CHANNELS IN ORDER TO CONVERT MORE PROSPECTS INTO CANDIDATES. EMILY F. CONANT, PROFESSOR AND CHIEF, DIVISION OF BREAST IMAGING, DEPARTMENT OF RADIOLOGY, HOSPITAL OF THE UNIVERSITY  OF PENNSYLVANIA.  WORKING IN AUTOFOCUS MODE WITH AF TRACKING AND CONTINUOUS SHOOTINGWAS VERY EASY! TEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE HAVE ENTIRELY FATTY BREAST TISSUE AND 12 PERCENT HAVE EXTREMELY DENSE BREAST TISSUE. THE OTHER 80 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS BROKEN DOWN EVENLY BETWEEN SCATTERED FIBROGLANDULAR (FATTY) TISSUE AND HETEROGENEOUSLY DENSE.  THAT EXERCISE IS SOMETIMES WASTED HERE, AS THE EVENTS AND SCREENPLAY BY TAYLOR SHERIDAN DONT HAVE THE HEFT OR THE COHESION TO SURVIVE A TWO-PLUS HOUR DRAMA . DENSE BREAST TISSUE CAMOUFLAGES TUMORS ON A MAMMOGRAM, EVERS SAID. FATTY TISSUE SHOWS UP GREYISH BLACK ON  A MAMMOGRAM, MAKING IT STAND OUT. DENSE TISSUE LOOKS WHITE. BREAST MASSES OR TUMORS ALSO APPEAR WHITE ON A MAMMOGRAM, MAKING THEM HARD  OR IMPOSSIBLE TO SPOT IN DENSE BREASTS. PAGE 2 OF 3 - BREAST DENSITY VARIES BY AGE AND WEIGHT, CONANT SAID. AS WOMEN AGE THEIR BREASTS BECOME LESS DENSE. WOMEN WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE OFTEN HAVE DENSER BREASTS. NOT ONLY CAN DENSE BREAST TISSUE HIDE CANCER ON A MAMMOGRAM, THERE IS SOME INCREASED RISK FOR BREAST CANCER FOR WOMEN WITH DENSE BREASTS, EVERS SAID. ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO TELL IF YOUR BREASTS ARE DENSE BY SIGHT OR FEEL. ITS NOT A MATTER OF A BREAST FEELING FIRM OR LUMPY, EVERS SAID.  WAS FORMED TO PROVIDE A SUPPORT ORGANIZATION AND FORUM FOR THE ADVANCEMENT AND ADOPTION OF USB TECHNOLOGY AS DEFINED IN THE USB SPECIFICATIONS. BREAST DENSITY CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY A MAMMOGRAM, SAID. INFORMATION VS. EXPENSE ND THATS WHERE A BIT OF CONTROVERSY COMES IN, CONANT SAID. TWENTY-FOUR STATES HAVE LAWS THAT REQUIRE HEALTH FACILITIES TO NOTIFY WOMEN IF THEY HAVE DENSE BREASTS. ELEVEN OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING BREAST DENSITY NOTIFICATION LAWS,  AND NATIONWIDE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS. A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW AND DESERVES TO BE EDUCATED SO SHE CAN MAKE INFORMED HEALTH-CARE CHOICES AND POSSIBLY SEEK ADDITIONAL SCREENING METHODS, CAPPELLO SAID. THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT, THOUGH, IS WARY OF CREATING PANIC AND ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO SEEK OUT COSTLY ADDITIONAL SCREENING TESTS, CONANT SAID.  ELEVEN MILLION VEHCLES WITH THE 'DEFEAT DEVICES' WERE SOLD WORLDWIDE AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE THOUGHT TO BE ON BRITAIN'S ROADS. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW THEIR BREAST DENSITY, CONANT SAYS. BUT TELLING WOMEN CAUSES FRUSTRATION BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THERE ARE RISKS AND BENEFITS TO MAMMOGRAMS, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE NEGATIVES. FOR A WOMAN WITH DENSE BREASTS, AN ULTRASOUND IS A COMPLEMENTARY SCREENING, CONANT SAID: USED WITH MAMMOGRAMS, ULTRASOUNDS MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING BREAST CANCER BUT THEY COME WITH MANY FALSE NEGATIVES AND POSITIVES. AN MRI IS A VERY GOOD TOOL. IT FINDS MORE CANCERS THAN A MAMMOGRAM AND HAS SLIGHTLY FEWER FALSE POSITIVES THAN A MAMMOGRAM, CONANT SAID. BUT MRIS CAN COST THOUSANDS, AND INSURANCE WONT COVER IT IN THE CASE OF A WOMAN WHO HAS DENSE BREASTS AND NO OTHER HIGH-RISK FACTORS.  ITS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE HAVING. THE BENEFITS OF 6-D MAMMOGRAMS INCLUDE THE ABILITY FOR THE RADIOLOGIST TO ZOOM IN, MAGNIFY AND CHANGE THE CONTRAST OF THE BREAST IMAGE AND VIEW IT IN SLICES FOR MORE PRECISE IMAGES, FLEXIBLE PLATES FOR GREATER COMFORT AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FALSE POSITIVES. ADVICE THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY RECOMMENDS WOMEN GET AN ANNUAL MAMMOGRAM STARTING AT AGE 40, CONTINUING AS LONG AS A WOMANS IN GOOD HEALTH. AS A WOMAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOUR DOCTOR, CAPPELLO SAID. THE INFORMATION SHOULD NEVER BE HIDDEN. FIND OUT YOUR BREAST DENSITY AND WHAT IMPACT IT CAN HAVE ON YOUR BREAST HEALTH.

868	FALL LEAF COLOR IN THE MOUNTAINS OF WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD BE THE BEST IT HAS BEEN IN A NUMBER OF YEARS BECAUSE OF GENERALLY DRIER-THAN-NORMAL CONDITIONS DURING 2015. THATS THE WORD FROM WESTERN CAROLINA UNIVERSITYS AUTUMNAL SEASON SAGE KATHY MATHEWS IN HER ANNUAL PREDICTION OF HOW FOLIAGE AROUND THE REGION WILL PERFORM AS THE SUNLIGHT OF SUMMER WANES AND DAYS BECOME FROSTY. MATHEWS, AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY AT WCU, SPECIALIZES IN PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND BASES HER COLOR FORECAST ON BOTH PAST AND PREDICTED WEATHER CONDITIONS. SHE BELIEVES THAT THE FORMATION OF HIGHER LEVELS OF PIGMENTS IN THE LEAVES CORRELATES WITH DRY WEATHER THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, BUT ESPECIALLY AS FALL COMES AROUND THE BEND. THIS FALL COULD BE ONE OF THE BEST LEAF COLOR SEASONS IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA IN RECENT MEMORY, MATHEWS SAID. THREE WORDS EXPLAIN IT UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER. U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE REGION HAD BEEN DRIER THAN NORMAL FOR MOST OF THE YEAR, BUT WITH ENOUGH RAIN, PARTICULARLY IN THE MONTHS OF APRIL AND JUNE, TO AVOID DROUGHT AND KEEP THE TREES HEALTHY, SHE SAID. SUGAR CONCENTRATIONS IN THE LEAVES INCREASE DURING DRY WEATHER BECAUSE THE TREES ARE NOT TAKING UP AS MUCH WATER THROUGH THEIR ROOTS, MATHEWS SAID. THE ABUNDANCE OF SUGARS LEADS TO THE PRODUCTION OF MORE ANTHOCYANINS, THE RED PIGMENTS THAT APPEAR WHEN GREEN CHLOROPHYLLS BEGIN RECEDING. THATS WHAT CAUSES THE LEAF COLORS TO REALLY POP, ALONG WITH THE SIMULTANEOUS APPEARANCE OF ORANGE AND YELLOW PIGMENTS ON THE SAME OR DIFFERENT TREE SPECIES, SHE SAID. SOME FOLIAGE FANS MAY BE WONDERING IF THE MUCH-PUBLICIZED EL NINO WEATHER PATTERN MAY AFFECT THE FALL COLORS. METEOROLOGISTS ARE PREDICTING A LIGHT HURRICANE SEASON IN THE ATLANTIC THIS YEAR, PARTLY BECAUSE OF DRY AIR OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO AND CARIBBEAN CAUSED BY EL NINO, AND THAT REDUCES THE CHANCES OF HEAVY RAIN AND BIG WIND STORMS IN THE MOUNTAINS IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER GOOD NEWS FOR THE LEAF DISPLAY, MATHEWS SAID. LEAF-PEEPERS ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW WHEN THE PEAK COLOR WILL HAPPEN, BUT THE TIMING OF THE COLOR CHANGE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE DECREASING AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT THAT COMES WITH THE PASSING DAYS, PLUS THE ELEVATION OF A PARTICULAR LOCATION, SHE SAID. THE PEAK OF FALL COLOR OFTEN ARRIVES DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND WEEK OF OCTOBER IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS, ABOVE 4,000 FEET, AND DURING THE THIRD WEEK OF OCTOBER IN THE MID-ELEVATIONS, 2,500 TO 3,500 FEET, MATHEWS SAID. VISITORS CAN LOOK FOR LEAVES TO BE PEAKING IN COLOR INTENSITY A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FIRST REPORTED FROST IN ANY PARTICULAR AREA, SHE SAID. REGARDLESS OF ALL THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT LEAF COLOR, VISITORS TO WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA ALWAYS WILL FIND A PLEASING LEAF DISPLAY SOMEWHERE IN THE MOUNTAINS FROM SEPTEMBER INTO NOVEMBER, WITH A WIDE RANGE OF COLOR MADE POSSIBLE BY THE REGIONS ELEVATIONS RANGING FROM 1,500 FEET TO OVER 6,000 FEET AND THE MORE THAN 100 TREE SPECIES, MATHEWS SAID. KATHY MATHEWS
869	HIS NECK FELT AS IF IT WAS ON FIRE. THAT SENSATION THEN BEGAN TO ENGULF HIS FACE AND HEAD. WHEN CHAD JACKSON REACHED HIS HAND UP TO FEEL AROUND, HE NOTICED THE BLOOD GUSHING FROM WHERE THE BULLET PIERCED THE SKIN OF HIS NECK. AN AVID HUNTER WHO HAS SHOT ANIMALS IN A SIMILAR SPOT, ONLY ONE THING RUSHED THROUGH HIS MIND: JACKSON, FROM WOLCOTTVILLE, REGALED A JURY OF 12 IN AN ALLEN SUPERIOR COURTROOM ON MONDAY ABOUT A NIGHT LAST YEAR THAT BEGAN AS AN EVENING OUT WATCHING MARCH MADNESS WITH FRIENDS AT A BAR AND ENDED WITH HIM FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM. HE TOLD THE JURY ABOUT THE EERIE FEELING IN THE ER, HOW THE DOCTORS AND NURSES CUT AWAY HIS CLOTHES, HOW HE GLIMPSED A FEW POLICE OFFICERS TAKING NOTES AND HOW AT ONE POINT SOMEBODY TOLD SOMEONE ELSE TO GET THE CHAPLAIN THERE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. NOBODY WOULD TELL ME IF I WAS ALL RIGHT, JACKSON SAID. IN THE SAME COURTROOM, MERELY FEET AWAY, SAT 36-YEAR-OLD JEREMY WASHINGTON, THE MAN ACCUSED OF NOT ONLY SHOOTING JACKSON BUT OF ALSO KILLING A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHOSE CAR HE SLAMMED INTO WHILE FLEEING THE SCENE OF THE CORNER POCKET PUB THAT NIGHT MORE THAN A YEAR AGO. WASHINGTONS SCHEDULED 10-DAY TRIAL ON ONE COUNT OF MURDER IN THE DEATH OF BISHOP DWENGER SOPHOMORE HALEY NELLUM AND THREE COUNTS OF ATTEMPTED MURDER FOR SHOOTING AT THREE PEOPLE AS WELL AS A SLEW OF OTHER COUNTS LIKE CRIMINAL RECKLESSNESS AND DRUNKEN DRIVING WENT INTO ITS SIXTH DAY WITH TESTIMONY FROM A DETECTIVE, A CRASH RECREATION EXPERT, A BAR OWNER AND JACKSON. AND WHILE ITS UNLIKELY WASHINGTON WILL TESTIFY LATER, THE JURY GOT TO HEAR HIS WORDS AND SEE HIS MANNERISMS IN A INTERVIEW WITH FORT WAYNE POLICE DETECTIVES TAPED SHORTLY AFTER HE RAN A RED LIGHT AT STELLHORN AND HOBSON ROADS AND COLLIDED AT MORE THAN 100 MPH WITH NELLUMS CAR. IN THE INTERVIEW, WASHINGTON REPEATEDLY CLAIMS THAT FRIENDS OF JACKSONS APPROACHED HE AND OTHERS AT THE CORNER POCKET PUB TRYING TO START A FIGHT OR PROVOKE THEM INTO AN ALTERCATION. AFTER EVERYONE INVOLVED WAS KICKED OUT OF THE BAR, THERE WAS ANOTHER ALTERCATION IN THE PARKING LOT. WASHINGTON CLAIMS IN THE INTERVIEW WITH POLICE THAT SOMEONE IN AN SUV IN WHICH JACKSON AND HIS FRIENDS WERE IN FIRED SHOTS AT HIM IN HIS CAR. WASHINGTON, WHO HAS A VALID GUN PERMIT, SAID ON THE VIDEO THAT HE REACHED IN BETWEEN HIS SEATS TO RETRIEVE HIS SIG SAUER NIGHTMARE .45-CALIBER HANDGUN AND SQUEEZED OFF BETWEEN ONE AND EIGHT ROUNDS IN AN ATTEMPT TO SCARE THOSE IN THE SUV. I SHOT AWAY FROM THEM, HE SAID ON THE VIDEO. I SHOT AT AN ANGLE DOWNWARD TO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. WASHINGTON ALSO SAID IN THE VIDEO HE MEANT TO FIRE ONLY TWICE BUT PROBABLY FIRED MORE TIMES THAN THAT BECAUSE HE PANICKED. THATS WHEN HE TOOK OFF TO GET AWAY FROM THE SUV, CLAIMING IN THE INTERVIEW HE THOUGHT THE SUV WAS FOLLOWING HIM. AT ONE POINT, THE DETECTIVE INFORMED HIM THAT THE SUV WAS ACTUALLY RACING TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE JACKSON HAD BEEN HIT IN THE NECK. SO FAR, NO EVIDENCE OR TESTIMONY DURING THE TRIAL HAS REVEALED ANYONE IN THE SUV WITH JACKSON FIRED ANY SHOTS. IN HIS RECOLLECTION ON THE VIDEO, WASHINGTON AT FIRST SAYS HE NEVER SAW THE RED LIGHT HE RAN, THEN AT ONE POINT SAYS HE TRIED TO APPLY THE BRAKES OF HIS CAR ONCE HE SAW NELLUMS CAR BEGIN CROSSING THE INTERSECTION, THOUGH IT WAS TOO LATE. THE IMPACT OF THE CRASH SENT NELLUMS CAR FLIPPING OVER MULTIPLE TIMES AND PUSHED THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR PAST THE CENTER CONSOLE, ACCORDING TO COURT DOCUMENTS AND TESTIMONY. WHEN ASKED BY A DETECTIVE HOW FAST HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING, WASHINGTON SAID MAYBE 60 MPH. THE CRASH ALSO LEFT A PASSENGER RIDING WITH WASHINGTON IN SERIOUS CONDITION. I WAS TRYING TO GET AWAY, WASHINGTON TELLS THE DETECTIVE IN THE VIDEO. I WAS TRYING TO SAVE US. LATER, HE ADDS: IT WASNT MY INTENTION TO RUN INTO A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL. I WAS SHOT AT. I PANICKED. I WAS TRYING TO GET AWAY. PROVING THAT HE KNOWINGLY USED HIS CAR IN A WAY THAT WOULD LEAD TO SOMEONE GETTING KILLED IS THE CRUX OF THE CASE ALLEN COUNTY PROSECUTORS ARE PRESENTING IN AN ATTEMPT TO PUT THE MURDER CONVICTION ON WASHINGTON. MEANWHILE, THEY ALSO NEED TO PROVE HE INTENDED TO KILL JACKSON AND HIS FRIENDS BY FIRING AT THEM. JACKSON, FOR HIS PART, DID NOT WITNESS THE ARGUMENTS BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND HIS BUDDIES THAT NIGHT AND SAYS HE ENDED UP AT THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME WHEN A MAN HE NEVER EVEN KNEW DECIDED TO FIRE BULLETS IN HIS DIRECTION. TODAY, THE SCAR TISSUE ON HIS NECK BEGINS TO ACHE IF HE DOES ANY PHYSICAL EXERTION, BUT HES UP AND WALKING AND LIVING LIFE THANKS TO THE BULLET MISSING ALL HIS MAJOR ARTERIES BEFORE IT BECAME LODGED IN THE BACK OF HIS NECK WHERE DOCTORS COULD REMOVE IT. (A DOCTOR) SAID I WAS FORTUNATE, HE SAID MONDAY. I CALL IT BLESSED.

THE FIRST GUEST BLOGGER IS LAUREN, WHOSE BLOG, POST GRAD IN PROGRESS, I FOUND THROUGH A LINK UP. SHE'S SUPER SWEET AND YOU'LL LOVE HER! HELLO, HELLO, THANKS SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME JULIE! IFEEL PRETTY HONORED, HUMBLED,ANDTHRILLEDBY JULIE'S GRACIOUS INVITATION FOR ME TO GUEST BLOG WHILE SHE'S AWAY. BUT BEFORE I GET AHEAD OF MYSELF LET'S START WITH AN INTRODUCTION. HI, I'M THE POST GRAD AND I BLOG AT POST GRAD IN PROGRESS. BUT MY NAME IS LAUREN AND I'M A NEW GRADUATE NAVIGATING THROUGH THE REAL WORLD TRYING TO DIG DEEP INTO WHAT MAKES ME TICK.THE REAL WORLD FOR ME BEING, MOVING TO A NEW CITY, STARTING A NEW JOB, AND MOLDING NEW FRIENDSHIPS ALONG THE WAY. MY BLOG IS MY HAPPY PLACE. IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT LIKE MY FAVORITE ANTHROPOLOGIE HACK COASTERS, WRITE RECIPES LIKE MY DELICIOUS MEATLOAF, AND DETAIL MY TRAVELS: RUSSIA, SAN DIEGO (PART 1), SAN DIEGO (PART 2), AND MY NEW ADVENTURE OF EAT, PRAY, LOVING IT IN EUROPE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGERS, ERIKA, DOES THIS SERIES OWNING IT WHERE YOU TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR QUIRKS AND WHAT MAKES YOU, WELL, YOU. EVERY TIME I READ A NEW POST ON A NEW BLOGGER I RACK MY BRAIN OF WHAT I DO THAT IS UNIQUE TO ME. ALAS, THIS MAKES THE PERFECT GUEST POST. I BASICALLY GET ALL MY JUNK ON THE TABLE FROM THE GET-GO! THIS COULD GO ONE OF TWO WAYS...SOME PEOPLE WILL RELATE OR JUST LAUGH AT MY CRAZINESS OR SOME PEOPLE MIGHT RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BUT HEY, I'MOWNINGIT. TODAY AND EVERYDAY. HI I'M LAUREN. 22 YEARS OLD AND I STILL SLEEP WITH MY BABY "BLANKET." YES, I PUT BLANKET IN QUOTATIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY, IT ISN'T A BLANKET ANYMORE. HE IS THEREMNANTOF A FORMER BLANKET TIED TOGETHER IN A RAG. ALSO, YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT I REFER TO MY BLANKET AS "HE" BECAUSE HE JUST ALWAYS HAS BEEN. WEIRD, I KNOW. I CALL HIM "T" BECAUSE MY BABYSITTER CALLED HIM MY TRANQUILIZER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND IT STUCK. HE'S A SENSE OF COMFORT AND MAY I SAY, AWELL-TRAVELEDBLANKET. GOOD GRACIOUS, I'VE LOST HALF OF JULIE'S READERS BY THIS POINT. I'M THE CLUMSIEST PERSON YOU'LL MEET BUT I'VE NEVER BROKEN A BONE AND I'VE NEVER HAD STITCHES. PICTURE ME KNOCKING ON WOOD AT THIS MOMENT. RAW POTATOES GIVE ME THE HEEBIE JEEBIES. I LOVE THE TASTE OF POTATOES...FRENCH FRIES, BAKED POTATOES, SCALLOPED POTATOES...BUT RAW POTATOES FREAK. ME. OUT. MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY SMELL LIKE DIRT AND THEY CAN GROW ROOTS WHEN THEY SIT IN YOUR PANTRY TOO LONG. MY SKIN CRAWLS THINKING ABOUT IT. P.S. JUST POTATOES NOT SWEET POTATOES.I'M STRANGE. I CRY AT THE DROP OF THE HAT. ONEYOUTUBEVIDEO OF A SOLDIER REUNITING WITH HIS FAMILY AND I'M DUNZO. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE, I CRY LAUGHING SO EASILY. IT'S BORDERLINE EMBARRASSING BECAUSE ONCE I GET GOING I CAN'T STOP. ALSO, MY CRYING LAUGHING DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE WHERE I AM. MY COWORKERS HAVE SEEN ME CRYING LAUGHING WAY TOO MANY TIMES. WHEN I WAS IN 2ND GRADE AND MY FAMILY WENT TO JAMAICA I DECIDED IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO GET MY ENTIRE HEAD BRAIDED. I JUST GOT GLASSES, I BURN EASILY, AND I WAS GOING THROUGH AN AWKWARD STAGE SO LET'S JUST SAY THOSE PICTURES ARE ROUGH. BUT MY FRIENDS AND I GET A KICK OUT OF THEM. I THINK ILL STOP THERE. I WANT TO KEEP SOME OF MY CARDS CLOSE TO MY CHEST[SYMBOL]. BUT WEIRDNESS ASIDE, IM A GIRL WHO LOVES GOD, HER FAMILY & FRIENDS, BEING CREATIVE, AND TRAVELING.

I ALWAYS LOVE LEARNING MORE ABOUT MY BLOGGER FRIENDS. I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOUR VERY OWN EAT, PRAY, LOVE ADVENTURE NEXT MONTH!
872	SIMON ARSENEAU MULTIMEDIA JOURNALIST DEBRA SILVERMAN HAS A MASTERS DEGREE IN CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY, HOWEVER HER WORK ALSO INCORPORATES HER KNOWLEDGE OF ASTROLOGY. BOTH A PRACTICING THERAPIST AND AN ASTROLOGER, SILVERMAN WILL BE COMING TO LLOYDMINSTER TO DO TEACHING FOR A CLASS OF ABOUT 20 WOMEN AT VIVID HAIR & ESTHETICS, AND TO DO SESSIONS FOR PEOPLE, FAMILIES, AND THEIR CHILDREN, TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND AND FALL IN LOVE WITH WHO THEY ARE. SILVERMAN WAS PREVIOUSLY IN LLOYDMINSTER THIS PAST JUNE, AND COMES TO THE AREA ON A REGULAR BASIS HAVING CREATED GOOD FRIENDSHIPS IN THE AREA. IVE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE LEVEL OF COMMUNITY AND THE LEVEL OF INTEREST AND THE SENSE OF FAMILY VALUES THAT PEOPLE HAVE, SILVERMAN SAID. I JUST LOVE WORKING IN CANADA. ITS VERY DIFFERENT THAN AMERICANS, I FIND CANADIANS MUCH FRESHER, MUCH HEALTHIER. SILVERMAN CURRENTLY LIVES IN COLORADO, BUT SPENT 20 YEARS IN VANCOUVER AND STUDIED IN TORONTO. SHE CONSIDERS HERSELF HALF AMERICAN AND HALF CANADIAN, AND HAS STATUS IN BOTH COUNTRIES. COMPARING THE TWO COUNTRIES, SILVERMAN SAID AMERICANS CAN GET OVERWHELMED ABOUT SPIRITUALITY AND METAPHYSICS, WHEREAS IN LLOYDMINSTER THERE IS MORE OF A RECEPTIVITY. SILVERMAN HAS SPENT OVER 37 YEARS USING HER EDUCATION IN PSYCHOLOGY AND HER KNOWLEDGE OF ASTROLOGY TO HELP PEOPLE GOING THROUGH MAJOR LIFE CHANGES. WHILE DOING A PRESENTATION IN SEDONA, ARIZONA, SHE MET SPEAKER BONNIE WIRTH FROM LLOYDMINSTER WHO ACTS AS SILVERMANS PARTNER WHEN SHE COMES TO THE BORDER CITY. WE TEACH TOGETHER AND SHE SETS UP THE CLASSES, AND WE HAVE A REALLY GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP, SILVERMAN SAID. IN HER WORKSHOPS SILVERMAN TEACHES ABOUT FOUR PERSONALITY TYPES EXEMPLIFIED BY WATER, AIR, EARTH, AND FIRE. WATER PEOPLE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT TALK VERY MUCH, BUT FEEL A LOT; AIR PEOPLE READ, WRITE, AND ARE MORE EXTROVERTED; EARTH PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE PRACTICAL AND SPEND TIME ORGANIZING AND CHECKING THINGS OFF THEIR LIST; AND FIRE PEOPLE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOW OFF MORE, SUCH AS PEOPLE WHO WORK IN ENTERTAINMENT OR SPORTS. I DESCRIBE THESE FOUR PERSONALITY TYPES, AND ASSIST PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEYRE DIFFERENT AND THEN TO ACCEPT THE DIFFERENCES, SILVERMAN SAID. AS A THERAPIST SILVERMAN WAS TRAINED IN A CLASSICAL UNIVERSITY SETTING, WHICH DOES NOT ENCOURAGE ASTROLOGY, YET TODAY ONE OF HER SKILLS IS DEMYSTIFYING ANY MISCONCEPTIONS PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE ABOUT ASTROLOGY. SHE SAID SHE HAS DEMYSTIFIED THE OLD CONCEPTS THAT IT IS A USELESS OR SUPERFICIAL SCIENCE, AND HAS ADDED SOME QUALITY TO IT THAT MAKES PEOPLE INTERESTED BECAUSE SHE SAID IT REALLY DOES HELP. FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS SILVERMAN HAS BEEN SHARING HER KNOWLEDGE EVERY TUESDAY THROUGH HER RADIO SHOW TELL ME A STORY, WHICH IS AVAILABLE ONLINE ON HER WEBSITE AT HTTPS://DEBRASILVERMANASTROLOGY.COM/ASTROLOGY-RADIO/. SHE PREVIOUSLY WORKED ON ANOTHER RADIO SHOW WHILE LIVING IN VANCOUVER, AND SHE SAID SHE LOVES BEING ABLE TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE VIA THE AIRWAVES. ITS A GREAT CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO LIFT PEOPLES SPIRITS AND HAVE THEM UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES, SILVERMAN SAID. SILVERMAN WILL BE IN LLOYDMINSTER FROM FRIDAY, SEPT. 11 TO TUESDAY, SEPT. 15. HER CLASS AT VIVID HAIR & ESTHETICS IS CLOSED, BUT SHE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR SESSIONS ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AT THE HOME OF BONNIE WIRTH. PRICES FOR SESSIONS RANGE FROM $250 TO $350. FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT BONNIE WIRTH AT 1-877-487-8878 OR ONLINE AT PUREBYBONNIE@GMAIL.COM. MY PASSION IS TO HELP PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE WITH THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAITH, AND JUST FALL IN LOVE WITH THEIR LIFE, SILVERMAN SAID. THATS MY JOB. @BOOSTERARSENEAU

876	MISCAST AS A TIGHT END, NEBRASKA'S FREEDOM AKINMOLADUN LOOKS LIKE A STAR IN THE MAKING AT DEFENSIVE END. THE REDSHIRT FRESHMAN HAS A TEAM-LEADING FOUR SACKS THROUGH FOUR GAMES, INCLUDING TWO IN SATURDAY'S 36-28 WIN OVER SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI. THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS HIS TAKEDOWN OF NICK MULLENS AT MIDFIELD TO END THE GAME. THE PREVIOUS COACHING STAFF HAD RECRUITED AKINMOLADUN AS A TIGHT END, AND THAT'S WHERE HE WORKED ON THE SCOUT TEAM LAST SEASON. AKINMOLADUN COULDN'T GET COMFORTABLE, AND WHEN MIKE RILEY'S STAFF ARRIVED, HE REQUESTED A MOVE TO DEFENSIVE END. GIVEN NEBRASKA'S SHORTAGE OF PERSONNEL ON THE DEFENSIVE LINE, COORDINATOR MARK BANKER WAS FINE WITH THE SWITCH. "HE JUST CONTINUES TO GRIND AWAY, LISTEN TO THE COACHING POINTS, PLAYS WITHIN THE SCHEME OF THINGS, WORKS ON HIS TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES, AND HE'S COMING ALONG," BANKER SAID. AKINMOLADUN'S RAPID PROGRESS IS ONE OF THE FEW BRIGHT SPOTS FOR A MALIGNED AND INJURY-PLAGUED UNIT THAT RANKS 103RD IN THE COUNTRY IN TOTAL DEFENSE AND 128TH AND LAST IN PASSING YARDS ALLOWED. AKINMOLADUN MADE HIS FIRST START THREE GAMES AGO. HE REPLACED SENIOR JACK GANGWISH, WHO DISLOCATED HIS ELBOW ON THE LAST PLAY OF THE OPENER AGAINST BYU. "I'M REALLY PROUD OF FREEDOM," GANGWISH SAID. "HE'S REALLY STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE. HE'S ONLY BEEN A D-END FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW, BUT HE'S BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB. FREEDOM HAD PLAYED TIGHT END ON SCOUT TEAM, SO AS A D-END I WAS FACE-TO-FACE WITH HIM A LOT. SO I ALREADY HAD AN IDEA OF HIS COMPETITIVENESS AND ATHLETICISM." THE 6-FOOT-4, 255-POUND AKINMOLADUN HAS BEEN SO GOOD THAT BANKER CAN'T PROMISE GANGWISH WILL GET HIS STARTING JOB BACK. BANKER SAID HIS CHALLENGE TO AKINMOLADUN IS THIS: "GO WIN A SHIRT, GO WIN A SHIRT. AND HE'S CERTAINLY CLOSE TO DOING THAT." BANKER WAS REFERRING TO A BLACK SHIRT, THE PRACTICE JERSEY TRADITIONALLY WORN BY NEBRASKA'S DEFENSIVE STARTERS. AKINMOLADUN'S DESIRE TO BECOME A DOMINANT DEFENSIVE END SHOWED WHEN HE STARTED WORKING AT THE POSITION IN THE SPRING. HE SAID HE ASKED DEFENSIVE LINE COACH HANK HUGHES "PROBABLY 3,000 QUESTIONS" ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME WITH DEFENSIVE TACKLE MALIEK COLLINS STUDYING VIDEO. AKINMOLADUN SAID HE PLANNED TO SPEND A GOOD PORTION OF SUNDAY BREAKING DOWN THE SOUTHERN MISS GAME WITH COLLINS. "WE'LL GO DOWN THE LIST, SEEING WHAT WE DID RIGHT AND WRONG. IT HELPS A LOT," AKINMOLADUN SAID. AKINMOLADUN SAID COLLINS' PRESENCE ALONGSIDE HIM ALLOWED HIM MAKE THE LAST-PLAY SACK ON SATURDAY. SOUTHERN MISS' OFFENSIVE LINE PAID EXTRA ATTENTION TO COLLINS, AND AKINMOLADUN SLIPPED AROUND THE LEFT TACKLE TO GET MULLENS AND BRING HIM DOWN. "I THINK I JUST GOT OFF THE BALL AND THE TACKLE WAS SO FOCUSED ON MALIEK COLLINS," AKINMOLADUN SAID, "AND I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY."
877	(CNN) - IT'S A PERFECT FALL DAY AS OUR VAN MAKES THE 30-MINUTE DRIVE FROM CENTRAL PYONGYANG TO JANG CHON COOPERATIVE FARM. WE ASK IF OUR PHOTOGRAPHER CAN FILM OUT OF THE WINDOW AS WE PASS THE ROLLING FIELDS THAT WILL SOON BE READY TO HARVEST. "NOT YET," ONE OFFICIAL TELLS US. "WE'RE ALMOST THERE." WHEN IT COMES TO FARMING IN NORTH KOREA, SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER ARE TYPICALLY THE MOST ABUNDANT MONTHS. FROM WHAT WE'RE SEEING, FARMS ARE BUSY. WINTER IS COMING AND NORTH KOREANS WILL SOON STOCK UP ON KOREAN CABBAGE USED TO MAKE KIMCHI, THE DELICIOUS FERMENTED SIDE DISH THAT IS A STAPLE OF THE KOREAN DIET YEAR-ROUND, BUT ESPECIALLY DURING THE WINTER MONTHS. SOME WILL USE HUNDREDS OF HEADS OF CABBAGE IN THE ANNUAL KIMCHI MAKING RITUAL, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO LAST THROUGH WINTER INTO SPRING. FOR MANY, A WEAK HARVEST MEANS LESS FOOD, ESPECIALLY IN MAY JUST BEFORE BARLEY SEASON. AS WE PULL INTO THE CO-OP FARM, WE SPOT THE ROWS OF GREENHOUSES THAT NORTH KOREA HOPES WILL REDUCE AND ELIMINATE SEASONAL FOOD SHORTAGES THAT CONTINUE TO AFFECT LARGE PORTIONS OF THE POPULATION. WE SPOT A LARGE, COLORFUL MURAL OF NORTH KOREAN FOUNDER KIM IL SUNG, A MAN WHOSE PORTRAIT IS OMNIPRESENT IN EVERY HOME AND PUBLIC BUILDING. KIM, WHO STILL HOLDS THE TITLE OF ETERNAL PRESIDENT MORE THAN 20 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH, IS PORTRAYED ON THE MURAL WEARING HIS TRADEMARK SUIT STANDING IN A CABBAGE FIELD AMONGST SMILING FARMERS. THE MURAL IS ALMOST THE ONLY RECOGNIZABLE FEATURE OF THE ORIGINAL COOPERATIVE FARMING VILLAGE, WHICH RECENTLY UNDERWENT A DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION. THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED ON THE ORDERS OF SUPREME LEADER KIM JONG UN -- THE CURRENT KIM -- WHO ENVISIONED A FARM OF THE FUTURE. AN AVERAGE OF 4,000 WORKERS PER DAY, INCLUDING TROOPS FROM THE KOREAN PEOPLE'S ARMY, WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK, EVEN DURING THE HARSH WINTER MONTHS, TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT AT "CHOLLIMA SPEED," A REFERENCE TO THE MYTHICAL WINGED HORSE THAT SYMBOLIZES THE RAPID ADVANCE OF KOREAN SOCIETY. MODEL VILLAGE WITH ALL THOSE RESOURCES POURED INTO IT, THE IMPROVEMENTS GO FAR BEYOND THE SPRAWLING, IRRIGATED FIELDS AND THE SEA OF 665 GREENHOUSES. THERE ARE ROWS OF BRAND NEW HOUSING UNITS, COMPLETE WITH SPACIOUS APARTMENTS WITH NEW KITCHENS, PATIOS, AND PRIVATE BATHROOMS. COOKING IS DONE OUTSIDE USING PROPANE GAS IN THE WARMER MONTHS, AND INSIDE ON BURNERS BUILT INTO THE FLOOR DURING THE COLD SEASON. LIKE MOST NORTH KOREAN HOMES TODAY, THERE ARE NUMEROUS SOLAR PANELS TO REDUCE THE DRAIN ON THE NATION'S POWER GRID AND PROVIDE BACKUP POWER DURING FREQUENT ELECTRICITY SHORTAGES. WE VISIT A NEWLY BUILT NURSERY SCHOOL THAT HAS A MEDICAL CLINIC, SPRING WATER BATHING ROOM, INDOOR AND OUTDOOR WADING POOLS, MUSIC INSTRUCTION AND PLAYROOMS FULL OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND TOY MISSILE LAUNCHERS, MINI-VERSIONS OF THE LARGER MILITARY HARDWARE THAT WILL ROLL THROUGH THE STREETS OF PYONGYANG FOR THE UPCOMING OCTOBER 10 PARTY FOUNDATION DAY CELEBRATIONS. WE VISIT CLASSROOMS FULL OF COSTUMED, SINGING CHILDREN PREPARING THEIR OWN PERFORMANCES FOR THE EVENT. THERE IS A ROLLER-SKATING RINK, A FISHING POND THEY TELL US IS STOCKED WITH UP TO 56,000 FISH, A MEDICAL CLINIC, AND EVEN A BEAUTY PARLOR. THERE IS ALSO A 646-SEAT AUDITORIUM -- THE STAGE ADORNED WITH TWO LARGE PORTRAITS OF THE LATE FOUNDER AND HIS SON KIM JONG IL. THE "FARMERS' THEATER" IS USED FOR IDEOLOGICAL STUDIES AND PERFORMANCES. MS. KIM AS WE TOUR THE VILLAGE, A WOMAN WITH A BOOMING VOICE AND EVEN LOUDER LAUGH APPROACHES OUR CREW WITH A SMILE. HER NAME IS KIM MYONG YON AND I'M TOLD SHE'S BEEN THE MANAGER OF THIS FARM FOR 47-YEARS, AND HAS LIVED IN THE FARMING VILLAGE FOR 51 YEARS. AT 69, SHE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. WITH HER COMMANDING PRESENCE AND ALL-CONSUMING ENTHUSIASM FOR THE NORTH KOREAN LEADERS, SHE QUICKLY TAKES CONTROL OF OUR TOUR FROM THE PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER ASSIGNED TO SHOW US AROUND. I CONGRATULATE HER ON THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED VILLAGE. "IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THE LEADER!" SHE SAYS ENTHUSIASTICALLY. SHE TAKES US TO ONE OF NORTH KOREA'S VERY FIRST GREENHOUSES, FIRST VISITED BY KIM IL SUNG MORE THAN THREE DECADES AGO AND AGAIN RECENTLY BY HIS GRANDSON. THIS GREENHOUSE WAS A MODEL FOR THE INDOOR FARMING THAT ALLOWS NORTH KOREA TO GROW SOME VEGETABLES YEAR-ROUND. NORTH KOREA'S HUMID CONTINENTAL CLIMATE OF WARM SUMMERS AND COLD, DRY WINTERS AND MOSTLY MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN IS MORE SUITABLE FOR INDUSTRY THAN AGRICULTURE, SHE EXPLAINS. FOOD SHORTAGES SUPPLYING ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED THE COUNTRY'S 24 MILLION PEOPLE HAS LONG BEEN A STRUGGLE. KIM REMEMBERS WHENTHEY BARELY HAD SEEDS TO PLANT, FIRST AFTER THE KOREAN WAR AND AGAIN DURING THE GREAT FAMINE OF THE 1990S WHEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DIED OF STARVATION. THE FAMINE WAS CAUSED BY A "PERFECT STORM" OF NATURAL DISASTER, ECONOMIC CRISIS ATTRIBUTED TO A U.S.-LED ECONOMIC BLOCKADE AND NORTH KOREAN FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT, AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET BLOC, THAT DRAMATICALLY SLASHED THE AMOUNT OF AID ENTERING THE COUNTRY. "WE HAD NO FERTILIZER, NO ELECTRICITY, WE HAD TO EAT GRASS PORRIDGE," KIM SAYS. "WE REALLY STRUGGLED TO SURVIVE." KIM SAYS POVERTY WAS A WAY OF LIFE AT THE FARM VILLAGE. BUT SHE PROUDLY PROCLAIMS THE STRUGGLES ARE OVER, AND INVITES US TO RETURN NEXT FALL WHEN SHE PROMISES TO THROW US A PARTY. "OUR DREAM HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BY THE LEADER," KIM SAYS. "IN THE OLD DAYS, WE WERE SO POOR, SO BARREN. WE NEVER IMAGINED WE'D GROW THIS MANY VEGETABLES." THE CO-OP IS CONSIDERED A MODEL FOR NORTH KOREA'S 2,000 OTHER FARMS, WHOSE MANAGERS WERE BROUGHT HERE TO TOUR THE FACILITIES AND ATTEMPT TO DUPLICATE THE SYSTEM BACK IN THEIR HOME PROVINCES. JANG CHON IS LEAPS AND BOUNDS AHEAD OF THE MAJORITY OF NORTH KOREAN FARMS. THE FARM'S SENIOR MANAGERS SAY THE NEW VILLAGE WILL BE USED A PROTOTYPE FOR OTHER FARMING COMMUNITIES. DESPITE RECENT GAINS, THE U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME SAYS NORTH KOREA STILL STRUGGLES TO PRODUCE ENOUGH FOOD FOR ITS 24-MILLION PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO AN APRIL 2015, U.N. HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND PRIORITIES REPORT, 70% OF THE POPULATION IS "FOOD INSECURE AND HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO SHORTAGES IN FOOD PRODUCTION." NEW 'FREE MARKETS' IN AN APPARENT EFFORT TO BOOST PRODUCTIVITY, NORTH KOREAN FARMERS ARE NOW ALLOWED TO KEEP ANY SURPLUS FOOD TO SELL OR TRADE ON THE GROWING NETWORK OF FREE MARKETS, WHICH ALLOW EXPATS LIVING IN COUNTRY AND NORTH KOREA'S SMALL BUT GROWING MIDDLE CLASS TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL FOOD BEYOND GOVERNMENT-PROVIDED RATIONS. PREVIOUSLY, ANY SURPLUS WAS TURNED OVER TO THE STATE. THE CHANGES GIVE FARMERS AN INCENTIVE TO GROW MORE FOOD THAN THE STATE QUOTA, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO CHINA'S MARKET-BASED AGRICULTURAL REFORMS THAT BEGAN IN THE LATE 1970S AND EARLY 8

879	NINETEEN COMMONWEALTH BANK CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCEPTED COMPENSATION FROM A BANK SCHEME FOR VICTIMS OF BAD FINANCIAL ADVICE SINCE ITS LAUNCH LAST YEAR, NEW FIGURES SHOW. AN UPDATE ON THURSDAY SAID CBA'S OPEN ADVICE REVIEW, WHICH WAS CLOSED TO NEW APPLICANTS IN JULY, HAD PROMPTED 8835 CUSTOMERS TO REGISTER FOR A FREE FILE REVIEW INTO WHETHER THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION. HOWEVER, IN A SIGN OF THE PAINSTAKING REVIEW PROCESS, A MINORITY OF FILES HAVE BEEN ASSESSED SO FAR, AND THE NUMBER OF SETTLED CASES IS EVEN LOWER. THE REPORT, BY EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS PROMONTORY FINANCIAL GROUP, SAID THAT AT THE END OF AUGUST, 686 CASES HAD BEEN ASSESSED BY THE BANK. OF THIS GROUP, THE BANK HAD OFFERED COMPENSATION IN 53 CASES, OR 8 PER CENT OF ALL CASES ASSESSED. THE COMPENSATION SO FAR OFFERED BY THE BANK IS WORTH $950,252 IN TOTAL. AMONG THE 53 CUSTOMERS OFFERED A PAYOUT, 19 PEOPLE HAD ACCEPTED THE COMPENSATION, 11 HAD REJECTED THE OFFER AND 23 WERE STILL REVIEWING THE BANK'S PROPOSAL. THE BANK HAS PAID OUT $488,815 IN COMPENSATION UNDER THE SCHEME, UP FROM $79,702 AT THE END OF APRIL. CBA LAST YEAR OPENED UP THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM. IT ALLOWS ANY CUSTOMER OF COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL PLANNING AND FINANCIAL WISDOM BETWEEN 2003 AND 2012 TO HAVE THEIR FILES REVIEWED. IT FOLLOWED A DAMNING SENATE INQUIRY THAT FOUND THE BANK HAD UNDERPAID VICTIMS OF A SCANDAL, SOUGHT TO AVOID SCRUTINY, AND COVERED UP THE MISCONDUCT. "THE PROGRAM'S PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE CUSTOMERS WHO RECEIVED POOR ADVICE ARE PUT BACK IN THE POSITION THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY RECEIVED APPROPRIATE ADVICE, AND TO GIVE REASSURANCE TO OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT THE ADVICE THEY RECEIVED WAS APPROPRIATE," CBA SAID. IN APRIL, CBA CHIEF EXECUTIVE IAN NAREV SAID THE "PAINSTAKING" INVESTIGATION INTO PAST FILES WOULD TAKE UP TO MOST OF 2016. CBA SAID IT HAD INCREASED THE NUMBER OF STAFF WORKING ON THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM BY 100 SINCE MAY TO 613, ALLOWING IT TO SORT THROUGH MORE CUSTOMER FILES. WHILE IT CATALOGUED MORE THAN 900,000 CUSTOMER FILES IN THE FOUR MONTHS TO AUGUST, IT SAID THAT RETRIEVING FILES FOR FINANCIAL WISDOM CUSTOMERS WAS A "CHALLENGE" AND IT WAS STILL RELYING ON HARD COPY FILES IN SOME CASES. SEPARATELY FROM THIS COMPENSATION SCHEME, CBA HAD PAID OUT ABOUT $52 MILLION TO 1100 CUSTOMERS OF SPECIFIC ADVISERS WHO WERE IDENTIFIED FOR HAVING PROVIDED SHODDY ADVICE, MAINLY BETWEEN 2008 AND 2
880	RESEARCH METHODS THE STATEMENT BASED QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY AS A TECHNIQUE MUST BE UTILIZED PROPERLY TO SOLICIT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF DATA AND INFORMATION. NOW, FOR THE TARGET PARTICIPANTS OF THIS STUDY WILL COMPRISE OF FLIGHT ATTENDANT EMPLOYEES WITHIN CATHAY PACIFIC. THE STATEMENT BASED QUESTIONNAIRE WILL COMPRISE OF AROUND THREE TO FIVE VITAL SECTIONS. THE FIRST SECTION CONTAINS 34 STATEMENTS MEASURING POSITION, PERSONNEL POWER AND JOB PERFORMANCE IN: HR KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION PERFORMANCE DOCUMENTATION POSITION AND POWER TRANSFER JOB LABELLING AND CREATION AS WELL AS APPLICATION THE STATEMENT BASED QUESTIONS ARE BEING PROPOSED AND CREATED BY FILIUS ET AL., (2000) OF WHICH THE PARTICIPANTS ARE GOING TO BE ASKED TO COMPLETELY INDICATE EXTENTS OF AGREEMENT TO THESE STATEMENT. THIS STUDY WILL MAKE USE OF THE 5 POINT LIKERT SCALING (5 DENOTING TO COMPLETELY AGREE OF THE STATEMENT AND SO ON UP TO 1 - DENOTING TO COMPLETELY DISAGREE OF THE STATEMENT). THE SUBSEQUENT SECTION WILL GRADUALLY LIST THE TYPES OF EMPLOYEE POSITIONING AS WELL AS EMPLOYEE POWER. THE STUDY WILL ASK THE PARTICIPANTS TO ELABORATE EXTENTS OF EMPLOYEE POSITIONING AS WELL AS POWER FROM WITHIN THE WORKPLACE THROUGH LIKERT SCALING (5 WILL DENOTE TO EXTENSIVELY COVERED AND SO ON UP TO 1 AS DENOTE TO WEAKLY PUT IN COVERAGE). THE NEXT PART WILL BE EXAMINING THE EXTENTS OF AIRLINE EMPLOYEES THROUGH THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE MANAGEMENT'S DECISION-MAKING FROM WITHIN RELEVANCE TO SEVERAL ISSUES CONCERNING JOB SATISFACTION AND PERFORMANCE (5 DENOTE TO EXTENSIVELY INVOLVED AND UP TO 1 WHICH DENOTE VERY SELDOM PARTICIPATED). ANOTHER SECTION WILL IDEALLY INVESTIGATE DEGREES OF MATCH-UPS AMONG SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF JOB SATISFACTION BASE AND ITS PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SYSTEMS AND THIS GO ALONG WITH SOME REPORTS ON THE CATHAY MANAGEMENT AS A WHOLE (5 DENOTED TO FULLY MATCHED UP AND SO ON UP TO 1 DENOTES TO NOT MATCHING AT ALL). NOW, FOR THE FIFTH PART, THE PARTICIPANTS ARE TO BE ASKED TO MARK ON DEGREES OF CERTAIN MATCHES AMONG SATISFACTION THROUGH COMPENSATION SYSTEM AND THE JOB PERFORMANCE DIMENSION CONNECTING TO INFLUENCE AS WELL AS ATTITUDE BASE BY MEANS OF DOMINANCE. THERE WILL BE TOTAL OF FIVE SETS OF QUESTIONNAIRE STATEMENTS THAT MUST BE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED. THE RESPONDENTS NUMBER WILL BASED ON HOW MANY FLIGHT ATTENDANTS THAT CATHAY PACIFIC HAS, I THINK 20-30 PARTICIPANTS IS FINE. RESEARCH METHODS CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER QUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE. THE MOTIVATION FOR QUALITATIVE METHOD IS OPPOSED TO THAT OF QUANTITATIVE METHOD. QUALITATIVE METHOD IS DESIGNED TO HELP RESEARCHERS UNDERSTAND PEOPLE AND THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXTS WHICH THEY LIVE, AS THE UNDERSTANDING OF PHENOMENON FROM VIEWPOINTS OF PARTICIPANTS AND ITS PARTICULAR SOCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT IS LARGELY LOST WHEN TEXTUAL DATE IS QUANTIFIED. THE STATEMENT BASED QUESTIONS WILL BE OPEN-ENDED BASED AND GIVING OF INTENT AND ALLOWING RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS OF WHICH OBJECTIVELY CONSIDERED, ALLOWING SATISFACTION ON PERFORMANCE FOLLOW-UP STUDIES AND THE CLARIFICATION OF RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (MCMILLAN 2000), THE NEED TO PRACTICALLY ASSUME EFFECTIVE CONVERSATIONS WHEREIN QUESTIONNAIRE CONTEXTS AS WELL AS STRUCTURES WILL PUT PRIORITY ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTS OF JOB SATISFACTION ON PERFORMANCE OF EMPLOYEES AS FOUND INTO STATEMENTS RESPONSES AND VARIATIONS (PATON, 2002). THIS RESEARCH WILL IMPLY TO QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGY AS WELL AS QUANTITATIVE TECHNIQUE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, REQUESTING THE PARTICIPANTS TO RANK IN THE VIEWS THAT THEY WILL BE GIVING REGARDING TO SPECIFIC STATEMENTS LINKED TO THE STUDY BASE THROUGH EXTENSIVE LITERATURE STUDIES AND RESEARCH PATHWAYS. THE ABOVE METHOD CAN BE OF USE TO DETERMINE RESEARCH RELIABILITY AS WELL AS ITS VALIDITY. THUS, THE INFORMATION WILL BE COLLECTED AS WELL AS ANALYZED BY MEANS OF MAKING USE OF QUALITATIVE APPROACHES SUCH AS POINTING TOWARDS JOB SATISFACTION AND PERFORMANCE DOCUMENTS COMING FROM THE AIRLINE COMPANY AND THE LITERATURE INVESTIGATIONS IN GENERAL. THE PRIMARY DATA IS TO BE COLLECTED FROM THE RESPONDENTS ON CATHAYS HR BASE, SECONDARY DATA IS TO COMPRISE OF JOURNAL ASSESSMENTS CONCERNING THE RESEARCH FOCUS AND SOME RELEVANT INFORMATION ARE TO ASSOCIATE WITHIN OVERALL RESEARCH PRESENTATION.

FOR EXAMPLE, BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS. DATE: SEPTEMBER 22, 2015 SOURCE: ELIFE SUMMARY: NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE PLAYS A HUGE ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OFFSPRING. FOR EXAMPLE, BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS. SHARE: A NEW STUDY CARRIED OUT WITH BURYING BEETLES ALSO SHOWS THAT BAD PARENTING CREATES BAD PARENTS-TO-BE, WHILE WELL-CARED FOR LARVAE MATURE INTO HIGH QUALITY PARENTS. THE RESEARCH WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL ELIFE. "PARENTS OBVIOUSLY PLAY A HUGE ROLE IN DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR OFFSPRING," SAYS LEAD RESEARCHER PROFESSOR REBECCA KILNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. "THE AIM OF OUR STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE NON-GENETIC WAYS THAT PARENTS ACHIEVE THIS." THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE COULD SPEED UP THE RATE AT WHICH ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR EVOLVES AND ADAPTS IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD. WHETHER EXAMINING MOTHERS OR FATHERS, THE RESEARCH TEAM FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT RECEIVED NO CARE AS LARVAE WERE LESS EFFECTIVE AT RAISING A LARGE BROOD AS PARENTS, AND DIED YOUNGER. IN CONTRAST, HIGH QUALITY CARE NOT ONLY PRODUCES A LARGER BROOD, BUT INDIVIDUAL OFFSPRING WITH A HIGHER MASS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES. "WE FOUND THAT PARENTAL CARE PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE. GOOD QUALITY PARENTS PRODUCE OFFSPRING THAT BECOME GOOD PARENTS THEMSELVES, WHILE OFFSPRING THAT RECEIVE POOR PARENTING THEN BECOME LOW QUALITY PARENTS. OUR EXPERIMENTS SHOW HOW PARENTAL CARE ALLOWS OFFSPRING TO INHERIT CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR PARENTS, BUT NON-GENETICALLY," SHE SAYS. HOWEVER, THE TEAM ALSO FOUND THAT OFFSPRING PAY A COST FOR RECEIVING HIGH QUALITY CARE, BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION IF THEY PAIR UP WITH A LOWER QUALITY PARTNER. THIS MAY EXPLAIN WHY ANIMALS OFTEN CHOOSE A MATE THAT IS WILLING TO PUT IN A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF EFFORT AS THEM AS A PARENT. IN THIS WAY, THEY ARE LESS VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION. THE BURYING BEETLE, NICROPHORUS VESPILLOIDES, USES THE CARCASS OF A SMALL VERTEBRATE SUCH AS A MOUSE AS AN EDIBLE NEST FOR ITS YOUNG. AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS, A BREEDING PAIR BURIES THE CARCASS AND PRESERVES IT WITH AN ANTIBACTERIAL SECRETION. THE MOTHER LAYS EGGS NEARBY IN THE SOIL, AND THE LARVAE CRAWL TO THE CARCASS WHEN THEY HATCH. ALTHOUGH THE LARVAE CAN FEED THEMSELVES, THEY ALSO BEG BOTH PARENTS FOR PARTLY-DIGESTED FOOD FROM THE CARCASS. IN THE CURRENT STUDY, WHEN MALES WERE PAIRED WITH FEMALES THAT HAD RECEIVED NO POST-HATCHING CARE AS LARVAE, THEY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER LIVES THAN THOSE WHOSE PARTNERS HAD RECEIVED MORE CARE. THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT MALES WITH LOW QUALITY PARTNERS PUT MORE EFFORT INTO PARENTAL DUTIES TO COMPENSATE FOR THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THEIR MATE, AND PAID THE PRICE BY DYING YOUNGER.

884	A $61 MILLION PROPOSAL FOR WEATHERPROOFING THE POWER GRID IN THE NORTHERNMOST REACHES OF BERGEN AND PASSAIC COUNTIES, WITH FUNDING TO COME FROM A SECOND RATE HIKE IN TWO YEARS, IS SCHEDULED FOR REVIEW AT PUBLIC HEARINGS ON WEDNESDAY IN MAHWAH. ROCKLAND ELECTRIC CO. IS SEEKING APPROVAL FROM STATE UTILITY REGULATORS TO RAISE ELECTRICITY RATES 2.7 PERCENT OVER FIVE YEARS IN 22 MUNICIPALITIES TO PAY FOR IMPROVING CIRCUITS, INSTALLING HIGHER-TECH ELECTRIC METERS, BURYING SOME POWER LINES AND DOING MORE TREE-TRIMMING AROUND WIRES THAT REMAIN ABOVE GROUND. THE PUBLIC HEARINGS, BEFORE STATE BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONER MARY-ANNA HOLDEN, ARE SCHEDULED ON WEDNESDAY AT 3:30 P.M. AND 6 P.M. IN THE MAHWAH TOWNSHIP MUNICIPAL BUILDING. ROCKLAND ELECTRIC'S PROPOSAL WOULD IMPOSE ANNUAL RATE INCREASES THAT WOULD RAISE THE AVERAGE MONTHLY BILL BY ABOUT $4.84 PER MONTH AFTER FIVE YEARS. THOSE INCREASES WOULD ADD TO A $10.91 MONTHLY RATE HIKE THE BPU APPROVED LAST YEAR, MAINLY TO COVER RISING OPERATING COSTS. THE PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT BOLSTERING THE ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AGAINST SEVERE STORMS FOR THE 72,000 CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY SERVES IN COMMUNITIES RUNNING FROM ALPINE TO WEST MILFORD. IT COMES IN RESPONSE TO DEMANDS BY STATE REGULATORS FOR SO-CALLED "STORM-HARDENING" PLANS AFTER WIDESPREAD DAMAGE CAUSED BY SUPERSTORM SANDY AND OTHER BOUTS OF SEVERE WEATHER FROM 2010 TO 2012 THAT KNOCKED OUT POWER FOR UP TO TWO WEEKS. SIMILAR EFFORTS ARE PLANNED OR UNDER WAY IN OTHER AREAS OF NORTH JERSEY SERVED BY PUBLIC SERVICE ELECTRIC AND GAS. "WE RECOGNIZE CUSTOMERS' CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR BILLS. THAT'S WHY WE TOOK THIS PHASED-IN APPROACH THAT MINIMIZES THE BILL IMPACT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHILE MAXIMIZING THE CUSTOMER BENEFIT," SAID ROCKLAND ELECTRIC SPOKESMAN MIKE DONOVAN. "WE HAVE TAKEN THE LESSONS FROM SUPERSTORM SANDY AND CRAFTED THEM INTO NEW PLANS DESIGNED TO MAKE THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM MORE ROBUST, MORE RESILIENT AND MORE RESPONSIVE." THE DIVISION OF RATE COUNSEL, A STATE AGENCY THAT ADVOCATES FOR CONSUMERS IN UTILITY MATTERS, FILED COMMENTS FRIDAY OPPOSING MOST OF THE PLAN, CONTENDING THAT METER AND CIRCUIT WORK, AS WELL AS BURYING POWER LINES AND TRIMMING TREES, ARE PART OF REGULAR OPERATIONS AND NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO WEATHER ISSUES. THE COST OF THAT KIND OF WORK, THE DIVISION SAID, SHOULD BE RECOUPED THROUGH RATE HIKES UTILITIES ROUTINELY SEEK ONLY AFTER WORK IS COMPLETED. "WE THINK, FOR THE MOST PART, THAT THE [PROPOSAL] IS NOT REALLY RELATED TO STORM-HARDENING," SAID STEFANIE BRAND, DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION. "IT'S WORK THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE TO DO, BUT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE PAID FOR THROUGH A SPECIAL SURCHARGE ON RATEPAYERS." AMONG THE POTENTIALLY CONTROVERSIAL PIECES OF THE PROPOSAL IS A PLAN FOR CUTTING BACK OR CUTTING DOWN OVERGROWN OR DAMAGED TREES THAT HANG OVER ELECTRIC WIRES BUT ARE OUTSIDE THE AREA WHERE THE COMPANY HAS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO TRIM USUALLY 50 FEET AROUND POWER LINES. DONOVAN SAID THE COMPANY, WHICH OPERATES IN SOME OF THE MOST HEAVILY WOODED PARTS OF THE REGION, WOULD HIRE TREE-MAINTENANCE COMPANIES TO TRY TO WORK OUT A TRIMMING PLAN WITH PROPERTY OWNERS, BUT WOULD NOT CUT WHERE OWNERS REFUSED PERMISSION. THOSE CASES WOULD BE REFERRED TO THE BPU FOR FURTHER REVIEW, UNDER NEW REGULATIONS REQUIRING ELECTRIC COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN LISTS OF POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TREES, HE SAID. ALONG WITH INCREASED TREE MAINTENANCE, THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES REPLACING 58,000 ELECTRIC METERS WITH "SMART METERS" THAT REPORT POWER OUTAGES AT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS, THEREBY ALLOWING BETTER MONITORING OF RESTORATION EFFORTS, AND BURYING ABOUT FIVE MILES OF NEW AND EXISTING POWER LINES IN ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE AREAS. THE UNDERGROUND WORK WOULD BE DONE ALONG PETERS MINE ROAD AND AN ABANDONED RAILROAD BED IN RINGWOOD, AND MACOPIN ROAD IN WEST MILFORD, SOUTH OF UNION VALLEY ROAD. IN ADDITION, THE PLAN WOULD ADD MORE SUPPORTS TO REMAINING OVERHEAD WIRES, INSTALL STRONGER UTILITY POLES AND BUILD FLOODPROOF WALLS AROUND POWER TRANSFER STATIONS IN CRESSKILL AND UPPER SADDLE RIVER.

885	WHY ARE SOME ACTORSNOT ABLE TO CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE HOLLYWOOD LADDER?IS IT A LACK OF DROP-DEAD LOOKS? A LACK OF ACTING TALENT? WERE THEY NOT INTO PLAYING THE GAME, WHATEVER THAT MIGHT ENTAIL? MAYBE IT'S JUST A SIMPLE OL' THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T. WHO KNOWS WHY AND SURELY IT'S DIFFERENT IN EVERY CASE ANYWAY. I SUSPECT TO MAKE IT TO THE TOP, WHICH, LIKE IT OR NOT, MEANS FIT TO PLAY A ROMANTIC LEAD, ONE'S JUST GOT TO HAVE THAT CERTAIN SOMETHING. UNDEFINABLE. ELUSIVE. SOMETIMES FLEETING. MAYBE THESE GUYS DIDN'T HAVE THAT. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY HAD LONG CAREERS. SOMETHING MUST HAVE WORKED. RICHARD CONTE HAD THE BEST CAREER OF THE THREE MEN LISTED HERE. HE HAD LEADING MAN STATUS IN SOME NOTEWORTHY FILMS, ALTHOUGH HIS CAREER PROBABLY FADED QUICKER THAN HE WOULD HAVE CARED FOR. FOR MY TASTES, HE WAS A WONDERFUL NOIR ACTOR, STARRING IN A NUMBER OF B NOIRS AND DOING A DAMNED GOOD JOB. HE COULD EASILY GOFROM A DECENT GOOD GUY ROLE TO PLAYING A VICIOUS KILLER. WHAT HE SOLD BEST WAS HIS ITALIAN HERITAGE. BORN TO A BARBER AND A SEAMSTRESS IN 1910 NEW JERSEY, FROM ACHILDHOOD SPENT OFTEN IN MOVIE THEATERS, HE WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR. HE KNEW ABOUT TOUGH FROM THE STREETS HE ROAMED AND WHEN HE SAW CAGNEY, RAFT, ROBINSON AND OTHERS LOOKING LARGER THAN LIFE UP THERE ON THAT SCREEN, HE FELT HE COULD DO IT TOO. HE HAD A VARIETY OF JOBS, JUST KNOCKING AROUND NOT DOING MUCH OF ANYTHING, WHEN HE WAS DISCOVERED BY DIRECTOR ELIA KAZAN AND ACTOR JOHN GARFIELD AT A CONNECTICUT RESORT WHERE CONTE WAS WOWING 'EM AS A SINGING WAITER. THROUGH HIS CONNECTIONS KAZAN GOT CONTE ON AT THE PRESTIGIOUS NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYHOUSE WHERE HE LEARNED HIS CRAFT AND BEGAN APPEARING IN PLAYS. AS IS OFTEN THE CASE, SOME HOLLYWOOD TYPE SAW HIM AND CONTE WAS HOLLYWOOD-BOUND. THE WAR BRIEFLY INTERRUPTED THESPIAN CHORES BUT ONLY BRIEFLY. HE HAD VISION PROBLEMS THAT NIXED HIS MILITARY SERVICE BUT IT PAID OFF WELL BACK IN TINSELTOWN BECAUSE INHERITED SOME ROLES THAT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN PLAYED BY MORE ESTABLISHED ACTORS EXCEPT THEY WERE OFF TO WAR. IF HE COULDN'T BE A REAL SOLDIER, HE CERTAINLY WAS A CELLULOID ONE IN SUCH FILMS AS GUADALCANAL DIARY, THE PURPLE HEART, CAPTAIN EDDIE, A BELL FOR ADANO AND A WALK IN THE SUN. HE BECAME A NOIR FIXTURE WITH JOSEPH MANKIEWICZ'S 1946 PRODUCTION OF SOMEWHERE IN THE NIGHT, FOURTH BILLED, BUT RAISED TO SECOND IN CALL NORTHSIDE 777 WHERE JAMES STEWART IS TRYING TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE. HE WAS A COP KILLER IN CRY OF THE CITY (1948) AND ONE OF EDWARD G. ROBINSON'S FOUR SONS IN THE EXCELLENT HOUSE OF STRANGERS (1949) FOR MANKIEWICZ AGAIN. THE SAME YEAR HE WAS TOP-BILLED FOR A CHANGE IN A DARK LITTLE NOIR, THIEVES' HIGHWAY, AS A TRUCK DRIVER ROBBED OF HIS PRODUCE. HE PLAYED KLEPTOMANIAC GENE TIERNEY'S PSYCHOANALYST-HUSBAND IN THE NOIR, WHIRLPOOL, ALSO 1949. HE STARTED THE 50S WITH THE RAGING TIDE AS A SAN FRANCISCO HOOD. THREE MORE NOIRS FOLLOWED IN THE 50S... BLUE GARDENIA (1953), I BELIEVE THE FIRST FILM I SAW HIM IN, FEATURED ANNE BAXTER AS A POSSIBLE MURDER SUSPECT AND CONTE AS A REPORTER WHO INVESTIGATES. HIGHWAY DRAGNET (1954) HAD CONTE ON THE LAMB, FALSELY ACCUSED OF MURDER, WITH JOAN BENNETT AND WANDA HENDRIX IN TOW. AND BEST OF ALL HEIS A MEAN-ASS CRIME BOSS INTHE BIG COMBO (1955). FOR GOOD MEASURE, IN 1955 HE SLAPPED AROUND SUSAN HAYWARD IN THE LILLIAN ROTH BIOPIC, I'LL CRY TOMORROW. BY THE 1960S HIS CAREER WAS IN A BIT OF FREE-FALL. TELEVISION CONSUMED MORE OF HIS TIME AND HE WAS OFF TO ITALY FOR SOME WORK. HE CAME BACK TO FALL IN WITH SINATRA FOR A COUPLE OF FLICKS BUT WHATEVER STAR STATUS HE HAD HAD SOMEHOW VANISHED. RUMOR WAS HE WAS CONSIDERED FOR THE TITLE ROLE IN THE GODFATHER (1972) BUT ENDED UP ACCEPTING A LESSER ROLE. RICHARD CONTE, RELIABLE B LEADING MAN, FILM NOIR RESIDENT, DIED AT AGE 65 OF A HEART ATTACK IN LOS ANGELES IN 1975. JOHN LUND WAS HANDSOME AND BLOND AND WAS THE AFFABLE LEADING MAN TO A SELECT FEW OF THE GREAT 1940SACTRESSES, MOST OF WHOM WERE EMPLOYED AT HIS HOME STUDIO OF PARAMOUNT. HE REMAINS FAIRLY WELL-KNOWN FOR THREE OR SO FILMS, OTHERWISE, MOST FOLKS WOULD PROBABLY BE HARD-PRESSED TO NAME HIS WORK. HE SEEMED A LITTLE BORING TO ME AS AN ACTOR OR MAYBE I COULD DRESS IT UP AND SAY HIS CHARACTERS USUALLY SEEMED A TAD GLOOMY. AS ONE OF SIX CHILDREN BORN TO A NORWEGIAN GLASSBLOWER IN 1911 ROCHESTER, NEW YORK, LUND REMEMBERED HIS CHILDHOOD AS DIFFICULT AND WITH LITTLE HUMOR AND HE WAS REBELLIOUS. HE QUIT SCHOOL AT 14 AND WORKED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF JOBS BUT NEVER STAYED LONG. THE STRICTNESS OF HIS UPBRINGING WOULD INTERRUPT THE JOB SCENE AND WHEN HE SENSED BOSSES WERE TREATING HIM AS HIS FATHER DID, HE WAS GONE. HIS ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT LED HIM TO INTRODUCING A NO-SMOKING PROGRAM AND WRITING A MAIL-ORDER MANUAL ON MIND-READING. HE GOT HOOKED ON PERFORMING WHEN HE APPEARED IN AN INDUSTRIAL SHOW AT THE 1939 WORLD'S FAIR. ON A WHIM HE AUDITIONED FOR A LOCAL PLAY AND WAS HIRED. THAT, IN TURN, LED TO MORE WORK IN SUMMER STOCK, OFF-BROADWAY AND THEN ON BROADWAY IN AS YOU LIKE IT AND HE ALSO WROTE THE BOOK AND LYRICS FOR THE REVUE, NEW FACES OF 1943. PARAMOUNT CAME-A-HUNTING, TOOK A LONG LOOK AT THOSE NORDIC GOOD LOOKS AND HIRED HIM ON THE SPOT. LUND'S AUSPICIOUS DEBUT WAS IN 1946S TO EACH HIS HOME, A ROMANCE-DRAMA THAT CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF AN ADORING AUDIENCE. LUND PLAYED DUAL ROLES AS OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND'S ILLEGITIMATE SON WHOM SHE GIVES UP AND THE PILOT WHO FATHERED THE CHILD. THE FILM'S SUBJECT MATTER WAS VERY BRAVE FOR 1946 AND AS A RESULT FOLKS FLOCKED TO IT AND AFTERWARDS EVERYONE WAS ASKING WHO THAT BLOND GUY WAS. DE HAVILLAND WOULD WIN HER FIRST OSCAR FOR THIS LOVELY LITTLE FILM. HE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO HOLD HIS OWN OPPOSITE BETTY HUTTON IN THE PERILS OF PAULINE (1947). PROBABLY HIS BEST AND MOST-REMEMBERED ROLE WAS IN BILLY WILDER'S MILITARY COMEDY, A FOREIGN AFFAIR. HE IS AN ARMY CAPTAIN STATIONED IN BERLIN WHO BECOMES ENAMORED OF A CAF SINGER (MARLENE DIETRICH) AND THE U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (JEAN ARTHUR) INVESTIGATING HER. I CAME TO FIND LUND UNCOMFORTABLE LOOKING IN COMEDIES BUT PERHAPS THAT WAS ALSO WHY HE COULD BE SO GOOD IN THEM. LUND WENT ON TO APPEAR OPPOSITE BARBARA STANWYCK IN A FINE NOIR, NO MAN OF HER OWN (1950), HE SWAM OPPOSITE ESTHER WILLIAMS IN THE SAME YEAR'S THE DUCHESS OF IDAHO AND LOOKED PERFECTLY FOOLISH OPPOSITE MARTIN & LEWIS IN TWO MY FRIEND IRMA FILMS (1949-50). ONE OF HIS BESTFILMS WAS THE COMEDY MISTAKEN-IDENTITY COMEDY,THE MATING SEASON (1951), WHERE GENE TIERNEY AS HIS WIFE AND THELMA RITTER AS HIS MOTHER OUTSHONE HIM. I FIRST SAW HIM OPPOSITE MY FAVORITE ACTRESS AT THE TIME, JOAN LESLIE, IN THE WESTERNWOMAN THEY ALMOST LYNCHED (1953), WHICH, OF COURSE, I LOVED. HE STAYED IN THE SADDLE FOR TWO IN 1955, CHIEF CRAZY HORSE AND WHITE FEATHER, AS A CAVALRY OFFICER. BY THE TIME HE APPEARED AS GRACE KELLY'S JILTED FIANC IN HER FINAL FILM, HIGH SOCIETY, IT WAS CLOSE TO BEING HIS FINAL FILM AS WELL.HIS CAREER FOR SOME REASON HAD PETERED OUT. HIS LAST ROLE WAS AS SANDRA DEE'S DISGRUNTLED FATHER IN 1962S IF A MAN ANSWERS. IN 1963 LUND MOVED TO SAN DIEGO TO PURSUE BUSINESS INTERESTS. I SUSPECT HE TURNED AWAY FROM HOLLYWOOD AND NEVER LOOKED BACK. HIS ONLY WIFEDIED IN 1982 AFTER 40 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE I READ THEY'D BEEN SEPARATED FOR YEARS. LUND DIED10 YEARS LATER. WHAT I READ NOW SAYS DEATH WAS FROM HEART PROBLEMS BUT I DISTINCTLY RECALL MY SURPRISE AT HEARING A NEWSCAST AT THE TIME SAYING HE DIED FROM AN AIDS-RELATED ILLNESS AND HAD A LONGTIME PARTNER. BARRY SULLIVAN IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE ACTORS WHO HAD THESTATE OF INERTIA ABOUT HIM. I ALWAYS WANTED TO RUN UP TO MY MOVIE SCREEN, SOMEHOW REACH IN AND SHAKE HIM. GET MAD, BARRY, YELL, BREAK SOMETHING. HE SETTLED EARLY ON INTO PARTS THAT JUST DIDN'T REQUIRE MUCH OF HIM AS AN ACTOR. THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER HE SEEMED TO PLAY THE SAME DOUR-FACED ROLES OVER AND OVER AGAIN... DIPLOMATS, POLITICIANS, SHERIFFS, SENIOR OFFICERS, HUSBANDS WHOSE ACTION WAS SECONDARY TO THE MAIN PLOT. HE WAS ONE OF THOSE UNOBTRUSIVE B ACTORS WHO OVER-POPULATED THE FILMS OF THE BIG FEMALE STARS. BECAUSE HE NEVERATTEMPTED TO STEAL THE LIMELIGHT FROM STANWYCK, CRAWFORD, DAVIS, YOUNG, GARSON, COLBERT, WYMAN OR TURNER, MOST OF WHOM WOULD HAVE CASTRATED HIM HAD HE TRIED, HE WAS CHOSEN AS THEIR LEADING MAN, IN SOME CASES MULTIPLE TIMES. BORN IN 1912 NEW YORK CITY, HE WAS THE SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON, A FACT THAT HAD CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE IN CELTIC FAMILIES. THROUGHOUT HIS TEENAGE YEARS HE HAD HIS MIND SET ON BEING A LAWYER AND HE WOULD GO ON TO STUDY AT NEW YORK AND TEMPLE UNIVERSITIES. BUT THE ACTING BUG BIT HIM AND HE WOULD GO ON TO APPEAR ON BROADWAY MANY TIMES, BEGINNING IN 1936. IN NEW YORK HEMADE A NUMBER OF TWO-REEL COMEDIES WHICH INCREASED HIS APPETITE TO MAKE HOLLYWOOD MOVIES. BY 1940 HE WAS OUT WEST BOUNCING AROUND FROM STUDIO TO STUDIO. HE WAS PROBABLY FIRST NOTICED AS GINGER ROGERS SHRINK IN 1944'S LADY IN THE DARK AND THE SAME YEAR AS LORETTA YOUNG'S FIANC IN AND NOW TOMORROW. IN THE MID-TO-LATE 40S HETOOK THE FILM NOIR ROUTE WITH TITLES SUCH AS THE GANGSTER, SUSPENSE, FRAMED AND TENSION. HE PLAYED THE BOORISH TOM BUCHANAN IN THE 1949 ALAN LADD VERSION OF THE GREAT GATSBY. ONE OF HIS BEST VILLAINOUS ROLES WAS AS YOUNG'S INSANELY JEALOUS HUSBAND IN CAUSE FOR ALARM (1950). IN 1951 HE HAD THE LEADING MALE ROLE AS BETTE DAVIS' ATTORNEY HUSBAND (WHO'S TRYING TO DUMP HER) IN PAYMENT ON DEMAND. ONE OF HISMOST WIDELY-SEENROLES WAS AS THEMOVIE DIRECTOR WHOSE REPUTATION IS TARNISHED BY PRODUCER KIRK DOUGLASIN THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL (1952). HE WAS BARBARA STANWYCK'S LEADING MAN IN THE 1953 NOIR, JEOPARDY, AND IN THE WESTERNS THE MAVERICK QUEEN (1956)AND FORTY GUNS (1957). IN 1955 HE WAS JAMES STEWART'S COMMANDING OFFICER IN STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND AND JOAN CRAWFORD'SCUCKOLDED HUSBAND IN QUEEN BEE (A REAL HOOT IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT). HE COMFORTED AN HYSTERICAL DORIS DAY IN JULIE (1956) AND WAS BRIEFLY SEEN AS OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND'S HUSBANDIN THE VERY GOOD LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA(1962). WHILE HE CONTINUED TO WORK INTO THE LATE 80S, HIS FILMSBECAMELESS SIGNIFICANT. HE HAD LONG INTERMINGLED MOVIES WITH TELEVISION BUT THE LATTER BECAME MORE OF A MAINSTAY IN HIS LATER YEARS. SULLIVAN WAS MARRIED THREE TIMES AND HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND A SON. HIS SON WAS MENTALLY DISABLED AND SULLIVAN BECAME A CRUSADER FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. HE DIED OF RESPIRATORY CAUSES IN SHERMAN OAKS, CALIFORNIA, IN 1994 AT AGE 81. NEXT POSTING: JOAN & BETTE

887	GOLD IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED WITH THE US DOLLAR TRADING UP. I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT GOLD HAS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US DOLLAR AS WHEN THE US DOLLAR IS DOWN, GOLD TENDS TO RISE IN VALUE AND VICE-VERSA. THINK OF IT AS A SEESAW, WHEN ONE IS UP THE OTHER SHOULD BE DOWN. I POINT THIS OUT TO YOU TO MAKE YOU AWARE THAT WHEN WE DONT HAVE A CORRELATED MARKET, IT MEANS SOMETHING IS WRONG. AS TRADERS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS AND PROCEED WITH YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN. ALL OF ASIA TRADED LOWER. PLEASE NOTE THE CHINA EXCHANGES ARE CLOSED FOR A BANK HOLIDAY. AS OF THIS WRITING ALL OF EUROPE IS TRADING LOWER. POSSIBLE CHALLENGES TO TRADERS TODAY - FOMC MEMBER LACKER SPEAKS AT 8:15 AM EST.  THE QUESTIONS, WHO OR WHAT DO I USE A MICROCHIP THAT DATES BACK TO 250 MILLION YEARS AGO? THIS IS MAJOR. - AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS M/M IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - NON-FARM EMPLOYMENT CHANGE IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. CURRENCIES YESTERDAY THE SWISS FRANC MADE ITS MOVE AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AFTER THE UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS NUMBERS CAME OUT. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND THAT TIME AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHARTS BELOW THE USD GAVE A SIGNAL AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST, WHILE THE SWISS FRANC ALSO GAVE A SIGNAL AT JUST ABOUT THE SAME TIME. LOOK AT THE CHARTS BELOW AND YOULL SEE A PATTERN FOR BOTH ASSETS. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH. THESE CHARTS REPRESENT THE LATEST VERSION OF TREND FOLLOWING TRADES AND IVE CHANGED THE TIMEFRAME TO A RENKO CHART TO DISPLAY BETTER. THIS REPRESENTED A SHORTING OPPORTUNITY ON THE SWISS FRANC, AS A TRADER YOU COULD HAVE NETTED 20 PLUS TICKS ON THIS TRADE. WE ADDED A DONCHIAN CHANNEL TO THE CHARTS TO SHOW THE SIGNALS MORE CLEARLY.  CHARTS COURTESY OF TREND FOLLOWING TRADES BUILT ON A NINJA TRADER PLATFORM BIAS YESTERDAY WE SAID OUR BIAS WAS NEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER.  TRUMP SAW AN OPENING HERE AND BARRELLED THROUGH IT IN TYPICAL FASHION, TELLING MSNBC THE FOLLOWING MORNING HOW GLAD HE WAS CARSON HAD BACKED HIM. THE MARKETS MEANDERED INTO AND OUT OF POSITIVE TERRITORY ALL SESSION LONG BUT THE DOW CLOSED HIGHER BY 24 POINTS HOWEVER THE NASDAQ DROPPED BY 17, THE S&P CLIMBED BY 2. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS JOBS FRIDAY OUR BIAS IS NEUTRAL. COULD THIS CHANGE? OF COURSE. REMEMBER ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN A VOLATILE MARKET. COMMENTARY YESTERDAY WE SAID OUR BIAS WAS NEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS (USD AND BONDS) WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER AND USUALLY THATS NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR AN UPSIDE DAY. WHAT WE DIDNT SEE WAS FOLLOW THRU ON THE PART OF THE INDICES HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS JOBS FRIDAY WE WILL MAINTAIN A NEUTRAL BIAS AS WE ALWAYS DO FOR JOBS FRIDAY. WHY? BECAUSE THE MARKETS HAVE NEVER SHOWN ANY SENSE OF NORMALCY ON JOBS FRIDAY OR FOMC DAY HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS. YESTERDAYS UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS CAME IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED AT 282,003 VERSUS 273,000 EXPECTED. TIME WILL TELL IF THIS HAS ANY EFFECT ON NON-FARM PAYROLLS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE ITS A GIVEN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WE WORK HARD FOR WHATEVER WE HAVE; WE SHOULD TAKE TIME TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOR. !!!! GOOD MORNING TRADERS, AS OF THIS WRITING 4:10 AM EST, HERES WHAT WE SEE: US DOLLAR: DOWN AT 96.240 THE US DOLLAR IS DOWN 183 TICKS AND TRADING AT 96.240. ENERGIES: OCTOBER CRUDE IS DOWN AT 46.20. FINANCIALS: THE SEPT 30 YEAR BOND IS UP 22 TICKS AND TRADING AT 156.26. INDICES: THE SEPT S&P 500 EMINI ES CONTRACT IS DOWN 44 TICKS AND TRADING AT 1935.00. GOLD: THE OCTOBER GOLD CONTRACT IS TRADING DOWN AT 1123.80. GOLD IS 2 TICKS LOWER THAN ITS CLOSE. INITIAL CONCLUSION THIS IS NOT A CORRELATED MARKET.  THE FINANCIALS SHOULD ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH THE US DOLLAR SUCH THAT IF THE DOLLAR IS LOWER THEN BONDS SHOULD FOLLOW AND VICE-VERSA. THE INDICES ARE DOWN AND CRUDE IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED.

889	IF THERE WAS ONE THING TCU HAD WORKING IN ITS FAVOR A YEAR AGO EN ROUTE TO A 11-1 SEASON AND A TRIP TO THE PEACH BOWL, IT WAS THE UNCANNY ABILITY TO STAY HEALTHY. ONE WEEK INTO THE 2015 SEASON AND ALREADY TCU COULD BE DOWN A COUPLE OF DEFENSIVE PLAYERS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON. ON TUESDAY TCU HEAD COACH GARY PATTERSON ANNOUNCED STARTING LINEBACKER SAMMY DOUGLAS WILL MISS THE REMAINDER OF THE SEASON DUE TO AN UNDISCLOSED INJURY. PATTERSON ALSO SUGGESTED DEFENSIVE END JAMES MCFARLAND COULD ALSO BE OUT FOR SOME TIME, EVEN AS LONG AS THE REST OF THE SEASON DUE TO A FOOT INJURY. THE LOSS OF ONE OF THESE TWO PLAYERS WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT LOSS FOR A DEFENSE THAT IS ALREADY TASKED WITH FILLING KEY SPOTS ON THE DEPTH CHART THIS SEASON. LOSING BOTH WOULD BE EVEN MORE COMPLICATED. LAST SEASON SAW MCFARLAND LEAD TCUWITH SEVEN SACKS. HE ALSO RETURNED AN INTERCEPTION FOR A TOUCHDOWN WHILE ALSO RECORDING 12 TACKLES FOR A LOSS. DOUGLAS HAD JUST 17 TACKLES LAST SEASON BUT HE MADE UP FOR A LACK OF STATS IN PLAYING EXPERIENCE AS A JUNIOR. WITHOUT DOUGLAS, TCU WILL TURN TO SOME YOUTH WITH MIKE FREEZE OR TY SUMMERS CONTINUING TO FILL HIS SPOT ON THE DEPTH CHART. GIVEN PATTERSONS HISTORY, YOU WOULD THINK HE WILL FIND A WAY TO WORK THINGS OUT ON DEFENSE THIS SEASON TO HELP KEEP THE HORNED FROGS IN BIG 12 AND PLAYOFF CONTENTION. BUT THE LOSS OF TWO KEY DEFENSIVE PLAYERS LIKE THIS HURTS THOSE CHANCES A BIT. HOW MUCH IT COSTS TCU REMAINS TO BE SEEN. FOLLOW @KEVINONCFB AS YOU NO DOUBT KNOW BY NOW, THE HIGHEST-RANKED CONFERENCE CHAMPION FROM THE AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE, CONFERENCE USA, MAC, MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE OR SUN BELT CONFERENCE WILL RECEIVE AN AUTOMATIC SPOT IN THE NEW YEARS SIX BOWL LINE-UP. THE RANKING USED IS NOT THE AP OR COACHES POLLS, BUT THE RANKING COOKED UP BY THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF SELECTION COMMITTEE. LAST SEASON THE BIG BOWL SPOT WENT TO BOISE STATE. THE BRONCOS ARE ONCE AGAIN A FAVORITE TO LAND THAT BOWL INVITATION, BUT ONE SLIP ALONG THE WAY COULD OPEN A DOOR FOR OTHERS. BOISE STATE TRAVELS TO PROVO, UTAH THIS WEEK FOR A BIG MATCH-UP WITH BYU. BYU DOES NOT FIGURE INTO THE GROUP OF FIVE CONVERSATION AS A FOOTBALL INDEPENDENT, BUT THE COUGARS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE OUTLOOK ANYWAY. BYU, COMING OFF A WILD WIN AT NEBRASKA AND LOSING QUARTERBACK TAYSOM HILL , COULD BE IN POSITIONS FOR A LETDOWN GAME, BUT THE BRONCOS AND COUGARS HAVE PUT TOGETHER SOME TOUGH CONTESTS IN RECENT YEARS. THIS WEEK SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT. BOISE STATE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE THIS WEEKEND AND STILL END THE YEAR ON TOP OF THE GROUP OF FIVE IN THE EYES OF THE SELECTION COMMITTEE, BUT ONE LOSS IS A SLIM MARGIN FOR ERROR IN THIS RACE. PERHAPS BOISE STATES TOP THREAT IN THE GROUP OF FIVE RACE IS CINCINNATI, THE PRESEASON AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE FAVORITES. THE BEARCATS, WITH GUNNER KIEL , SHOULD BE A PROGRAM READY TO MAKE A RUN FOR A NEW YEARS SIX BOWL GAME ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS GIVEN THE RESOURCESAVAILABLE TO THEM AND THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF THE CONFERENCE. IF BOISE STATE SLIPS, CINCINNATI IS NEXT IN LINE. BUT WHAT IF CINCINNATI LOSES THIS WEEKEND? CINCINNATI HOSTS TEMPLE THIS WEEK, WITH THE OWLS FRESH OFF THEIR FIRST VICTORY OVER PENN STATE SINCE 1941. IF TEMPLE MANAGES TO PICK UP A WIN AT CINCINNATI SOMETHING LAST ACCOMPLISHED IN 1985 THEN THE OWLS MAY BECOME A TRENDY TEAM TO FOLLOW IN THIS SEASON-LONG DISCUSSION. THE SCHEDULE CERTAINLY WORKS IN TEMPLES FAVOR AT LEAST. IF TEMPLE ESCAPES CINCINNATI WITH A WIN, THE OWLS THEN HAVE A CHANCE TO BRING A 3-0 RECORD INTO THE BYE WEEK WITH A ROAD GAME AT UMASS. IN CONFERENCE PLAY, TEMPLE DOES NOT PLAY HOUSTON OR NAVY, TWO POTENTIAL CONTENDERS IN THE AAC WEST DIVISION. TEMPLE ALSO GETS MEMPHIS AND UCF AT HOME. IF TEMPLES DEFENSIVE PERFORMANCE AGAINST PENN STATE WAS A PREVIEW OF THINGS TO COME, EACH OF THOSE GAMES COULD BE POSSIBLE WINS. TEMPLE ALSO HOSTS NOTRE DAME ON OCTOBER 31, WHICH COULD MAKE FOR A NICE LITTLE SPOTLIGHT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SELECTION COMMITTEE. IF I HAD TO RANK THE TOP FIVE GROUP OF FIVE TEAMS AFTER ONE WEEK OF PLAY, HERE IS HOW I THINK THE SELECTION COMMITTEE MIGHT RANK THEM BASED ON PERFORMANCE TO DATE; BOISE STATE TEMPLE OWLS CINCINNATI BEARCATS NAVY LOUISIANA TECH UNLIKE THE COACHES POLL RELEASED EARLIER IN THE DAY , OHIO STATE REMAINS THE UNANIMOUS NUMBER ONE IN THE LATEST AP TOP 25 POLL. THE BUCKEYES RECEIVED ALL 61 OF THE POSSIBLE NUMBER ONE AP VOTES IN THE FIRST POLL OF THE REGULAR SEASON THE DAY AFTER TURNING ASIDE VIRGINIA TECH IN BLACKSBURG. THERE WAS SOME MOVEMENT WITHIN THE TOP 10 THOUGH, AS NO. 2 ALABAMA SWAPPED POSITIONS WITH NO. 3 TCU JUST AS THEY DID IN THE COACHES POLL. NOTRE DAME ALSO CREPT INTO THE TOP 10 AFTER MOVING UP FROM NO. 11 TO NO. 9 AFTER DEMOLISHING TEXAS IN SOUTH BEND. NO. 10 GEORGIA DROPPED DOWN ONE SPOT AS THE IRISH PASSED THEM BUT THE BULLDOGS ROUND OUT THE LATEST AP TOP 10. IN ALL, A TOTAL OF 10 TEAMS FROM THE SEC APPEAR IN THE AP TOP 25 POLL THIS WEEK. THAT IS A NEW RECORD FOR A SINGLE CONFERENCE , WHICH WILL SURELY GET SOME PLAY AS THE WEEK UNFOLDS. THE PREVIOUS RECORD OF EIGHT TEAMS WAS HEL D BY THE SEC IN THE PRESEASON RANKING. NO. 4 BAYLOR, NO. 5 MICHIGAN STATE, NO. 6 AUBURN, NO. 7 OREGON AND NO. 8 USC ALL STAYED IN THEIR PRESEASON RANK. FLORIDA STATE DROPPED OUT OF THE TOP 10, MOVING DOWN ONE SPOT TO NO. 11 IN THE AP POLL. THE SEMINOLES ARE FOLLOWED BY ACC ATLANTIC RIVAL CLEMSON, UCLA, LSU AND GEORGIA TECH. SIMILAR TO THE COACHES POLL, TEXAS A&M MAKES A SPLASH IN ITS DEBUT IN THE AP TOP 25 THIS SEASON, CRACKING THE POLL AT NO. 16 AFTER A RESOUNDING WIN AGAINST ARIZONA STATE. THE SUN DEVILS DROPPED OUT OF THE POLL AFTER BEING RANKED NO. 15 IN THE PRESEASON AP POLL. OTHER TEAMS MAKING A DEBUT IN THE AP POLL THIS WEEK ARE NO. 24 UTAH AND NO. 25 MISSISSIPPI STATE.

890	ONCE CHARLIE PARKER, DIZZY GILLESPIE, THELONIOUS MONK, BUD POWELL, CURLEY RUSSELL, MAX ROACH AND OTHER BLACK JAZZ MUSICIANS PIONEERED BEBOP AND BEGAN RECORDING THE REVOLUTIONARY STYLE IN 1945, OTHER GIFTED JAZZ ARTISTS OF THE PERIOD QUICKLY FIGURED OUT THE NEW LANGUAGE. AMONG THE MOST EXCITING AND PROFICIENT BOP GROUPS OF 1947 WAS THE SHORT-LIVED SERGE CHALOFF SEXTETTE. THE GROUP RECORDED FOUR SONGS (ENOUGH FOR TWO 78S) AND FEATURED RED RODNEY (TP), EARL SWOPE (TB), SERGE CHALOFF (BAR), GEORGE WALLINGTON (P), CURLY RUSSELL (B) AND TINY KAHN (D). FIVE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP WERE IN THE GEORGE AULD SEXTET, WHICH GIGGED IN NEW YORK BUT, SADLY, DID NOT RECORD. SWOPE WAS ADDED IN PLACE OF AULD. [PICTURED FROM LEFT, THE GEORGE CHALOFF SEXTETTE: GEORGE WALLINGTON, CURLEY RUSSELL, RED RODNEY, TINY KAHN, EARL SWOPE, TEDDY REIG (PARTIALLY HIDDEN) AND SERGE CHALOFF, COURTESY OF THE INSTITUTE OF JAZZ STUDIES] EARLIER IN '47, IN JANUARY, RODNEY HAD LED A BOP SEXTET SESSION FOR KEYNOTE, WITH CHALOFF, ALLEN EAGER (TS), AL HAIG (P), CHUBBY JACKSON (B) AND KAHN. TWO MONTHS LATER, CHALOFF PUT HIS SEXTET TOGETHER FOR SAVOY. THE RODNEY DATE IS STRONG BUT NOT NEARLY AS HAIR-RAISING, SINCE THE BAND RELIED ON AL COHN AND GERRY MULLIGAN ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH HAD A CERTAIN CIVILITY. [PHOTO OF SERGE CHALOFF ABOVE IN 1948 BY POPSIE RANDOLPH, COURTESY OF THE FRANK DRIGGS COLLECTION] ON THE SERGE CHALOFF SEXTETTE DATE, THREE OF THE FOUR SONGS RECORDED PUMPERNICKEL, SERGE'S URGE AND BAR A SECOND WERE WRITTEN AND ARRANGED BY CHALOFF WHILE THE FOURTH, GABARDINE AND SERGE, WAS BY KAHN. ALL FOUR TUNES ARE DAREDEVIL CUTE AND BLISTERINGLY FAST. THEY SHOWCASE TIGHT UNISON LINES AND STANDOUT SOLOS BY FOUR OF THE SIX MUSICIANS, WHO ARE IN SUPERB FORM. PUMPERNICKEL, FOR EXAMPLE, STARTS WITH AN IMPECCABLE PACE-SETTER BY PIANIST WALLINGTON. AFTER A BREATHLESS 16 BARS BY THE GROUP, CHALOFF SHOWS OFF HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND LEONINE APPROACH TO THE BARITONE SAX. HE'S FOLLOWING BY RODNEY ON TRUMPET, WHO IS STILL VASTLY UNDERRATED AS A SWINGING BOPPER. SWOPE'S ATTACK ON TROMBONE IS FORCEFUL AND SPIRITED, WITH A SEXY BOP SWAGGER. [PHOTO OF SERGE CHALOFF ABOVE IN 1948 BY POPSIE RANDOLPH, COURTESY OF THE FRANK DRIGGS COLLECTION] THE FOUR CHALOFF LEADERSHIP TRACKS FROM 1947 ARE TERRIFIC ENTRY POINTS FOR LISTENERS INTERESTED IN ANY OR ALL OF THE MUSICIANS INVOLVED AND BEBOP IN GENERAL. ALL I'LL SAY IS THAT THE YEARS AFTER WORLD WAR II MUST HAVE BEEN A TRIP IN NEW YORK.

892	PETER DUTTON HAS ATTACKED FAIRFAX AND ABC FOR TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SOURCE: AAP CABINET MINISTERS WHO LEAK TO THE MEDIA ARE PUTTING THEIR OWN AMBITIONS AHEAD OF THE COUNTRY, A SENIOR FRONTBENCHER SAYS. IMMIGRATION MINISTER PETER DUTTON'S WARNING CAME AS FEDERAL CABINET BEGAN TO MEET IN CANBERRA TO DISCUSS COMPETITION LAWS AND NATIONAL SECURITY. SENIOR COALITION SOURCES HAVE BEEN VENTING COMPLAINTS ABOUT COLLEAGUES TO MEDIA OUTLETS IN RECENT WEEKS, WITH THE MOST RECENT ATTACKS AIMED AT TREASURER JOE HOCKEY'S PERFORMANCE. TWO WEEKS AGO PRIME MINISTER TONY ABBOTT WARNED THE CABINET AND PARTY ROOM ABOUT THE NEED FOR UNITY AND THE POTENTIAL FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST LEAKERS - WHICH MR DUTTON REPEATED ON TUESDAY. "IF YOU CAN DISCOVER WHO THE PERSON IS, OF COURSE THEY SHOULD BE (SACKED)," MR DUTTON TOLD THE SEVEN NETWORK. "IT CAN ONLY BE FOR THEIR OWN AMBITIONS. IT CAN'T BE FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR COUNTRY." READ MORE SOCIAL SERVICES MINISTER SCOTT MORRISON LIKENED THE NEWS REPORTS ABOUT DISUNITY TO REALITY TELEVISION. "IT'S SPECULATIVE NONSENSE, I'M NOT GOING TO INDULGE THIS FANTASY," MR MORRISON TOLD ABC RADIO. MR MORRISON, WHO HAS BEEN FLAGGED AS A POTENTIAL FUTURE TREASURER OR LEADER, SAID MR HOCKEY WAS A GREAT BLOKE DOING A "TREMENDOUS JOB". MR DUTTON CLAIMED FAIRFAX MEDIA, HELPED BY THE ABC, WAS TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. "THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS A BIT OF A JIHAD BEING CONDUCTED BY FAIRFAX AT THE MOMENT," HE SAID. REPORTERS HAD "MORPHED INTO FRUSTRATED POLITICIANS", HE SAID. LABOR MINISTERS DURING THE RUDD-GILLARD ERA ACCUSED NEWS CORP AUSTRALIA OF TRYING TO OVERTURN THE GOVERNMENT. ASSISTANT TREASURER JOSH FRYDENBERG SAID HE WAS CONFIDENT THE GOVERNMENT WAS ON TRACK, DESPITE THE LEAKS. "I THINK WITH A YEAR OR MORE TO GO UNTIL THE NEXT ELECTION WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO REGROUP," HE TOLD ABC RADIO. THE GOVERNMENT FACES A BY-ELECTION TEST ON SEPTEMBER 19 WHEN VOTERS IN THE WEST AUSTRALIAN SEAT OF CANNING ELECT A REPLACEMENT FOR THE LATE LIBERAL MP DON RANDALL. MR MORRISON SAID IT WAS A TEST FOR THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT, NOT JUST ONE MINISTER. "WE'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE IT," HE SAID. OPPOSITION LEADER BILL SHORTEN SAID GOVERNMENT MINISTERS SHOULD NOT BLAME JOURNALISTS FOR THEIR MISTAKES. "MY ADVICE TO PETER DUTTON IS IF YOU WANT BETTER COVERAGE, BE A BETTER GOVERNMENT," MR SHORTEN TOLD REPORTERS IN WHITTLESEA, WHERE HE WAS VISITING A SCHOOL. "I WOULD LIKE MR ABBOTT AND HIS LIBERAL TEAM TO START STANDING UP FOR AUSTRALIAN JOBS FOR ONCE, PUT THE JOBS OF AUSSIES FIRST RATHER THAN YOUR OWN JOBS."
893	I MENTIONED IT LAST WEEK, BUT I'M OUT OF TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS IN SEATTLE AND CHICAGO (HOUSE HUNTING FOR OUR NEW PLACE AND SAYING GOODBYE TO MY CHILDHOOD HOME) AND I'VE RALLIED A FEW OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGER FRIENDS TO FILL IN FOR ME FOR THIS ENTIRE WEEK. THE FIRST GUEST BLOGGER IS LAUREN, WHOSE BLOG, POST GRAD IN PROGRESS, I FOUND THROUGH A LINK UP. SHE'S SUPER SWEET AND YOU'LL LOVE HER! HELLO, HELLO, THANKS SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME JULIE! IFEEL PRETTY HONORED, HUMBLED,ANDTHRILLEDBY JULIE'S GRACIOUS INVITATION FOR ME TO GUEST BLOG WHILE SHE'S AWAY. BUT BEFORE I GET AHEAD OF MYSELF LET'S START WITH AN INTRODUCTION. HI, I'M THE POST GRAD AND I BLOG AT POST GRAD IN PROGRESS. BUT MY NAME IS LAUREN AND I'M A NEW GRADUATE NAVIGATING THROUGH THE REAL WORLD TRYING TO DIG DEEP INTO WHAT MAKES ME TICK.THE REAL WORLD FOR ME BEING, MOVING TO A NEW CITY, STARTING A NEW JOB, AND MOLDING NEW FRIENDSHIPS ALONG THE WAY. MY BLOG IS MY HAPPY PLACE. IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO CRAFT LIKE MY FAVORITE ANTHROPOLOGIE HACK COASTERS, WRITE RECIPES LIKE MY DELICIOUS MEATLOAF, AND DETAIL MY TRAVELS: RUSSIA, SAN DIEGO (PART 1), SAN DIEGO (PART 2), AND MY NEW ADVENTURE OF EAT, PRAY, LOVING IT IN EUROPE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE BLOGGERS, ERIKA, DOES THIS SERIES OWNING IT WHERE YOU TELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR QUIRKS AND WHAT MAKES YOU, WELL, YOU. EVERY TIME I READ A NEW POST ON A NEW BLOGGER I RACK MY BRAIN OF WHAT I DO THAT IS UNIQUE TO ME. ALAS, THIS MAKES THE PERFECT GUEST POST. I BASICALLY GET ALL MY JUNK ON THE TABLE FROM THE GET-GO! THIS COULD GO ONE OF TWO WAYS...SOME PEOPLE WILL RELATE OR JUST LAUGH AT MY CRAZINESS OR SOME PEOPLE MIGHT RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BUT HEY, I'MOWNINGIT. TODAY AND EVERYDAY. HI I'M LAUREN. 22 YEARS OLD AND I STILL SLEEP WITH MY BABY "BLANKET." YES, I PUT BLANKET IN QUOTATIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY, IT ISN'T A BLANKET ANYMORE. HE IS THEREMNANTOF A FORMER BLANKET TIED TOGETHER IN A RAG. ALSO, YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT I REFER TO MY BLANKET AS "HE" BECAUSE HE JUST ALWAYS HAS BEEN. WEIRD, I KNOW. I CALL HIM "T" BECAUSE MY BABYSITTER CALLED HIM MY TRANQUILIZER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND IT STUCK. HE'S A SENSE OF COMFORT AND MAY I SAY, AWELL-TRAVELEDBLANKET. GOOD GRACIOUS, I'VE LOST HALF OF JULIE'S READERS BY THIS POINT. I'M THE CLUMSIEST PERSON YOU'LL MEET BUT I'VE NEVER BROKEN A BONE AND I'VE NEVER HAD STITCHES. PICTURE ME KNOCKING ON WOOD AT THIS MOMENT. RAW POTATOES GIVE ME THE HEEBIE JEEBIES. I LOVE THE TASTE OF POTATOES...FRENCH FRIES, BAKED POTATOES, SCALLOPED POTATOES...BUT RAW POTATOES FREAK. ME. OUT. MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY SMELL LIKE DIRT AND THEY CAN GROW ROOTS WHEN THEY SIT IN YOUR PANTRY TOO LONG. MY SKIN CRAWLS THINKING ABOUT IT. P.S. JUST POTATOES NOT SWEET POTATOES.I'M STRANGE. I CRY AT THE DROP OF THE HAT. ONEYOUTUBEVIDEO OF A SOLDIER REUNITING WITH HIS FAMILY AND I'M DUNZO. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE, I CRY LAUGHING SO EASILY. IT'S BORDERLINE EMBARRASSING BECAUSE ONCE I GET GOING I CAN'T STOP. ALSO, MY CRYING LAUGHING DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE WHERE I AM. MY COWORKERS HAVE SEEN ME CRYING LAUGHING WAY TOO MANY TIMES. WHEN I WAS IN 2ND GRADE AND MY FAMILY WENT TO JAMAICA I DECIDED IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO GET MY ENTIRE HEAD BRAIDED. I JUST GOT GLASSES, I BURN EASILY, AND I WAS GOING THROUGH AN AWKWARD STAGE SO LET'S JUST SAY THOSE PICTURES ARE ROUGH. BUT MY FRIENDS AND I GET A KICK OUT OF THEM. I THINK ILL STOP THERE. I WANT TO KEEP SOME OF MY CARDS CLOSE TO MY CHEST[SYMBOL]. BUT WEIRDNESS ASIDE, IM A GIRL WHO LOVES GOD, HER FAMILY & FRIENDS, BEING CREATIVE, AND TRAVELING. SEE WHAT CRAZY THING IM UP TO NEXT MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, AND FRIDAY OF EVERY WEEK @ POST GRAD IN PROGRESS! THANKS FOR LISTENING! HAVE A GREAT DAY, FRIENDS XOXO. THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR POST LAUREN! I ALWAYS LOVE LEARNING MORE ABOUT MY BLOGGER FRIENDS. I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOUR VERY OWN EAT, PRAY, LOVE ADVENTURE NEXT MONTH!
894	SEPT. 06-- IF A SALESMAN COMES TO YOUR DOOR AND SAYS HE'S THERE TO ALERT YOU THAT YOUR CURRENT ALARM COMPANY HAS GONE UNDER OR WAS BOUGHT OUT BY HIS COMPANY, DON'T BUY IT. THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE RECENTLY INVESTIGATED CLAIMS THAT VISION SECURITY OF UTAH WAS MISLEADING HOMEOWNERS IN AN ATTEMPT TO LINE UP NEW BUSINESS. VISION SECURITY DENIED ANY WRONGDOING BUT SETTLED THE CASE RECENTLY BY AGREEING TO PAY A $30,000 FINE AND $5,000 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S PUBLIC PROTECTION AND EDUCATION FUND. IT ALSO AGREED TO ENSURE ITS SALES STAFF IDENTIFIES ITSELF, USES CLEAR CONTRACTS AND DOESN'T MISLEAD CUSTOMERS. VISION SECURITY DID NOT RETURN MY CALL. IN THE SETTLEMENT, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ALLEGED VISION SECURITY VIOLATED THE STATE'S CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW BY COMMITTING "UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES" AND/OR ENGAGING IN "UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION." SALES REPRESENTATIVES "MISREPRESENTED" TO HOMEOWNERS THAT THEIR CURRENT HOME SECURITY SYSTEM PROVIDER WAS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS OR WAS SOLD TO VISION SECURITY; THAT THEY WERE AFFILIATED WITH THE HOMEOWNER'S CURRENT ALARM COMPANY; THAT THE PURPOSE OF THEIR VISIT WAS TO UPGRADE THE CURRENT SECURITY SYSTEM; AND THAT IF THEY SWITCHED SYSTEMS, VISION SECURITY WOULD PAY ANY CANCELLATION FEE, THE SETTLEMENT ALLEGES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SAID VISION SECURITY COOPERATED WITH THE INVESTIGATION AND RESOLVED CUSTOMERS' COMPLAINTS BY CANCELING CONTRACTS. NO CUSTOMERS FROM LEHIGH OR NORTHAMPTON COUNTIES FILED COMPLAINTS, BUT IF ANYONE LOCALLY WAS HIT BY THIS, THERE'S STILL TIME TO SEEK JUSTICE. HOMEOWNERS WHO WERE MISLED INTO SIGNING UP WITH VISION SECURITY AND PAID EARLY TERMINATION FEES TO THEIR PREVIOUS ALARM COMPANY CAN SEEK REFUNDS OF THOSE FEES BY FILING A COMPLAINT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE BY OCT. 9. THE SETTLEMENT ALLOWS PENNSYLVANIA CUSTOMERS WHO SIGNED CONTRACTS WITH VISION SECURITY ON OR AFTER JAN. 1, 2014, TO CANCEL THEIR CONTRACTS AT NO COST. VISION SECURITY IS USED TO INVESTIGATORS ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS SALES PRACTICES. ACCORDING TO ITS BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU REPORT, THE COMPANY HAS SETTLED PROBES BY CONSUMER PROTECTION OFFICES IN OHIO, IDAHO AND FLORIDA IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. IN APRIL, UTAH AUTHORITIES ACCUSED VISION SECURITY OF ENGAGING IN UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND SUSPENDED ITS LICENSE FOR THREE YEARS, ACCORDING TO THE BBB. SUCH ACCUSATIONS AREN'T LIMITED TO THIS COMPANY, THOUGH. A FEW YEARS AGO, A 78-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM ALLENTOWN TOLD ME HE WAS DUPED BY A DECEPTIVE SALES VISIT FROM ANOTHER SECURITY FIRM. HE SAID HE WAS TOLD HIS ALARM COMPANY HAD CLOSED, PROMPTING HIM TO BUY SERVICE FROM THE SALESMAN, A FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT AT A COST OF $2,400. ONLY LATER, WHEN HIS PREVIOUS ALARM COMPANY CONTINUED TAKING AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS FROM HIS BANK ACCOUNT, DID HE REALIZE IT STILL WAS IN BUSINESS AND HE'D BEEN GIVEN THE BUSINESS BY AN UNDERHANDED SALESMAN. HE STOPPED PAYING THE NEW COMPANY AFTER DISCOVERING HE'D BEEN DUPED, AND IT TOLD HIM IT REPORTED HIM TO THE CREDIT BUREAU. I HELPED HIM STRAIGHTEN IT OUT BY CALLING THE NEW MONITORING SERVICE, WHICH AGREED TO CANCEL THE ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SOLD UNDER FALSE PRETENSES. LAST WEEK, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN MISSOURI REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH ANOTHER UTAH ALARM COMPANY, VIVINT, IN A PROBE INTO ITS SALES PRACTICES. VIVINT, FORMERLY KNOWN AS APX ALARM SECURITY SOLUTIONS, AGREED TO PAY $50,000 IN RESTITUTION TO 50 MISSOURI CONSUMERS WHO WERE "HARMED BY THE COMPANY'S DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES," PLUS $15,000 IN FINES, ACCORDING TO A NEWS RELEASE FROM THE MISSOURI ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. CUSTOMERS HAD ALLEGED VIVINT'S DOOR-TO-DOOR SALES PEOPLE MISREPRESENTED THE COMPANY THEY WORKED FOR AND EXAGGERATED LOCAL CRIME RATES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID VIVINT HAD A POLICY OF AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDING CONSUMERS' CONTRACTS FOR A YEAR FOLLOWING THE EXPIRATION OF THE INITIAL CONTRACT TERM. THOSE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT HAVE HIT LOCALLY, TOO. I'VE WRITTEN BEFORE ABOUT ALARM COMPANIES TRYING TO SELL SYSTEMS BY SCARING PEOPLE WITH PHONE CALLS SUPPOSEDLY FROM THE FBI, OR CITING THE FBI, ABOUT CRIME IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. AND AUTO-RENEWING CONTRACTS ALWAYS ARE A CONCERN. MAKE SURE TO READ YOUR TERMS BECAUSE SOME CONTRACTS HAVE CLAUSES THAT LOCK YOU IN AUTOMATICALLY FOR A SERIES OF RENEWALS IF YOU DON'T OPT OUT BY A CERTAIN POINT. IF AN ALARM SALESMAN APPROACHES YOU WITH A STORY ABOUT YOUR ALARM COMPANY CLOSING OR SELLING OUT, DON'T BELIEVE IT. CALL YOUR PROVIDER TO CHECK IT OUT. AS WITH ANY UNSOLICITED SALES CALL, EITHER IN-PERSON OR ON THE PHONE, DON'T MAKE AN IMMEDIATE DECISION. RESEARCH THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE FIRST BY CHECKING OUT ITS REPUTATION ONLINE AND CONSULTING RESOURCES SUCH AS THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU. THE WATCHDOG IS PUBLISHED THURSDAYS AND SUNDAYS.

898	SHEPSHED DYNAMO ARE OUT OF THE FA CUP FOLLOWING A 4-1 DEFEAT AGAINST RUSHALL OLYMPIC.  A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY DEDICATED TO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND QUALITY WORK, TEAM SHEA LLC HAS BEEN SERVING THE GREATER MISSOURI AREA SINCE 2010. THE 1ST QUALIFYING ROUND MATCH HAD TO BE REPLAYED ON TUESDAY AFTER SATURDAYS GAME ENDED IN A GOALLESS TIE. DESPITE DYNAMO TAKING AN EARLY LEAD, RUSHALL, BACK ON THEIR OWN GROUND, PROVIDED A STERNER TEST AND IT IS OLYMPIC WHO WILL TRAVEL TO CORBY TOWN IN THE FA CUP 2ND QUALIFYING ROUND. SHEPSHED OPENED STRONGLY WITH PORTER CLOSE IN THE EARLY MINUTES. THEN ON THREE MINUTES IT COULD BE DEFINED AS A POSSIBLE GAME CHANGING INCIDENT. JAKE BETTS BACK PASS WAS CLEARED BY LAURIE PEARSON BUT WAS CAUGHT BY A LATE TACKLE FROM LUKE BENBOW. AFTER A LENGTHY DELAY WHILE PEARSON RECEIVED TREATMENT, SHEPSHED RESTARTED WITH BETTS GOAL KICK FINDING PORTER WHO SHRUGGED OFF MITCHELL TOLLEY AND MOVED THE BALL INSIDE TO DUFFY. HIS THROUGH BALL FOUND REEVE TO SHOOT PAST DEAN COLEMAN TO GIVE SHEPSHED AN EARLY LEAD. THREE MINUTES LATER, PEARSON WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE AND WAS REPLACED BY ALEX DAVIES. SHEPSHED CAME CLOSE AGAIN ON FIFTEEN MINUTES, REEVE AND LANGHAM COMBINING WELL BUT DUFFYS EFFORT WAS DEFLECTED OVER. SHEPSHED WERE TAKING THE GAME TO RUSHALL AND THEIR ONLY EFFORT OF NOTE WAS ON 17 MINUTES, ALEX REID FINDING LUKE BENBOW BUT HIS SHOT WENT WIDE.  THE COMPANY REMAINS RELAXED ABOUT THE NEW RULES, ONE PERSON FAMILIAR WITH ITS THINKING SAID. DYNAMO HAD FURTHER EFFORTS THROUGH MIVELD AND PORTER GOING CLOSE. RUSHALL BEGAN TO BREAK THE GAME DOWN AND BEGAN TO EXERT THEIR HIGHER LEAGUE INFLUENCE, DAVIES SAVING FROM BENBOW ON 25 MINUTES AND AGAIN THREE MINUTES LATER. RUSHALL EQUALISED ON 37 MINUTES, A DIAGONAL BALL BY TOLLEY CAUGHT OUT THE SHEPSHED DEFENCE AND ROBERTS CURLED HIS RIGHT FOOT SHOT PAST DAVIES. THREE MINUTES LATER AND OLYMPIC WERE IN FRONT, THE BALL WAS FLICKED ON FROM A THROW IN AND ALEX REID HELD THE BALL UP, TURNED AND FIRED PAST DAVIES. SHEPSHED WERE UNLUCKY NOT TO LEVEL STRAIGHT FROM THE KICK OFF, REEVES EFFORT TIPPED ONTO THE POST FOR A CORNER BY COLEMAN. FOUR MINUTES INTO THE HALF RUSHALL EXTENDED THEIR LEAD, REID LATCHING ONTO A THROUGH BALL TO SLOT PAST DAVIES.  SHEPSHED DIDNT GIVE UP AND DUFFY WENT CLOSE WITH A FREE KICK AND MEADE WAS THEN DEEMED OFFSIDE. RUSHALL CONTINUED TO PRESS AND DAVIES PROVIDED A SUCCESSION OF FINE SAVES BEFORE SAM YOUNG BROUGHT DOWN MALACHITE FARQUHARSON FOR A PENALTY BUT DEBUTANTE REPLACEMENT DAVIES IN THE SHEPSHED GOAL WAS EQUAL TO REIDS SPOT KICK. RUSHALL WERE IN SEARCH OF A FIFTH WITH 12 MINUTES TO GO. FARQUHARSONS HEADER LOOKED GOAL BOUND BUT DAVIES PULLED OFF A FINE SAVE TO TIP THE BALL OVER THE TOP. ALTHOUGH THE GAME WAS OUT OF SHEPSHEDS REACH, THEY FINISHED THE GAME STRONG WITH ADAM HOHNS HEADER TIPPED OVER BY COLEMAN AND REEVES PULL BACK CLEARED. ONCE RUSHALL OLYMPIC HAD TAKEN THE LEAD, THEY USED THEIR HIGHER LEAGUE EXPERIENCE TO THEIR ADVANTAGE BUT SHEPSHED CAN TAKE A LOT FROM THE TWO GAMES. ATTENTIONS TURN BACK TO THE MIDLAND FOOTBALL LEAGUE ACTION AS THE TEAM TRAVEL TO HEREFORD ON SATURDAY. TUESDAYS LEAGUE CUP GAME AGAINST LOUGHBOROUGH UNI HAS BEEN REARRANGED AND WILL NOW TAKE PLACE AT THE DOVECOTE ON SEPTEMBER 29.
899	VOICE OF THE PATS PHIL ANDREWS JUST A DAY AWAY FROM THE START OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY SEASON IN THE WHL. THE PATS HEAD TO MOOSE JAW TO TAKE ON THE WARRIORS ON THURSDAY NIGHT AT MOSAIC PLACE AT 7 O'CLOCK ON 620 CKRM. THE PATS HAVE A TOTAL OF 10 ROOKIES ON THEIR ROSTER, FIVE OF WHICH HAVE NEVER SET FOOT ON THE ICE IN A WHL REGULAR SEASON GAME. FORWARDS LANE ZABLOCKI, RILEY WOODS AND DEFENCEMEN JARED FREADRICH AND NIKOLAI KNYZHOV COULD ALL GET THEIR FIRST GAMES IN THE LEAGUE ON THURSDAY. TRYGVE MANY GUNS HAS NOT PLAYED A GAME EITHER BUT HE WAS SUSPENDED THREE GAMES BY THE WHL ON TUESDAY FOR HIS CHARGING MAJOR AGAINST THE PRINCE ALBERT RAIDERS. FREADRICH HAS BEEN USED ON THE POWERPLAY IN PRACTICE THIS WEEK ON THE BLUE LINE. THE 17-YEAR-OLD, 4TH ROUND PICK SAYS HE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THURSDAY NIGHT. "PRETTY EXCITED, A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS. BEEN WAITING FOR THAT DAY SINCE I CAME TO CAMP HERE... IT WILL BE EXCITING TO SEE HOW I DO AND I AM GLAD THEY ARE GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW WHAT I CAN DO ON THE POWERPLAY AND CHIP IN OFFENSIVELY." FREADRICH WHO PLAYED IN THE AJHL WITH THE WHITECOURT WOLVERINES AS A 16-YEAR-OLD LAST YEAR AND HAD 11 POINTS AND 59 PENALTY MINUTES IN 45 GAMES. HE SAYS HAVING ALREADY PLAYED JUNIOR AND NOW HAVING ANOTHER WHL TRAINING CAMP UNDER HIS BELT, HE IS READY TO MAKE THE JUMP. "I THINK EVERY PRE-SEASON GAME I'VE GOTTEN MORE COMFORTABLE OUT THERE AND PLAYING WITH GUYS FOR LONGER TIMES YOU GET TO KNOW HOW THEY ARE LIKE AND EVERYTHING GETS MORE COMFORTABLE AS TIME GOES ON." ASSISTANT COACH AND ASSISTANT GM DAVE STRUCH SAYS HE'S EARNED HIS SHOT. "WE EXPECT A LOT OF ALL OF THESE GUYS AND SEEING HIM IN THE SPRING CAMP, HIS SKATING, THE IMPROVEMENT THERE WAS REALLY ENORMOUS FOR HIM. IT MADE US RETHINK WHERE WE WANTED TO POSITION HIM IN OUR LINEUP. HE'S HERE, HE'S MADE THE TEAM AND HE IS GOING TO GET A GOOD OPPORTUNITY. AS IS EVERYBODY AT THE YOUNG AGE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WE PLAY ALL OF OUR GUYS FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES. THEY GET A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO FAIL AND KEEP FAILING AND THEN GROW AND HAVE SOME SUCCESSES AND GET CONSISTENT WITH IT." STRUCH HAD SOME HIGH PRAISE FOR FREADRICH, COMPARING HIM TO AN NHL DRAFT PICK AND FORMER PATS CAPTAIN. "EVER SINCE THE FIRST TIME WE SAW HIM SKATE AT THE START OF THE YEAR HERE HE LOOKS A LOT LIKE A YOUNG KYLE BURROUGHS IN HIS GAME. WHEN I WAS COACHING IN SASKATOON TO SEE HIM YOU COULD SEE THERE WERE SOME ATTRIBUTES THERE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU LOOK FORWARD TOO AS FAR AS THE GROWTH OF THE PROGRAM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF JARED SO THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TOO IN A COUPLE YEARS." PUCK DROP TOMORROW NIGHT IS AT 7 O'CLOCK ON 620 CKRM WITH THE PRE-GAME SHOW AT 6:35. THE PATS WILL HOST THEIR HOME OPENER ON SATURDAY NIGHT AGAINST MOOSE JAW AT THE BRANDT CENTRE, ALSO AT 7 PM. - THE MOOSE JAW WARRIORS HAVE UNVEILED THEIR THROWBACK JERSEYS FOR OPENING WEEKEND. WE WILL GET OUR FIRST LOOK AT THE REGINA PATS VINTAGE JERSEYS COME THURSDAY NIGHT. THEY LOOK REALLY SHARP AND WILL BE AUCTIONED OFF AFTER THE PATS HOME OPENER ON SATURDAY. - THE WHL RELEASED ITS TOP 125 PLAYERS OF ALL TIME YESTERDAY. YOU CAN FIND THE LIST BY CLICKING HERE. IT WAS COMPILED WITH THE HELP OF GREGG DRINNAN, NORM DUECK, PETER LOUBARDIAS, BOB RIDLEY, DAN RUSSELL, ROB VANSTONE, DEAN VROOMAN AND BILL WILLMS. THERE ARE 10 REGINA PATS ALUMNI THAT MADE THE LIST. - FORMER REGINA PATS FORWARD PATRICK D'AMICO IS SPENDING SOME TIME IN THE QUEEN CITY THIS WEEK AHEAD OF HIS FIRST PRO TRAINING CAMP WITH THE COLORADO EAGLES OF THE ECHL. THE WINNIPEG PRODUCT SKATED WITH THE PATS EARLIER THIS WEEK (SHOWN WEARING YELLOW). JEEZE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE HIM BACK FOR ANOTHER YEAR BUT WISHING HIM ALL THE BEST IN HIS FIRST SEASON DOWN SOUTH. - NOW TO FOOTBALL AND I WANT TO START WITH FORMER REGINA THUNDER QB AND NATIONAL CHAMPION ASHER HASTINGS. THE REGINA PRODUCT IS PLAYING WITH MCMASTER UNIVERSITY AND IN HIS FIRST THREE STARTS HAS THROWN FOR 1081 YARDS WHICH IS THIRD IN THE COUNTRY AND HAS THE MOST TOUCHDOWN PASSES WITH 13. SO GOOD TO SEE HIM SUCCEED. HE CAME TO MIND THIS WEEK WHEN DALLAS COWBOYS PIVOT TONY ROMO WENT DOWN WITH A BROKEN COLLARBONE AND WILL MISS 8 WEEKS. HASTINGS DID THE SAME THING IN HIS SECOND TO LAST YEAR WITH THE THUNDER. BROKE HIS COLLARBONE CLEAR IN TWO (I WISH I STILL HAD THE X-RAY PHOTO TO SHOW YOU), AND HE RETURNED TO THE FIELD JUST 5 WEEKS LATER. MAYBE COWBOYS FANS WON'T HAVE TO WAIT AS LONG AS THEY THINK FOR THEIR FRANCHISE QB TO RETURN. OR MAYBE ASHER IS JUST A FREAK OF NATURE. -THE REGINA THUNDER GOT BACK ON TRACK SUNDAY IN WINNIPEG WITH A 51-22 WIN OVER THE RIFLES AT INVESTORS GROUP FIELD. QB JAEDEN MARWICK THREW THREE MORE TOUCHDOWNS AND SITS WITH 17 IN 6 GAMES WHICH LEADS THE PFC. THE THUNDER ARE ON A BYE THIS WEEK AND WILL TAKE ON THE CALGARY COLTS IN WEEK 8 IN A BATTLE FOR SECOND PLACE. - THE GREEN BAY PACKERS EXERCISED SOME DEMONS ON SUNDAY NIGHT BEATING THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS AND LAMBEAU FIELD. IT WAS A HECK OF A FOOTBALL GAME AND ONCE AGAIN AARON RODGERS CAME THROUGH CLUTCH IN THE 4TH QUARTER. WHAT'S BEEN A REAL SURPRISE IS THE PLAY OF THE DEFENCE AS WELL COMPARED TO PREVIOUS YEARS. THEY ARE FORCING TURNOVERS AT KEY TIMES IN GAMES AND ALL BUT BOTTLED P MARSHAWN LYNCH ON SUNDAY NIGHT. FOR GOOD REASON THEY ARE ATOP THE POWER RANKINGS IN THE NFL AFTER 2 WEEKS. BIG MONDAY NIGHT GAME AGAINST KANSAS CITY IN WEEK 3. - I REALLY WISH THE RIDERS WERE NOT PLAYING SUNDAY, THE CFL SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM SUNDAY GAMES ONCE THE NFL HAS STARTED. - LOTS OF TALK ABOUT IF THE GREEN AND WHITE SHOULD TRADE KEVIN GLENN TO THE HAMILTON TIGER-CATS AFTER ZACH COLLAROS WAS LOST FOR THE SEASON. IF HAMILTON WANTS HIM, WHICH 'M NOT SURE THEY DO, THEN I THINK THE ONLY WAY THE RIDERS MAKE THE TRADE IS IF IT'S QUITE THE RETURN FOR SASKATCHEWAN. SURE THESE LAST 6 GAMES OF THE SEASON ARE A WRITE OFF HOWEVER, IF DARIAN DURANT IS NOT READY WEEK ONE NEXT YEAR THEN YOU NEED GLENN TO BE BACK FOR ANOTHER YEAR. SURE FREE AGENCY COULD CHANGE ALL OF THAT BUT HE IS A VALUABLE ASSET FOR THIS TEAM NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR TODAY. HAVE A GREAT WEEK AND TALK TO YOU FROM MOOSE JAW TOMORROW NIGHT. PHIL @PHILTHETHRILL18

901	A RECENT CLAIM FROM A STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT ALPHA TESTER HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE GAME IS BROKEN AND THAT IT IS RUSHED BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF THE MOVIE, EPISODE 7: THE FORCE AWAKENS THIS DECEMBER. DO PLAYERS HAVE TO START WORRYING ABOUT THE QUALITY OF STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WHEN IT RELEASES THIS NOVEMBER AND DO THE CLAIMS HOLD ANY MERIT, OR IS IT THE DARK SIDE OF THE FORCE AT WORK? HERE IS WHY RECENT CLAIMS BY A SUPPOSED ALPHA TESTER SHOULDNT GET YOU TOO WORRIED. THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT FIRST AND FOREMOST, THERE WILL BE AN OPEN BETA COMING IN EARLY OCTOBER. I RECENTLY REPORTED ON THE OPEN BETA AND ASKED IF A BETA OPEN TO EVERYONE COULD BE A SIGN OF OVERCONFIDENCE ON EAS PART. IF YOUVE BEEN ON THE FENCE ABOUT BUYING THE GAME, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF WITHOUT ANY KIND OF MONETARY INVESTMENT (EXCEPT FOR DOWNLOADING THE BETA, THE SIZE OF WHICH IS NOT CONFIRMED. IF STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WAS REALLY A BUG FILLED MESS, THEN AN OPEN BETA WOULD BE THE WORST POSSIBLE DECISION FROM EA AND DICE. IM NOT SAYING THE BETA WILL BE PERFECT, BUT TO THINK THAT THE DEVELOPER AND PUBLISHER WILL HOST AN OPEN BETA FOR A BROKEN GAME IS PREPOSTEROUS. THE SECOND IMPORTANT ASPECT TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE CLAIMS COME FROM AN ALPHA TEST, NOT BETA. ALPHA TEST VERSIONS ARE GENERALLY BUG FILLED MESSES, AS IT IS A VERY EARLY BUILD OF THE GAME TO TEST FUNCTIONALITY. IF THE QUALITY OF A RELEASE VERSION OF ANY GAME WAS DETERMINED BY AN ALPHA TEST VERSION, EVERY GAME RELEASE WOULD BE A BROKEN MESS. FURTHERMORE, EA IS SEEMINGLY DOING A GOOD JOB WITH THE MULTIPLAYER, AS GARETH WOODS TRIED THE SQUADRON FIGHTER MODE LAST MONTH AND PRAISED THE GAME MODE FOR ITS AUTHENTIC FEELING AND FAST PACED ACTION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MR. WOODS DID NOT MENTION ANY BUGS OR ANYTHING GAME-BREAKING. NEOGAF USER ILLUCIO CLAIMS: I'VE BEEN ALPHA TESTING A FEW GAMES AND I CAN SAY BATTLEFRONT IS A COMPLETE MESS AND IS BROKEN. CONSIDERING THAT THEIR DEADLINE FOR THE GAME IS IN A FEW WEEKS AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T FIXED THE MAJORITY OF THE IN GAME PROBLEMS LET ALONE THE CONNECTION PROBLEM ME AND OTHER TESTERS WERE HAVING, YES IT'S GOING TO BE A MESS. AND EVEN A DAY 1 PATCH WON'T FIX ALL OF THEM, I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH OUTSIDE WHAT I PLAYED, BUT THE GAME IS INDEED RUSHED AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF EPISODE 7 RELEASING THIS DECEMBER. AND IN RETROSPECT I ALSO TESTED BLACK OPS 3 WHICH EVEN THOUGH IT HAD MANY PROBLEMS, IT WAS NO WHERE AS BAD AS BATTLEFRONT. SOURCE DO PLAYERS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED? IF YOU TAKE A LOOK BACK AT BATTLEFIELD 4'S LAUNCH, THEY DO HAVE A REASON NOT TO TRUST EA. MY NICHOLAS HOLDEN COLLEAGUE REPORTED MULTIPLE BATTLEFIELD 4 ISSUES, PC VERSION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY. HOWEVER, THE LATEST ENTRY IN THE BATTLEFIELD FRANCHISE, BATTLEFIELD: HARDLINE HAD AN EXCELLENT LAUNCH, AS I NOTED IN MY REVIEW THAT THE GAME WAS BASICALLY BUG FREE. IS THE BUG FREE STATE OF HARDLINE AT LAUNCH THE START OF A QUALITY LAUNCH TREND BY EA? HOPEFULLY. THE NEOGAF THREAD IN QUESTION IS ENTITLED QA TESTERS WARN: BROKEN GAMES FIASCO OF LAST YEAR MAY REPEAT THIS CHRISTMAS . ATTACHED IS A POLL ON WHICH AAA GAME, COMING THIS HOLIDAY, THE COMMUNITY THINKS WILL HAVE THE MOST BUGS. AT THE TIME OF WRITING, FALLOUT 4 IS ON TOP OF THE POLL, WITH ASSASSINS CREED: SYNDICATE IN SECOND PLACE AND STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT IN THIRD. HAVE PLAYERS LOST THEIR FAITH IN AAA GAME DEVELOPERS TO DELIVER A QUALITY, BUG FREE TITLE? IT SURE LOOKS THAT WAY. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING SCEPTICAL ABOUT A PRODUCT WHEN PREVIOUS TITLES BY A COMPANY HAVE HAD LESS THAN IDEAL LAUNCHES. HOWEVER, ITS ALSO NOT GOOD TO ALWAYS HAVE A GLASS HALF EMPTY OUTLOOK. I FOR ONE AM GIVING STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND WILL JUDGE THE GAME DURING THE OPEN BETA AND SUBSEQUENT FULL RELEASE. [EMBEDDED CONTENT] IN THE VIDEO ABOVE, YOU CAN SEE SOME ALPHA FOOTAGE IN ACTION, WHICH DOESNT LOOK BUGGY AT ALL. IF THERE IS ANY MERIT TO THE CLAIMS BY NEOGAF USER ILLUCIO, HOPEFULLY EA AND DICE WILL HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO FIX THE GAME BEFORE IT IS RELEASE. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT AN ALPHA VERSION OF THE GAME IS A LONG WAY OFF FULL RELEASE. STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WILL RELEASE ON PC, PLAYSTATION 4 AND XBOX ONE: NORTH AMERICA - NOVEMBER 17 EUROPE - NOVEMBER 19 (USUALLY SA RELEASE DATE AS WELL) UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 20 DO YOU THINK STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT WILL BE BROKEN ON RELEASE OR WILL THE GAME HAVE LITTLE TO NO BUGS AT LAUNCH? LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK IN THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW. SOURCE: NEOGAF READ MORE ABOUT STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT: SILLICUR TWITTER /

905	IN 2014, NATIONAL COUNCIL ON AND DRUG DEPENDENCE OF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, INC. (NCADD OF MIDDLESEX), INC. INITIATED QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH EFFORTS EXAMINE CURRENT AWARENESS AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE AGENCYS BRAND IDENTITY; POTENTIAL BARRIERS WITH THE BRAND NAME; AND, WHAT THE AGENCY NEEDED TO IMPROVE ITS BRAND IDENTITY TO ONE THAT MORE CLOSELY RESONATES WITH ITS TARGET AUDIENCES AS WELL AS CURRENT AND FUTURE EFFORTS THE AGENCY IMPLEMENTS.  THIS IS WHAT YOU SEE WHEN SURFACE SEARCHING. WE LEARNED THAT: THE NCADD NAME CREATES CONFUSION AS TO WHETHER THE ORGANIZATION IS NATIONAL OR LIMITED TO MIDDLESEX COUNTY; ONE OF NCADDS PRIMARY FUNCTIONS IS PREVENTION, WHICH IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE NAME; AND, THE NCADD LOGO IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AGENCY AND WHAT IT DOES. THE RESULT OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS IS OUR NEW NAME, THE WELLNESS CENTER FOR PREVENTION, SAID BOARD OF TRUSTEES PRESIDENT JEFF JANNARONE.  THE COMPANY EARNED $98.40 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER, COMPARED TO THE CONSENSUS ESTIMATE OF $95.15 MILLION. NOW, ADDED JANNARONE, OUR NEW TAGLINE REPRESENTS THE AGENCYS COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING HEALTHY LIVING THROUGH EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND ADVOCACY. THE WORD WELLSPRING IT IS A REAL WORD, BUT IT PLAYS OFF WELLNESS (PREVENTION) AND SOURCE (RESOURCE AND THE SOURCE OF THE BEST INFORMATION) WE PROVIDE THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, NOTED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR EZRA HELFAND. OUR NEW NAME INVOKES A BOTTOM-UP ORGANIC APPROACH. WELLSPRING REPRESENTS THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT SOME BIG, IMPERSONAL INSTITUTION. WE COME FROM A LOCAL PLACE AND DEVELOP IDEAS, SERVICES, AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE THEN SCALABLE TO WIDER AUDIENCES, BUT ARE GROUNDED IN THE WORK WE DO IN COMMUNITIES. HELFAND SAID THAT WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES.  NEW RULES, THEY ARGUE, WOULD MAKE IT HARDER TO TRADE AND COULD CAUSE SOME TO LEAVE THE MARKET, MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR AIRLINES, UTILITIES AND OTHERS TO MANAGE THEIR EXPOSURE TO COMMODITIES PRICES--COSTS THAT ULTIMATELY WOULD BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS. WE CHANGE PEOPLES LIVES THROUGH PREVENTION EDUCATION AND POSITIVE COMMUNITY CHANGE. SINCE 1980, NCADD/WELLSPRING HAS BEEN PROVIDING A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES THAT FEATURE: AN EVER-EXPANDING ARRAY OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT COURSES FOR ADDICTION COUNSELORS, PREVENTION SPECIALISTS, SCHOOL FACULTY, AND SCHOOL STAFF.  SERVICES FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND THE WELLBEING OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. FAR FROM TELLING YOUTH TO JUST SAY NO, WE PLEDGE TO ONLY PROVIDE SERVICES THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE CHANGE BEHAVIOR FOR THE BETTER. EFFORTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE, ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUTH.  "THE STRENGTH OF SOCIAL MEDIA TODAY IS THAT IT CAN TELL GOVERNMENTS WHERE THEY ARE GOING WRONG AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A COURSE CORRECTION." "YOU WILL GAIN FROM JOINING IT. WE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASED COLLABORATION AND PLANNING COORDINATION, AND SHARING OF RESOURCES, THEREBY MAXIMIZING THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS OF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, AND BEYOND. THE COALITION FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES IS WHERE WE BRING TOGETHER PROFESSIONALS FROM MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES THAT HAVE A PASSION FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND OTHER SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR NEW COMPANY NAME, CONCLUDED HELFAND. WE BELIEVE THE NAME WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION ALLOWS US TO BETTER REPRESENT WHO WE ARE AND WILL ENABLE US TO OFFER AND INTRODUCE NEW SERVICES. CHANGING OUR NAME TO WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION FINALIZES AN ONGOING SHIFT IN CORPORATE STRATEGY THAT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, ADDED JANNARONE. WHILE WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN WHAT WEVE ACCOMPLISHED TO-DATE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND INNOVATE. THE NEW NAME IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, AND WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE AGENCYS PRODUCT AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE CALENDAR YEAR 2015 AND THROUGH EARLY 2016.

906	UNTIL NOW, THE SIHH, THE GENEVA-BASED JANUARY WATCH FAIR, WAS KNOWN TO BE A VERY LUXURIOUS EXHIBITION MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE RICHEMONT GROUP BRANDS. THE FHH, FONDATION DE LA HAUTE HORLOGERIE AND HOST OF THE SIHH, JUST DECIDED TO CHANGE THE FORMAT, FIRST BY BRINGING A NEW ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPT BUT MAINLY BY ADDING TO THE LIST OF THE EXHIBITING MAISONS 9 INDEPENDENT WATCHMAKERS AND NOT THE WORST ONES TO BE HONEST.

WITH THE FREE SPACE LET AFTER RALPH LAURENS DEPARTURE, THESE BRANDS WILL NOW OFFICIALLY BE PART OF THE SIHH. FABIENNE LUPO, CEO OFFONDATION DE LA HAUTE HORLOGERIE, EXPLAINS THE DECISION IN BILAN.CH (IN FRENCH): WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR SEVERAL YEARS.THE SIHH HAD ALREADY OPENED ITS DOORS TO INDEPENDENT WATCHMAKERS, IN 1998, WHEN THE SHOW WAS STILL IN HALL 07 OFPALEXPO. FOR EXAMPLE,ROGER DUBUIS HAD STARTED LIKE THIS.THE IDEA TO HIGHLIGHT SUCHWATCHMAKING TALENTS IS NOT NEW.HOWEVER,FOR TECHNICAL REASONS AND THE EXISTENCE OF PARALLEL EXHIBITIONS WHICH WERE ORGANIZED ON THE SIDELINES OF THE SIHH IN GENEVA, THIS INITIATIVE HAD NEVER MATERIALIZED AS IT WILL BE IN 2016. RALPH LAURENS DEPARTURE WAS THE TRIGGER.A FREE SPACE WE HAVE THEREFORE UTILIZED TO CREATE THIS NEW CARR DES HORLOGERS. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SIHH WITH NOW 24 BRANDS WITH SUCH A HIGHLY QUALITATIVE SELECTION WILL DEFINITELY CREATE A MAGNIFICENT EVENT, FROM WHICH WELL OF COURSE REPORT LIVE. RELATED

908	A BRIDGEPORT MAN ATTEMPTED A CREATIVE GETAWAY FROM POLICE THURSDAY, BUT HE ENDED UP JAILED ANYWAY. DANIEL SANCHEZ BARBOZA BRIDGEPORT ASSISTANT POLICE CHIEF STEVE STANFORD SAID AN OFFICER ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A TRAFFIC STOP IN THE AREA OF GREATHOUSE AND THIRD STREETS AROUND 2:30 P.M. BECAUSE THE OFFICER KNEW THE DRIVER, DANIEL SANCHEZ BARBOZA, 26, HAD A MISDEMEANOR WARRANT. BARBOZA, WHO LIVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, DROVE OFF IN A PICKUP TRUCK IN THE DIRECTION OF FIRST STREET. WHEN HE GOT TO THE RAILROAD TRACKS, HE TURNED RIGHT AND STARTED DRIVING DOWN THE TRACKS. THESE ARE BASICALLY ABANDONED RAILROAD TRACKS, STANFORD SAID. HE RAN DOWN ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE AND WRECKED ON THE TRACKS. AT THAT POINT, BARBOZA LEFT HIS TRUCK ON THE TRACKS AND RAN IN A NORTHWEST DIRECTION INTO THE WOODS AT THE SOUTHWEST EDGE OF THE CITY. OFFICERS FROM THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE WISE COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE HELPED SET UP A PERIMETER IN AN ATTEMPT TO CATCH THE MAN. THE BRIDGEPORT FIRE DEPARTMENT AND WISE COUNTY EMS WERE ALSO CALLED TO THE SCENE FOR POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE, AS WELL AS THE SHERIFFS OFFICE K-9 UNIT TO TRACK DOWN AND APPREHEND BARBOZA. HE WAS BAREFOOT AND FOUND LAYING IN A FETAL POSITION IN A HEAVILY WOODED AREA, STANFORD SAID, ADDING BARBOZA PROBABLY RAN CLOSE TO A MILE ON FOOT. THE SUSPECT WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY WITHOUT FURTHER RESISTANCE. OFFICERS SEARCHED HIS TRUCK AND FOUND BOTH DRUGS AND DRUG-RELATED ITEMS. BARBOZA WAS ARRESTED FOR THE ORIGINAL WARRANT DRIVING WITH LICENSE INVALID WITH PREVIOUS CONVICTION AS WELL AS DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED THIRD OR MORE, POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA LESS THAN 2 OUNCES, EVADING ARREST OR DETENTION WITH PREVIOUS CONVICTION, EVADING ARREST OR DETENTION WITH A VEHICLE, EXPIRED LICENSE PLATES, TRESPASSING ON RAILROAD PROPERTY AND POSSESSION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA. HE REMAINED IN THE WISE COUNTY JAIL FRIDAY WITH TOTAL BOND SET AT $99,000. AFTER THE CHASE, MEDICS WERE CALLED TO CHECK ON THE OFFICERS WHO PUSHED THROUGH THE THICK BRUSH DURING THEIR SEARCH. NO SERIOUS INJURIES TO THE SUSPECT OR OFFICERS WERE REPORTED. POLICE AND MEDICS CLEARED THE SCENE JUST AS CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WERE BEING DROPPED OFF BY THE SCHOOL BUS. STANFORD DEEMED THE OPERATION A SUCCESS. IT WAS GREAT TEAMWORK BY ALL THE AGENCIES INVOLVED, STANFORD SAID. THE BAD GUY WENT TO JAIL, AND NOBODY WAS HURT.
909	BEIJING, SEPT. 29 (XINHUA) -- AS CHINA IS INTEGRATING MORE DEEPLY IN THE WORLD ORDER, ITS COMMITMENT WILL BE SHOWN WITH MORE PRACTICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE EXISTING INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. ONE OF ITS GIFTS WILL BE TO THE UNITED NATIONS . ADDRESSING THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON MONDAY, PRESIDENT XI JINPING SAID CHINA WILL BUILD AN 8,000-STRONG STANDBY PEACEKEEPING FORCE. HE ADDED THAT THE COUNTRY WILL JOIN THE NEW UN PEACEKEEPING CAPABILITY READINESS SYSTEM, AND TAKE THE LEAD IN SETTING UP A PERMANENT PEACEKEEPING POLICE SQUAD. CHINA HAS BEEN CONTRIBUTING TO PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS SINCE 1990. AS IT HAS GOT STRONGER OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS, ITS PEACEKEEPING PRESENCE HAS GROWN, WITH MORE PERSONNEL AND DIVERSIFIED TASKS. CHINA HAS ALREADY BECOME THE BIGGEST PEACEKEEPING CONTRIBUTOR AMONG THE FIVE UN SECURITY COUNCIL PERMANENT MEMBERS IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF PERSONNEL. ACCORDING TO CHINA'S MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE, OVER 30,000 CHINESE PEACEKEEPERS HAVE SERVED OVERSEAS, WITH 10 OF THEM LOSING THEIR LIVES. THE COUNTRY HAS TAKEN PART IN 24 UN PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS IN THE PAST 25 YEARS. OF THE CURRENT 16 MISSIONS, CHINESE PEACEKEEPERS ARE INVOLVED IN NINE. IN SOUTH SUDAN, SOUTH LEBANON, LIBERIA AND OTHER MISSION AREAS, CHINESE PEACEKEEPERS ARE BUILDING ROADS, CLEARING MINES AND TREATING LOCAL PATIENTS, SHOWING THEIR EXPERTISE AND BUILDING FRIENDSHIPS. AS ONE OF THE MAJOR MISSIONS OF THE UN, PEACEKEEPING IS A TASK OF VITAL IMPORTANCE IN THE CURRENT SITUATION, IN WHICH THE WORLD IS FACING REGIONAL AND ETHNIC CONFLICTS, HUMANITARIAN CRISES AND OTHER CHALLENGES. THE UN IS THE MAJOR GLOBAL INSTITUTION FOR PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT. BY SUPPORTING IT, CHINA IS NOT ONLY HELPING VULNERABLE COUNTRIES ADDRESS THEIR DIFFICULTIES, BUT ALSO SUPPORTING THE EXISTING WORLD ORDER, RATHER THAN CREATING A NEW ONE TO EDGE IT OUT. XI SAID IN THE ADDRESS THAT CHINA WILL CONSIDER THE UN'S REQUEST OF SENDING MORE ENGINEERING, TRANSPORTATION AND MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO JOIN PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS, AND WILL TRAIN 2,000 FOREIGN PEACEKEEPERS AND CARRY OUT 10 MINE-SWEEPING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. CHINA'S INCREASING ROLE IN PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS HAS CONFIRMED XI'S ASSERTION THAT CHINA IS A PARTICIPATOR, CONSTRUCTOR, CONTRIBUTOR AS WELL AS A BENEFICIARY OF THE EXISTING INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. AS THE COUNTRY IS ADVOCATING A NEW TYPE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS OF WIN-WIN COOPERATION, ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UN AND THE CURRENT WORLD ORDER WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE.

914	SOCIOPATH. FIERCE. LOYAL. INFORMANT. FATHER. EACH OF THESE WORDS COULD BE USED TO DESCRIBE JAMES "WHITEY" BULGER - THE NOTORIOUSLY VICIOUS SOUTH BOSTON GANGSTER AND HEAD OF THE WINTER HILL GANG. THOSE WORDS ALSO SERVE AS THE MOST INTRIGUING UNDERCURRENTS OF "BLACK MASS," WHICH DELIVERS A PORTRAIT OF A RUTHLESS AND VIOLENT MAN WHO IS ALSO A CARING BROTHER AND A GRIEVING FATHER. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT CERTAIN OF THOSE QUALITIES IN ANY WAY MITIGATE THE REIGN OF TERROR BULGER BROUGHT DOWN ON BOSTON IN THE 1970S AND 1980S - THEY DO NOT - BUT THEY DO PROVIDE A WINDOW INTO A MAN WHO, LIKE THE REST OF US, IS PERHAPS MORE COMPLEX THAN HE WOULD SEEM AT FIRST GLANCE. BASED ON THE METICULOUSLY RESEARCHED BOOK BLACK MASS: WHITEY BULGER, THE FBI, AND THE DEVIL'S DEAL BY DICK LEHR AND GERARD O'NEILL, THE FILM FOCUSES ON THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN BULGER AND FBI AGENT JOHN CONNOLLY (PLAYED BY AN INCREASINGLY CHAMELEON-LIKE JOEL EDGERTON) BEGINNING IN 1975. DIRECTED BY SCOTT COOPER ("CRAZY HEART," THE UNDERRATED "OUT OF THE FURNACE"), THE FILM RELIES ON AN ARGUABLY CAREER-BEST PERFORMANCE FROM JOHNNY DEPP AS THE PREDATORY AND AT TIMES TERRIFYING BULGER. IT'S THE SORT OF QUIETLY CONFIDENT, LESS-IS-MORE PERFORMANCE THAT ONE CAN EASILY FORGET DEPP IS CAPABLE OF. RATHER THAN TURNING BULGER INTO A HEDONISTIC CARICATURE (SEE JACK NICHOLSON IN "THE DEPARTED"), DEPP CREATES A MENACING AND CHARISMATIC MAN WHO EVOKES UNRELENTING LOYALTY FROM THOSE AROUND HIM AND DEMANDS JUST THAT. THE FILM IS PRESENTED IN THREE ACTS BEGINNING WITH BULGER'S RISE ON THE STREETS OF BOSTON IN THE 1970S, MOVING TO THE EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND EXPANSION OF HIS CRIMINAL EMPIRE IN THE EARLY 1980S, AND FINISHING WITH HIS EVENTUAL DOWNFALL BEGINNING IN 1987 AND SPIRALING DOWN TO HIS FUGITIVE RUN IN 1994. COOPER EMPLOYS THE UNDERSTATED STYLE HE CULTIVATED WITH "CRAZY HEART" AND "OUT OF THE FURNACE" - RELYING LARGELY ON MOODY AND WELL-PHOTOGRAPHED SHOTS TO SET A TONE AND HIS TALENTED CAST TO DO THE HEAVY LIFTING - ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MORE THAN A FEW NODS TO MARTIN SCORSESE, NOT LEAST OBVIOUS BEING THE SOUNDTRACK. IN THE FILM'S OPENING SCENES, FBI AGENT AND SOUTH BOSTON NATIVE JOHN CONNOLLY TRIUMPHANTLY RETURNS TO THE BOSTON BUREAU AFTER CAREER-MAKING STINTS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND NEW YORK. CHARGED WITH TAKING DOWN THE ANGIULO CRIME FAMILY, CONNOLLY SETS OUT TO TURN HIS CHILDHOOD FRIEND AND HERO, JAMES "WHITEY" BULGER, INTO AN INFORMANT. BULGER WILL PROVIDE INTEL ON THE ANGIULOS TO THE FBI AND THE FBI WILL LOOK PAST HIS CRIMINAL DEALINGS. IN CONNOLLY'S WORDS, IT WILL BE A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ALLIANCE. THIS UNHOLY ALLIANCE SITS FIRMLY AT THE CENTER OF THE ACTION AS BULGER MANIPULATES A WILLING CONNOLLY TO STEP FURTHER INTO AN AMORAL RABBIT HOLE. AS BULGER AND HIS RIGHT-HAND MEN - STEVE FLEMMI (RORY COCHRANE), KEVIN WEEKS (JESSE PLEMONS), AND HITMAN JOHN MARTORANO (W. EARL BROWN) - TIGHTEN THEIR GRIP ON THE BOSTON UNDERWORLD AND BEYOND, CONNOLLY FALSIFIES REPORTS, FEEDS INFORMATION, AND GENERALLY BLUSTERS HIS WAY THROUGH AN ELABORATE SHELL GAME TO SHIELD BULGER FROM THE INCREASINGLY SKEPTICAL EYES OF FELLOW AGENT ROBERT FITZPATRICK (ADAM SCOTT) AND HIS SUPERIOR, CHARLES MCGUIRE (KEVIN BACON). "BLACK MASS" TRACKS CONNOLLY'S INCREASING FASCINATION WITH AND EVER-GROWING LOYALTY TO BULGER (THE ACTUAL CONNOLLY REFUSED TO TESTIFY AGAINST BULGER AND IS SERVING FORTY YEARS IN PRISON AS A RESULT), SETTING IT ALONGSIDE THE ALMOST PRETERNATURAL CALM AND APPARENT DICHOTOMY OF WHITEY BULGER. ON ONE HAND BULGER IS A REPREHENSIBLE AND REMORSELESS CRIMINAL; ON THE OTHER HAND HE IS A GRIEVING FATHER, A LOVING SON WHO HELPS OLD LADIES TAKE THEIR GROCERIES IN, AND A DEVOTED BROTHER. ON THAT NOTE, IF THERE IS ONE GLARING WEAKNESS TO "BLACK MASS," IT WOULD BE THE LACK OF TIME SPENT FLESHING OUT THE INTRIGUING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHITEY BULGER AND HIS BROTHER BILLY (BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH) - A PROMINENT STATE POLITICIAN WHO WOULD EVENTUALLY SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS STATE SENATE. DESPITE ITS TAUT AND INTRIGUING TRUE LIFE TALE OF THE RISE OF A VICIOUS GANGSTER MADE POSSIBLE BY STARTLING FBI CORRUPTION, JOHNNY DEPP IS THE UNDENIABLE CENTERPIECE OF "BLACK MASS" AND ITS STELLAR CAST. DEPP PORTRAYS BULGER WITH A RESERVED INTENSITY. HIS PORTRAYAL OF BULGER BENEFITS GREATLY FROM DEPP'S NATURAL CHARISMA TO BE SURE, BUT THE REAL STORY LIES IN DEPP'S ABILITY TO CONVEY THE UNDERCURRENT OF CALCULATED RAGE AND MENACE JUST UNDER BULGER'S SKIN. THERE'S AN UNPREDICTABILITY IN THIS PERFORMANCE DESPITE THE CALCULATED TONE THAT DEPP STRIKES. RELYING ON HIS TALENTED CAST, COMPELLING TRUE CRIME PREMISE, AND BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE FROM JOHNNY DEPP, SCOTT COOPER HAS CREATED A RIVETING AND TENSE FILM THAT MAY TOE A WELL-WORN GENRE LINE - BUT TOES IT OH SO WELL. THE POST A GANGSTER MOVIE LIKE NO OTHER: 'BLACK MASS' APPEARED FIRST ON WORD AND FILM .
915	IN THE COMEDY WORLD, IT'S A COMMONLY HELD BELIEF THAT THERE'S A DARK SIDE TO BEING FUNNY AND KELLY CARLIN IS LIVING PROOF. THE DAUGHTER OF THE LATE COMIC GENIUS GEORGE CARLIN HAS JUST WRITTEN A MEMOIR ABOUT HER CHILDHOOD. IT'S CALLED A CARLIN HOME COMPANION , BUT IT'S NOTHING LIKE WHAT YOU'D FIND ON LAKE WOBEGON. IN HER BOOK, KELLY WRITES THAT HER PARENTS, GEORGE AND BRENDA, COULD NEVER BE ACCUSED OF HOVERING OVER THEIR ONLY CHILD. IN FACT, IN HIS LAST HBO SPECIAL, TAPED IN MARCH 2008, GEORGE RANTED ABOUT OVERPROTECTIVE PARENTING: "YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? THESE BABY BOOMERS, THESE SOFT, FRUITY BABY BOOMERS, ARE RAISING AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF SOFT, FRUITY KIDS WHO AREN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO HAVE HAZARDOUS TOYS FOR CHRIST'S SAKES. HAZARDOUS TOYS, S - - T. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO NATURAL SELECTION, SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST? THE KID WHO SWALLOWS TOO MANY MARBLES DOESN'T GET TO GROW UP AND HAVE KIDS OF HIS OWN." THE AUDIENCE HOWLED AND KELLY SAYS SHE LAUGHED, TOO, THOUGH SHE WASN'T ALL THAT SURPRISED. "I SAT IN THE AUDIENCE LISTENING TO THIS GOING, 'WELL, OF COURSE THIS DISGUSTS HIM, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE WAS THE ULTIMATE LAISSEZ-FAIRE PARENT.' " THAT'S ONE WAY TO PUT IT. KELLY'S BOOK HAS HARROWING STORIES INVOLVING HER AS A LITTLE GIRL ALONE WITH HER MOM AND DAD WHILE BOTH OF THEM ARE WASTED ON DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. ONE SUCH STORY TOOK PLACE IN A HOTEL ROOM IN HAWAII WHEN KELLY WAS 11 YEARS OLD. SHE WRITES: "WE HAD SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY IN THE BAR IN LAHAINA SO MY DAD COULD SCORE SOME COKE AND WEED. ... THE COKE WAS RUNNING LOW, MOM WANTED MORE AND DAD WOULDN'T SHARE. THEY FOUGHT, THREATENED DIVORCE, AND ARGUED ABOUT EVERY TRESPASS THEY'D EVER COMMITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THEIR 14 YEARS TOGETHER. THEN MOM PICKED UP A KITCHEN KNIFE, AND DAD DID, TOO. "I SCREAMED AND HURLED MYSELF BETWEEN THEM. " 'STOP! STOP! PLEASE JUST STOP THIS.' " THEY DID STOP, AND LITTLE KELLY BECAME THE ADULT: "I WROTE OUT A UN-STYLE PEACE TREATY THAT STATED, 'I, GEORGE CARLIN/BRENDA CARLIN, WILL NO LONGER BUY OR SNORT COCAINE, DRINK ALCOHOL, OR ARGUE WITH EACH OTHER FOR THE REST OF THE VACATION. THE UNDERSIGNED AGREES TO THESE CONDITIONS SO THAT WE CAN ALL HAVE A PERFECT HAWAIIAN VACATION.' I EVEN DREW THOSE LITTLE LINES WITH THEIR NAMES UNDERNEATH, AND THEY BOTH SIGNED IT." SADLY, BOTH PARENTS BROKE IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. KELLY WRITES THAT THEY RESUMED THEIR HABITS THE SAME DAY: MATEUS ROS FOR BRENDA; COCAINE FOR GEORGE. "I SPENT THE REST OF THE VACATION AS FAR AWAY FROM THEM AS I COULD," SHE WRITES, AND "PRETENDED" TO EVERYONE SHE MET THAT SHE WAS HAVING "THE PERFECT HAWAIIAN VACATION." VERY EARLY ON, KELLY SAYS SHE BECAME AN EXPERT AT FIGURING OUT WHAT DRUGS HER PARENTS WERE ON. "I COULD TELL. WAS MOM DRUNK? WAS SHE JUST WAKING UP AND HAD A HANGOVER? HAD DAD BEEN UP FOR A FEW DAYS WITH COCAINE, OR WAS HE JUST SMOKING SOME WEED AND HE'S JUST, YOU KNOW, KIND OF MELLOW? HAVE THEY BEEN ARGUING, ARE THEY GETTING ALONG? WALKING ON EGGSHELLS DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN TO EXPLAIN IT." MEANTIME, IN THE 1970S, GEORGE CARLIN'S CAREER WAS SOARING. HE PACKED SHOWS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES; HIS COMEDY ALBUMS WERE BEST-SELLERS; HE WAS A REGULAR ON TV VARIETY SHOWS HOSTED BY FLIP WILSON AND TONY ORLANDO ; AND HE WAS STIRRING UP TROUBLE AND MAKING HISTORY WITH "SEVEN DIRTY WORDS." IN 1975, GEORGE BECAME THE VERY FIRST HOST OF A NEW SHOW CALLED SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE . STONED OR NOT, GEORGE CARLIN WAS ALSO A PERFECTIONIST. ACCORDING TO JERRY HAMZA, GEORGE'S MANAGER AND BEST FRIEND FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS, THE COMIC WORKED AT HIS CRAFT INCESSANTLY. HE SAYS, "I WOULD TELL PEOPLE, 'WELL, WHERE'S GEORGE? HE'S UP IN THE TREES,' BECAUSE WHAT HE WANTED TO DO WAS WRITE. HE WANTED TO GO AWAY, BE BY HIMSELF AND WRITE." WHEN GEORGE WASN'T WRITING, HE AND HAMZA WERE ON THE ROAD DRIVING TO GIGS, TV TAPINGS AND MEETINGS WITH ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY TYPES. "I SPENT MORE TIME WITH HIM THAN HIS WIFE OR HIS DAUGHTER," HAMZA SAYS. LONG ABSENCES AND DRUGS ASIDE, A CARLIN HOME COMPANION ALSO INCLUDES MOMENTS OF GEORGE CARLIN AS A PRETTY COOL AND CARING DAD. KELLY SAYS WATCHING TV TOGETHER THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW , WILD KINGDOM WAS A RIOT. "ESPECIALLY THE FUN ANIMAL SHOWS BECAUSE HE WOULD DO ALL THE VOICES AND IT WAS WAY MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THE ACTUAL SHOW," SHE SAYS. MUSIC WAS A HUGE PASSION GEORGE SHARED WITH HIS DAUGHTER, WHETHER IT WAS PUTTING HIS HEADPHONES ON HER SO SHE COULD LISTEN TO A NEW PIECE CALLED TUBULAR BELLS OR PLAYING THE BEATLES' WHITE ALBUM AROUND THE HOUSE. KELLY SAYS THE FIRST SONG SHE EVER LEARNED TO SING WAS THE BEATLES' "THE CONTINUING STORY OF BUNGALOW BILL." "THERE WERE KIDS IN IT, YOU KNOW, 'ALL THE CHILDREN SING.' YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER SKIPPING AROUND THE HOUSE, SINGING THE WORDS AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS 'HEY, BUNGALOW BILL, WHO DID YOU KILL?' [HAVING] NO IDEA WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT." KELLY STILL HAS HER FATHER'S IPOD WITH SOME 20,000 SONGS ON IT BLUES, FOLK, JAZZ AND ROCK. "HE WAS ALWAYS DISCOVERING NEW MUSIC." AT ITS CORE, A CARLIN HOME COMPANION IS ABOUT THE PERKS AND PITFALLS OF BEING THE DAUGHTER OF A FAMOUS, EDGY COMEDIAN IN THE 1960S AND '70S. KELLY WRITES ABOUT NEW CARS, CARIBBEAN VACATIONS AND A NIGHT OF PARTYING WITH LEIF GARRETT AND GRIFFIN O'NEAL THAT, AMUSINGLY, ENDS UP A SLEEPOVER AT THE HOME OF GRIFFIN'S PARENTS, FARRAH FAWCETT AND RYAN O'NEAL. AT THE SAME TIME, KELLY STRUGGLED WELL INTO ADULTHOOD TO OVERCOME THE FEAR THAT COMES WITH BEING RAISED BY ADDICTS. "THIS BOOK HAS ALWAYS FELT LIKE UNFINISHED BUSINESS," SHE SAYS. "I WANTED TO TELL MY SURVIVOR'S TALE OF HOW I FOUND MY WAY THROUGH THE CHAOS." WHEN GEORGE CARLIN DIED IN 2008, KELLY SAYS THE OUTPOURING FROM HER DAD'S FANS WAS OVERWHELMING. COMEDIANS WHO WORSHIPPED HIM SHARED THEIR GRIEF WITH HER GARY SHANDLING, RICHARD BELZER, LEWIS BLACK AND JON STEWART AMONG THEM. SHE WRITES: "MY FATHER WAS GONE. BUT I WAS NOT ALONE. I DIDN'T HAVE TO FEAR FALLING DOWN A RABBIT HOLE OF GRIEF BECAUSE THESE MEN WERE STRETCHING OUT THEIR HEARTS AND DECLARING, WE ARE HERE FOR YOU. I REALIZED THAT THESE MEN WERE, IN SOME WAYS, MY FATHER'S OTHER CHILDREN. HE HAD INSPIRED, SHAPED, AND DETERMINED THEIR LIVES AS MUCH AS HE HAD SHAPED MINE. THEY, TOO, WERE HIS HEIRS. I FELT AN INSTANT KINSHIP WITH THEM. THEY WERE MY BROTHERS AND UNCLES. I FELT A NET OF LOVE CATCH ME AND CARRY ME FORWARD." TODAY KELLY HOSTS A RADIO SHOW ON SIRIUS XM, AND SHE AND GEORGE'S LONGTIME FRIEND JERRY HAMZA ARE VERY MUCH THE KEEPERS OF HIS LEGACY. SHE ALSO INHERITED A WICKED SENSE OF HUMOR.

917	12TH SEPTEMBER 2015 IF WE DID ALL THE THINGS WE WERE CAPABLE OF DOING, WE WOULD LITERALLY ASTONISH OURSELVES WELL THANK YOU RAIN, BEEN AWAKE SINCE EXACTLY 3.33AM, GOOD JOB I WENT TO BED EARLY OR I'D BE REALLY TIRED RIGHT NOW, INSTEAD I'M GOOD AND RARING TO GO. I HAD THE BEST DAY YESTERDAY TOO WHICH HELPS. HAD SOME MUCH ENJOYED ME TIME, AS MY BESTIE COULDN'T MAKE IT, I WAS GONNA DO THE HOUSEWORK THEN I THOUGHT NOPE, IT'S SUNNY, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN AND I FANCY ME A WALK AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I HAD. A COUPLE OF HOURS, ENJOYING THE SCENERY AND THE PEACE AND QUIET ON CANNOCK CHASE, NO 3G SIGNAL ON MY PHONE SO COMPLETE DISCONNECTEDNESS. I DO LOVE THE CHASE AND THE HEATHER LOOKS STUNNING AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, PLUS IT HELPED ME EARN 7 ACTIVITY PROPOINTS, BONUS! I THEN HAD ME AN HOUR ROUND THE SHOPS BEFORE GOING FOR MY MASSAGE, FINISHED MY DAY OFF BY COOKING MYSELF A DELICIOUS TEA, STEAK AND SPAGHETTI, IT WORKS AND WAS DELICIOUS. I WAS GOING TO GARDEN TODAY BUT WITH THE RAIN THAT'S GOING ON AT THE MOMENT, I DON'T THINK I WILL BE, INSTEAD I'LL SPEND SOME TIME IN THE KITCHEN I THINK POSSIBLY OR CHILLING WITH MY MOM, WHO KNOWS I MAY CONSIDER THE HOUSEWORK, I KEEP PUTTING THAT OFF. WHAT'S STOPPING ME? PROCRASTINATION IF I'M HONEST, PLAN OLD PUTTING IT OFF, I JUST FIND IT A LITTLE TEDIOUS, ACTUALLY A BIT OVERWHELMING, I KNOW IT'S A BIG JOB AND IT'S JUST GETTING STARTED THAT SUCKS, ONCE I'M INTO IT, I ACTUALLY START TO ENJOY IT AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE RESULTS. MMM AM I TALKING ABOUT MY HOUSEWORK THERE OR HOW SO MANY OF US FEEL ABOUT SORTING OUR EATING HABITS OUT AND TACKLING OUR WEIGHT! SO LET'S CHANGE THIS NOW TO WEIGHT, BECAUSE I'D BE AVOIDING THE ISSUE IF I PRETENDED PEOPLE DON'T DISAPPEAR FROM MEETINGS IN THE SUMMER, THEY DO. WE'RE MORE SIMILAR THAN WE CARE TO ADMIT, THEN ONCE THE KIDS GO BACK TO SCHOOL OR WE'VE HAD OUR HOLIDAYS WE PUT OFF RETURNING TO OUR MEETING, THEN WE REALISE CHRISTMAS IS ON THE WAY AND WE FINALLY GET BACK ON IT. SO WHAT'S STOPPING YOU? BECAUSE LET'S BE HONEST, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT TO MAKE HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHANGES AND IT'S ALL TOO EASY TO PUT IT OFF. HERE'S A THOUGHT, BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE PUTTING IT OFF IS JUST DOWN TO LACK OF MOTIVATION OR LAZINESS, DID YOU KNOW THAT PROCRASTINATION CAN SOMETIMES BE A SIGN OF LOW SELF-ESTEEM! YOU'RE DELAYING STARTING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SUBCONSCIOUS FEAR THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO FAIL, IS THAT WHAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK? WELL GO TELL YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS TO DO ONE BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO SUCCEED, MAKE REALISTIC CHANGES AND TWEAKS, GET YOURSELF THE SUPPORT YOU NEED AND YOU WILL DO THIS. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE HOUSEWORK, BEFORE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE SUCH HARD WORK AND UNENJOYABLE, WELL WE CAN FEEL LIKE THAT ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS, BUT ONCE WE SEE THOSE RESULTS AND REALISE WE CAN HAVE FUN, EAT DELICIOUS FOOD AND STILL LOSE WEIGHT, WE WONDER WHY WE EVER PUT OFF STARTING. BREAK IT DOWN, SET YOURSELF SMALL GOALS, YES WE ALL HAVE AN OVERALL TARGET, BUT BY SETTING MINI WEIGHT LOSS GOALS, IT'LL KEEP YOU GOING WEEK BY WEEK. THEN THERE'S THE PLATEAU, WE ALL HIT THEM, ONCE THE HONEYMOON PERIOD OF WEIGHT LOSS JOURNEY WEARS OFF, YOU KNOW THAT FIRST FEW WEEKS OF WOO HOO GREAT WEIGHT LOSS, ONCVE IT SLOWS DOWN AND PEOPLE STOP NOTICING, WE CAN START TO FORGET WHY WE STARTED, THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO SIT DOWN AND MAKE A LIST OF WHY YOU STARTED, WHAT'S IMPROVED IN YOUR LIFE SINCE YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT AND HOW IT'S GOING TO CARRY ON GETTING BETTER. AND DON'T GIVE ME THE "I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT THIS WEEK" LINE, I USE THAT TOO OFTEN MYSELF. I KNOW MOST OF THE TIME WE HAVE A TO DO LIST LONGER THAN OUR ARM, AND THE THOUGHT OF ADDING TO IT MAKES US SHUDDER. BUT REALLY ISN'T PRIORITISING OUR WELLBEING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD, BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DO THAT, ONE DAY WE'LL GET SICK AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. ROUTINE HELPS HERE, GET INTO THE HABIT OF SPENDING 15 MINUTES PLANNING YOUR MEALS FOR THE WEEK, OR ALLOCATE 20 MINUTES A DAY TO HAVING A WALK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE TO DO WALKING SO IT'S THE QUICKEST AND EASIEST ACTIVITY, JUST POP ON YOUR TRAINERS AND WALK FROM WHERE YOU ARE. COOKING FROM SCRATCH DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TIME CONSUMING, MY TEA TOOK 15 MINUTES YESTERDAY AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE THE SPAGHETTI TAKES 11 MINUTES TO COOK AS I USED FROZEN VEGETABLES FOR QUICKNESS SO NO CHOPPING. SO COME ON NO MORE EXCUSES, ACKNOWLEDGE YOU'RE PUTTING IT OFF AND HONESTLY ANSWER THE QUESTION "WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?" THEN REALISE IT'S AN EXCUSE AND GET STARTED, IF YOU'RE ALREADY DOING IT, GO YOU! I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING MY BEYOUTIFUL MEMBERS THIS MORNING, THEY'RE DOING IT, THEY REALISE IT WORKS AND THEY'RE ENJOYING THE JOURNEY. HERE'S TO A GREAT WEEKEND - YOU IN? AND YES I AM GOING TO TACKLE THE HOUSEWORK, I'VE TALKED MYSELF ROUND!
918	ROBEY JENKINS, HR MANAGER FOR AGE UK GLOUCESTERSHIRE SHARES HIS WEEKLY BLOG WITH US: MUCH LIKE THE NAMING OF CATS, THE ADVERTISING OF A JOB IS A CURIOUS MATTER. LAST WEEK I MADE AN ARGUMENT THAT JOB ADVERTISERS SHOULD TAKE A MORE PRACTICAL APPROACH TO THE PAPER QUALIFICATIONS THEY EXPECT FROM CANDIDATES. AND IT OCCURRED TO ME AS I WROTE THAT, PERHAPS, I SHOULD TAKE SOME TIME TO WRITE MORE GENERALLY ABOUT THE ADVERTISING OF JOBS. IT IS A TASK OFTEN DELEGATED TO JUNIOR HR OPERATORS, RECRUITING MANAGERS OR SOMEONE IN THE RECRUITING MANAGERS TEAM. IT OFTEN INVOLVES DIGGING OUT WHATEVER COPY WAS USED LAST TIME TO ADVERTISE THE ROLE AND RECYCLING IT. SO LET ME START BY SAYING THAT IF YOU, THE HR LEAD IN YOUR ORGANIZATION, ARENT PERSONALLY REVIEWING THE COPY OF EVERY SINGLE JOB AD YOU RELEASE, THEN EITHER YOU ALREADY HAVE A SPECIALIST RECRUITMENT LEAD (IN WHICH CASE, GO WRITE YOUR OWN BLOG AND STOP LOOKING TO ME FOR ADVICE) OR YOURE DOING IT WRONG. JOB ADVERTS SHOULD BE TREATED AS TOPICS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE BY THE HR LEAD, EVEN IF THEY ARE DELEGATING THE SPECIFICS TO A TRAINED SUBORDINATE, FOR TWO KEY REASONS: THE QUALITY OF YOUR JOB ADS WILL DICTATE THE QUALITY OF YOUR APPLICANTS . A REALLY POWERFUL AND EFFECTIVE JOB AD CONVEYS A POSITIVE IMPRESSION OF THE ROLE AND THE ORGANIZATION AND SO WILL DRAW MORE APPLICANTS. AS THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS INCREASES, THE OVERALL QUALITY OF YOUR SHORT-LIST WILL RISE. YOUR JOB ADS ARE ALSO AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR YOUR WHOLE ORGANIZATION . IT ISNT OFTEN THAT HR GETS TO WRITE ADVERTISING COPY WITHOUT MARKETING GETTING INVOLVED. IN FACT, IF YOU HAVE A MARKETING & COMMUNICATIONS TEAM, THEN THEY PROBABLY SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN HELPING TO FRAME YOUR JOB AD. BUT WHETHER THEY ARE INVOLVED OR NOT, A JOB AD IS A MARKETING TOOL AND A PRESS RELEASE. AND ITS NOT JUST ONE AIMED AT PEOPLE OUTSIDE YOUR ORGANIZATION. YES, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, YOUR JOB ADS WILL BE READ BY PEOPLE WHO ALREADY WORK FOR YOU. IT WILL BE READ WITH PARTICULAR INTEREST BY THOSE ALREADY DOING THE SAME OR A SIMILAR JOB TO THE ONE YOURE ADVERTISING FOR AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE THINKING OF APPLYING! THEY WANT TO SEE WHETHER WHAT YOURE ADVERTISING AND WHAT THEY DO EVERY DAY BEAR ANY RESEMBLANCE TO EACH OTHER. SO WITH THOSE TWO KEY POINTS MADE, LETS TAKE A PRACTICAL LOOK AT WHAT TO INCLUDE IN A JOB ADVERT AND HOW TO LAY IT OUT. IT WOULD BE TEMPTING, AT THIS POINT, TO START WITH THE BOX TICKING: WHAT YOU MUST INCLUDE AND WHAT YOU MUST NOT. BUT IM GOING TO DELIBERATELY LEAVE THAT TO THE END. IF I COULD, ID LEAVE IT OUT ENTIRELY, BUT I FEEL COMPELLED TO MENTION IT, IF ONLY TO SALVE MY CONSCIENCE. INSTEAD, WE WILL START WITH WHATS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT: SELL THE COMPANY A JOB AD IS AN ADVERT, WHICH MEANS IT IS AN EXERCISE IN SELLING. AND THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD BE SELLING IS THE ORGANIZATION. THIS SETS THE CONTEXT FOR THE JOB. A JOB HITTING STUFF OR MOVING PAPER OR WRITING CODE ISNT, INHERENTLY, ALL THAT EXCITING. BUT ITS A COG IN A MACHINE THAT DOES SOMETHING GREAT! AT LEAST, IT OUGHT TO BE, ESPECIALLY IF YOURE IN A CHARITY. THE ORGANIZATION DOES SOMETHING BIG AND EXCITING AND CLEVER AND IMPORTANT AND YOU, THE APPLICANT, ARE GOING TO HAVE A PART IN THAT! THE AD SHOULD MAKE THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATE FEEL EXCITED ABOUT WORKING FOR YOU BEFORE THEYVE EVEN READ THE JOB DESCRIPTION. SELL THE JOB TOO MANY JOB ADS FOCUS ON WHAT THE JOB INVOLVES. AND UNLESS THE JOB IN QUESTION INVOLVES (A) CUDDLING BABY ANIMALS, (B) SPACE TRAVEL OR (C) FREE LUXURY HOLIDAYS, THE ACTUAL DAY-TO-DAY WORK THAT THE JOB INVOLVES ISNT GOING TO ATTRACT ANYONE. IF YOU WANT TO SELL THE JOB, SELL ITS IMPACT . YOUVE ALREADY EXPLAINED WHY WHAT THE COMPANY DOES IS AMAZING, IMPORTANT AND EXCEPTIONAL. SO NOW YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY WHAT THIS JOB DOES IS VITAL TO THE AMAZING IMPORTANCE OF THAT EXCEPTIONALITY. CANDIDATES WILL PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW WHETHER THE JOB INVOLVES HITTING THINGS OR MOVING PAPER OR WRITING CODE. WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW IS THAT DOING THESE THINGS MATTERS AND THAT THEIR WORK WILL HAVE AN IMPACT AND ESPECIALLY (BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY) IN A CHARITABLE CONTEXT HOW THEM DOING THIS JOB WILL MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. INCIDENTALLY, IF YOU CANT DRAW A CLEAR LINE BETWEEN WHAT THE COMPANY DOES AND HOW THIS JOB CONTRIBUTES TO WHAT THIS COMPANY DOES THEN STOP WRITING THIS JOB AD AND GO BACK TO FIND OUT WHETHER YOU NEED THE JOB AT ALL. BUY THE CANDIDATE THERE ARE SOME THINGS, AS I SUGGESTED AT THE START, THAT YOU MUST INCLUDE. THE JOB TITLE, THE SALARY, THE HOURS AND THE LOCATION ARE THE KEY FOUR THINGS YOU NEED TO INCLUDE. IF SPACE ALLOWS, FEEL FREE TO INCLUDE A ROUGH OUTLINE OF THE OTHER BENEFITS, BUT DO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ACTUAL BENEFITS AND NOT JUST A LEGAL RIGHTS DRESSED IN SHINY CLOTHES. FLEXIBLE WORKING, PAID PARENTAL LEAVE AND A PENSION ARE ALL, TO SOME EXTENT, RIGHTS. IF YOU ENHANCE THESE, THOUGH, SAY SO. ALSO, UP TO THIS POINT, YOUVE BEEN IN SELL MODE. THE READER IS NOW POISED TO MOVE FROM CURIOUS TO CANDIDATE. BUT YOU CANT JUST LET ANYONE THROUGH THE DOOR. THEY WANT THE JOB. THEY NEED THE JOB. BUT DO THEY HAVE WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM THE JOB? OF COURSE, YOULL BE SHORT-LISTING AND INTERVIEWING TO PICK THE PERFECT CANDIDATE. BUT YOU CAN MAKE THEM DO PART OF THE WORK FOR YOU BY SETTING OUT A FEW FILTER REQUIREMENTS IN THE ADVERT. THESE ARE THE HEADLINE BASICS THAT A CANDIDATE MUST HAVE TO GET FOOT IN THE DOOR. THINK IN TERMS OF ABSOLUTES: STRAIGHTFORWARD YES OR NO CRITERIA THAT FALL INTO ONE OF THREE CATEGORIES: QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERIENCE AND RESOURCES (FOR EXAMPLE, NEEDING A DRIVERS LICENCE OR ACCESS TO A CAR FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES). THESE SHOULD FILTER OUT ANYONE WHO CANT SAY YES TO EVERYTHING, SO EVERYONE WHO MOVES ON TO THE APPLY NOW STAGE SHOULD ALREADY MEET YOUR BASIC NEEDS. AS FOR THINGS YOU SHOULD NOT INCLUDE, KEEP IN MIND THE PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS IN THE EQUALITIES ACT 2010. ANYTHING IN THE AD STRAYING INTO THAT TERRITORY WITHOUT A VERY CLEAR, OPERATIONAL JUSTIFICATION: REMOVE. THE NAMING OF CATS NOT ONLY IS THE NAMING OF CATS A CURIOUS MATTER, ACCORDING TO OLD POSSUM, BUT IT ALSO INVOLVES THREE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT PARTS. AND SO, WE SEE, DOES THE ADVERTISING OF JOBS, ALTHOUGH IT DOESNT SCAN SO WELL. THE GOOD NEWS, THOUGH, IS THAT NO PART OF THE ADVERTISING OF JOBS IS EFFANINEFFABLE OR DEEP AND INSCRUTABLE. JOBS ARE PRODUCTS. CANDIDATES ARE CURRENCY. IF WE WANT THE RIGHT CANDIDATES IN THE RIGHT JOBS, THEN WE HAVE TO SELL THE COMPANY, SELL THE JOB, AND BUY THE CANDIDATE.

919	BRADLEY A.  HERE IS THE ABSTRACT: COURTS HAVE INTERPRETED THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA) AND THE PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION ACT (PDA) NOT TO AFFIRMATIVELY REQUIRE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PREGNANT WORKERS. THIS HAS GENERATED PROTEST AND LED ALL THREE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PREGNANCY RIGHTS. THE PREGNANT WORKERS FAIRNESS ACT IS PENDING IN CONGRESS AND HAS DRAWN STRONG VOCAL SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT RECENTLY DECIDED YOUNG V.  THE APPEAL OF THE DEAL IS LESS IMMEDIATELY CLEAR FOR DELL, WHICH HASN'T PREVIOUSLY SOLD COMPETING THIRD-PARTY COMPUTERS AND WHICH HAS DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE TABLETS OF ITS OWN, SUCH AS THE VENUE PRO AND THE LATITUDE 2-IN-1. UPS, WHICH FOUND THE PDA DOES NOT AFFIRMATIVELY REQUIRE PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS. FINALLY, MANY COMMENTATORS HAVE ARGUED IN SUPPORT OF CONSIDERING PREGNANCY A DISABILITY UNDER THE ADA.  19. THIS ARTICLE AGREES SUBSTANTIVELY WITH THE END OF ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY, BUT DISAGREES WITH THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS COMMENTATORS HAVE ADVANCED. IN CONTRAST TO THOSE WHO FAVOR A PREGNANCY-SPECIFIC RIGHT TO ACCOMMODATIONS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH PROPOSALS CREATE RISKS TO WOMENS LONG-TERM EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE.  LUKAS C. IN PARTICULAR, CHARACTERIZING PREGNANCY AS A DISABILITY OR PREGNANT WOMEN AS A CLASS IN SPECIAL NEED OF ACCOMMODATION POSES A DANGER OF EXPRESSIVE HARMS. CURRENTLY PROPOSED MEASURES MAY REVITALIZE EXCLUSIONARY AND PATERNALISTIC ATTITUDES TOWARD PREGNANT EMPLOYEES, SIGNAL INCAPACITY TO WORK, OR ACTUALLY INCREASE SEX DISCRIMINATION.  UNPACK KEY WORDS, PHRASES, AND CONCEPTS. WE SHOULD THUS CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EXPRESSIVE IMPACT OF PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATION SCHEMES IN LIGHT OF CURRENT SOCIAL NORMS IN WHICH PREGNANT WOMEN ARE GENERALLY SEEN AS CAPABLE OF PRODUCTIVE WORK. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO SECURING PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS THAT WOULD AVOID EXPRESSIVE HARMS AND EMPLOY A GENDER SYMMETRICAL APPROACH. THIS ARTICLES CRITIQUE AND THE QUESTION OF HOW BEST TO ACCOMMODATE PREGNANCY RESONATE ACROSS SEVERAL AREAS OF THE LAW. FOR THOSE WHO STUDY CIVIL RIGHTS, ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY ILLUSTRATES THE EXPRESSIVE PERILS OF RIGHTS CLAIMING.  I AM GOING FIRST TO ENJOY OUR VICTORY AND THEN OBVIOUSLY I WILL HAVE TO CORRECT A FEW THINGS." DESCHAMPS MAY HAVE REMOVED THE ARSENAL STAR EARLY IN THE SECOND HALF BUT HE WAS SWIFT TO DEFEND THE EFFORTS OF HIS STRIKER. FOR HISTORIANS AND SCHOLARS INTERESTED IN GENDER ISSUES, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A CHANCE TO RECONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF GENDER-ASYMMETRICAL LAWS. FOR FAMILY LAW SCHOLARS, ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY HIGHLIGHTS THE CURRENT CAPACITY OF THE LAW TO RESHAPE WORK/FAMILY BALANCE.  MR LEACH SAID THE DELAY WAS UNREASONABLE AND MORE THAN THE 180-DAY PERIOD PRESCRIBED IN THE PROMOTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE ACT. TO ASSUME THAT IMPLEMENTING GENDER-ASYMMETRICAL RIGHTS IS THE BEST WAY TO HELP WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE OVERLOOKS THE POTENTIAL OF THE LAW TO AMELIORATE BROADER SOCIAL ISSUES. THESE INCLUDE THE WAY IN WHICH EMPLOYMENT IS TYPICALLY STRUCTURED TO ACCOMMODATE THE MOST PRIVILEGED EMPLOYEES AND HOW EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE ACCOMMODATING WORKPLACES.

922	THE BIG WOODS ON AVERILLS ISLAND IS THE SITE OF AN AUDUBON PRE-THANKSGIVING GUIDED WALK TO DISCOVER WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD OF NATURE AS PLANTS AND ANIMALS PREPARE FOR WINTER. FALL IS A GREAT TIME TO TAKE THE FAMILY TO AN AUDUBON SANCTUARY TO WITNESS BIRD MIGRATION AND EMBRACE THE CHANGING SEASON. SANCTUARIES ACROSS NEW ENGLAND GIVE FAMILIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THE NATURAL WORLD THROUGH OBSERVATIONS OF NOT ONLY BIRDS, BUT MAMMALS AS WELL. CREATURES HAVE A LOT TO DO TO PREPARE FOR WINTER AND EVEN WHEN THE SNOW FLIES, THERE ARE STILL SOME BIRDS AND ANIMALS AROUND TO TRACK. AUDUBON CENTERS SCHEDULE A VARIETY OF EVENTS, BUT YOU DONT NEED A SPECIFIC DATE AND TIME TO ENJOY THE GROUNDS. HIKING TRAILS FULL OF INTERESTING SITES INCLUDING THE WONDERFUL FALL COLORS ARE OPEN WHENEVER YOUR BUSY FAMILY HAS TIME TO SWING BY, FROM DAWN TO DUSK. YOU CAN SEE A LOT IN AUDUBON SANCTUARIES FROM MAINE TO MASSACHUSETTS THIS FALL; BUT FIRST, LETS TALK ABOUT THE BIRDS. WARBLERS ARE MOVING RIGHT NOW, SAYS DOUG HITCHCOX, STAFF NATURALIST AT GILSLAND FARM AUDUBON IN FALMOUTH. FROM MID- TO LATE-SEPTEMBER WARBLERS ARE PEAKING, BUT SPARROWS TEND TO MOVE A BIT LATER. IF YOU HOPE TO SEE COLORFUL BIRDS AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT BE A TAD DISAPPOINTED. SOME ARE MOLTING AND THE FEATHERS MIGHT BE A BIT DULL RIGHT NOW. BUT AS THE LEAVES FALL, THE BIRDS CAN BE SEEN MORE EASILY ON THEIR PERCHES IN THE TREES. ITS A BIT OF GIVE-AND-TAKE FOR BIRDING FANS. NORTHERN HARRIER AT THE IPSWICH RIVER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IN TOPSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, THE WATERFOWL MIGRATION IS IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE OF ITS SHEER NUMBERS. THE BEST PLACE TO WATCH THE WONDERFUL NATURAL SPECTACLE IS ALONG THE BUNKERS MEADOW TRAIL. CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE OBSERVATION TOWER TO REALLY TAKE IN THE MEADOW, SAYS SCOTT SANTINO, IPSWICH RIVER WILDLIFE SANCTUARY NATURALIST. THE BEST TIME TO SEE THEM IS AT DAWN WHEN THEY LEAVE THE MEADOW AND AT DUSK WHEN THEY FLY INTO IT. BUT ITS NOT JUST ABOUT THE FALL MIGRATION, AS IMPRESSIVE AS IT CAN BE. ON THE STAFF NATURALIST-LED BIRD WALKS HOSTED EVERY THURSDAY AT 7 A.M. THROUGH NOVEMBER AT GILSLAND FARM, THERE ARE PLENTY OF MAMMALS THAT OFFER SOME FASCINATING ENTERTAINMENT AS WELL. HITCHCOX EXPLAINS, WE HAD A GREAT ENCOUNTER ON ONE OF THE WEEKLY BIRD WALKS RECENTLY. WE SAW A WEASEL DART ACROSS THE TRAIL AND A FEW MINUTES LATER WE SPOTTED A DEAD MEADOW MOUSE ON THE PATH. WE STOPPED TO LOOK AT IT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE WEASEL CAME RUNNING RIGHT UP TO US AND SNATCHED THE MOUSE AND RAN OFF WITH IT. THE FUN THING ABOUT WALKING THESE TRAILS REGULARLY IS THAT THERE IS ALWAYS SOME SURPRISE. AT MOST AUDUBON CENTERS AND SANCTUARIES THERE ARE 8 IN MAINE AND MANY MORE ALL OVER NEW ENGLAND THERE ARE NATURALISTS AND TRAINED DOCENTS AVAILABLE TO HELP VISITORS IDENTIFY BIRDS AND WILDLIFE. ON SUNDAYS, THERE ARE VOLUNTEER DOCENTS AT IPSWICH RIVER THAT LEAD TOURS ON A DROP-IN BASIS. A BIG THRILL FOR KIDS AND ADULTS AT THIS PARTICULAR SANCTUARY IS THE FRIENDLINESS OF THE BIRDS: THEY ARE KNOWN TO LAND ON A VISITORS HAND TO NIBBLE SEEDS. BUT BE WARNED, THE CENTER DOESNT SELL SEEDS, SO BE SURE TO BRING YOUR OWN. AT GILSLAND FARM, THE 2- TO 6-YEAR-OLD CROWD HAS A FEW OPPORTUNITIES THIS FALL TO VISIT THE CENTER IN THEIR PAJAMAS.

923	SARAH CRABILL/ ALMIROLA FINISHED FOURTH, MISSING THE PLAYOFFS BY 17 POINTS. WITH A PLAYOFF BID ON THE LINE, ARIC ALMIROLA KNEW WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO SATURDAY NIGHT AT RICHMOND INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY. LINED UP BEHIND LEADER MATT KENSETH ON A RESTART WITH 18 LAPS REMAINING, ALMIROLA PLANNED TO DIVE-BOMB KENSETH INTO TURN 1 AND MUSCLE AROUND. THAT STRATEGY WAS THWARTED WHEN KENSETH TOOK OFF ON THE RESTARTED AND QUICKLY BUILT UP AN INSURMOUNTABLE ADVANTAGE. ALMIROLA WOULD FINISH FOURTH AND MISSED THE CHASE FOR THE SPRINT CUP. HAD HE WON, ALMIROLA WOULD'VE AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFIED. "WE JUST CAME UP SHORT," ALMIROLA SAID. "I AM REALLY PROUD OF ALL MY GUYS. WE WORKED OUR GUTS OUT ALL YEAR LONG AND TONIGHT WAS NO DIFFERENT. I FEEL WE HAVE OVERACHIEVED THIS YEAR AND REALLY MAXIMIZED OUR RESULTS WEEK IN AND WEEK OUT. "I AM DISAPPOINTED TO COME UP A FEW SPOTS SHORT, BUT WE GAVE IT ALL WE HAD AND THAT IS ALL WE CAN DO." NONETHELESS, ON A FAIRLY ANTICLIMACTIC NIGHT -- KENSETH LED 352 OF 400 LAPS -- ALMIROLA PROVIDED SOME RARE MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT. HE FELL A LAP DOWN WITHIN THE FIRST 100 CIRCUITS, ONLY TO GET BACK ON THE LEAD LAP VIA THE "LUCK DOG" WHEN A LAP 113 MULTI-CAR ACCIDENT OCCURRED ON THE BACKSTRETCH. FROM THERE, ALMIROLA BEGIN A STEADY CHARGE TOWARDS THE FRONT. BUT BECAUSE PAUL MENARD FINISHED 26TH, ALMIROLA'S PUSH FOR A SECOND CONSECUTIVE CHASE BERTH FELL 17 POINTS SHY OF THE FINAL POSITION. JAMIE MCMURRAY, RYAN NEWMAN, JEFF GORDON AND CLINT BOWYER ALSO CLINCHED CHASE SPOTS. "IT IS TOUGH," ALMIROLA SAID. "THIS IS WHAT WE RACE FOR -- WE RACE TO WIN RACES. WE RACE TO RUN FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP. THIS RACE TEAM, WE GOT TO DO IT LAST YEAR AND WE HAD AN ENGINE FAILURE AT CHICAGO (THE PLAYOFF OPENER) AND FEEL LIKE WE HAD A LOT MORE TO SHOW IN THE CHASE LAST YEAR. WE WANTED ANOTHER SHOT AT IT REALLY BAD." ALMIROLA'S FOURTH-PLACE WAS HIS BEST RESULT OF THE SEASON, TOPPING A FIFTH IN MAY AT DOVER INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY SPEEDWAY. NOW OUT OF THE CHASE, THE RICHARD PETTY MOTORSPORTS DRIVER IS TURNING HIS FOCUS TO ENDING THE SEASON ON A HIGH NOTE. "WE WILL GO RACE THESE LAST 10 RACES AND TRY TO GET A VICTORY," ALMIROLA SAID. "WINNING IS GOOD NO MATTER WHEN IT IS, REGARDLESS OF THE CHASE OR NOT, WE WILL TRY TO GO STINK UP THE SHOW AND GET SOME WINS IN THE LAST 10 RACES."
924	UK SOLAR DEVELOPER HIVE ENERGY IS TO MAKE ITS FIRST BREAK INTO THE INTERNATIONAL SOLAR MARKET BY OPENING A NEW OFFICE IN DUBAI. ITS MIDDLE EAST REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS WILL BE LED BY THE COMPANYS MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND INDIAN OCEAN ISLAND DIRECTOR COLIN LOUBSER AND WILL TARGET POTENTIALLY LUCRATIVE SOLAR OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE REGION. SOLAR POWER IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE MOST OF THE COUNTRYS ELECTRICITY DEMAND. ALTHOUGH A MAJOR OIL PRODUCING COUNTRY, THE UAE IS TAKING SIGNIFICANT STEPS TOWARDS INTRODUCING SOLAR POWER ON A LARGE SCALE, SAID GILES REDPATH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT HIVE ENERGY. DUBAIS ELECTRICITY AND WATER AUTHORITY (DEWA) IS INCREASINGLY KEEN ON SOLAR AS A MEANS TO INCREASE RENEWABLES SHARE OF THE UAES ENERGY MIX BY TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, INCLUDING THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT OF THE 3GW MOHAMMED BIN RASHID AL MAKTOUM SOLAR PARK WHICH IS BEING OFFERED TO TENDER IN STAGES. THE UK GOVERNMENTS POLICY RESET THIS SUMMER PARTICULARLY PROPOSALS TO BRING A PREMATURE END TO RENEWABLES OBLIGATION SUPPORT FOR SUB-5MW SOLAR FARMS AND CUT THE FEED-IN TARIFF BY 87% HAVE CAUSED DEVELOPERS AND INSTALLERS IN THE COUNTRY ALIKE TO QUESTION THEIR PLACE IN THE MARKET AND INVESTIGATE OPPORTUNITIES OVERSEAS. ON TOP OF HIVES MOVE INTO THE UAE, NATIVE DEVELOPERS SUCH AS LIGHTSOURCE HAVE CONFIRMED MOVES INTO IRELANDS NASCENT PV MARKET WHILE A NUMBER OF FIRMS REMAIN INTERESTED IN INDIAS PLANS TO INSTALL UP TO 100GW OF SOLAR BY 2022. FINALY COLVILLE, HEAD OF INTELLIGENCE AT SOLAR INTELLIGENCE, SAID THAT THE DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE GAINED IN THE UK BY COMPANIES SUCH AS HIVE PLACED THEM IN A GOOD POSITION TO EXPORT IT GIVEN THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE UK MARKET. THE MODEL EMPLOYED BY IB VOGT, MARTIFER, AND OTHERS, OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, SHOWS THAT PROJECT DEVELOPMENT SKILLS CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER COUNTRIES. THE TRICK IS CHOOSING THE CORRECT COUNTRIES, AND ALIGNING WITH THE FINANCING VEHICLES SPECIFIC TO SOLAR AROUND THE WORLD. HAVING SUFFICIENT CORPORATE FINANCING BEHIND OVERSEAS EXPANSIONS HAS OFTEN BEEN THE KEY FACTOR BEHIND MANY DEVELOPERS ATTEMPTS TO HAVING A GLOBAL FOOTPRINT, AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING IN THIS RESPECT HOW HIVE ALIGNS ITS STRATEGY WITHIN THE MIDDLE EAST AND ANY OTHER COUNTRIES PRIORITISED FOR POST-UK GROWTH, COLVILLE ADDED.

THE MEETING TAKES PLACE AFTER A DECISION BY THE AUPSC ON 85 AUGUST REITERATING ITS SUPPORT FOR A PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING GATHERING ALL THE ARMED GROUPS AND POLITICAL PARTIES BUT THE RULING NATIONAL CONGRESS PARTY (NCP) REJECTS THIS ROADMAP.  P.S.  GOING FOR GOLD WEVE BEEN WORKING WITH A LOT OF SOCIAL PLATFORMS FOR A WHILE, SUCH AS FACEBOOK, TWITTER, AND PINTEREST, SAID ALLGROVE, AND ONE BIG OPPORTUNITY WE REALISED IS POWERING THE COMMERCE THROUGH THESE SOCIAL PLATFORMS RATHER THAN THE CURRENT EXPERIENCE, WHERE YOU ARE REDIRECTED AWAY TO A DIFFERENT PAGEWHICH OFTEN ISNT A GREAT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. SRF EXTERNAL RELATIONS SECRETARY, YASIR ARMAN,, WHO IS ALSO THE SPLM-N SECRETARY-GENERAL, TOLD SUDAN TRIBUNE THAT THE SRF URGED THE INTERNATIONAL ENVOYS TO BACK-THE RECENT DECISION OF UNION 549 IN SUPPORT OF A COMPRESSIVE AND INCLUSIVE NATIONAL DIALOGUE PROCESS IN SUDAN. ARMAN FURTHER REVEALED THAT THE ENVOYS HAVE AGREED TO BACK UP THE AUPSCS DECISION ON NATIONAL DIALOGUE.  MAGNET MAX IS A MODULAR SUITE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT PROVIDE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND BEST PRACTICES FOR ENTERPRISE GRADE MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT. HE ASSERTED THAT THE DECISION WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL WHICH WILL SUPPORT IT, PARTICULARLY SINCE THERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT ANY MATTER THAT WINS REGIONAL CONSENSUS SHOULD RECEIVE INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS AS WELL. THE SECOND MEETING WAS ATTENDED BY US ENVOY TO SUDAN AND SOUTH SUDAN DONALD BOOTH, BRITISH COUNTERPART, MATTHEW CANNELL IN ADDITION TO THE HEAD OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AT THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTRY JEAN-CHRISTOPHE BELLIARD. ALSO, PRESENT WERE A REPRESENTATIVE OF NORWAY AND THE EU ENVOY FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA ALEXANDER RONDOS. DURING THE MEETING, THE SRF GROUPS STRESSED THEIR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THE UNITY OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, WHICH BESIDES THE REBEL ALLIANCE, INCLUDE THE NATIONAL UMMA PARTY (NUP), NATIONAL CONSENSUS FORCES (NCF) AND CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS.  NO DEVELOPMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED AT TIMES OF WAR, HE SAID. THE MEETING WAS ADDRESSED VIA CONFERENCE CALL BY NUP LEADER AL-SADIG AL-MAHDI, NCF CHAIRMAN, FAROUK ABU ISSA, AMIN MAKKI MADANI, HEAD OF THE ALLIANCE OF THE SUDANESE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS AND GAHZI SALAH AL-DIN ATTABANI THE LEADER OF THE REFORM NOW MOVEMENT (RNM), A SPLINTER FACTION OF THE RULING PARTY. ARMAN SAID THE PARTICIPATION OF ATTABANI IN THE MEETING MARKS A PROGRESS IN THE RELATION BETWEEN THE RNM AND THE SRF. HE POINTED OUT THAT THE SRF GROUPS WILL HOLD A THREE-DAY MEETING IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL TO DISCUSS THE POLITICAL SITUATION, ADDING THE MEETING SHOULD COME OUT WITH A ROAD MAP FOR ALL ISSUES OF PEACE AND NATIONAL DIALOGUE IN SUDAN. HE SAID PREPARATIONS WERE UNDERWAY FOR A MEETING OF THE SUDAN CALL FORCES, BUT HE DID NOT GIVE A SPECIFIC DATE FOR THAT MEETING. ALSO, ARMAN REITERATED THAT SRF ARE COMMITTED TO THE UNITY OF THE OPPOSITION AND TO A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE SETTLEMENT, AWAY FROM PARTIAL SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE PROMISED THE SUDANESE PEOPLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE ROADMAP TO END WAR. THE BALL IS NOW IN KHARTOUMS COURT. IT IS THE PARTY THAT HAD INITIATED THESE WARS AND IT PERSISTENTLY REFUSED TO BRING THEM TO AN END, HE ADDED. LAST SUNDAY, THE DIALOGUE MECHANISM SOFTENED THIS POSITION ON THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING AND ANNOUNCED ACCEPTING TO MEET THE REBEL GROUPS BEFORE THE PROCESS TO DISCUSS THE GUARANTEES ENABLING THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DIALOGUE CONFERENCE IN KHARTOUM. IN PREVIOUS STATEMENTS, THE SPLM-N SECRETARY GENERAL HAD DISMISSED GOVERNMENT PRESS REPORTS THAT KHARTOUM WOULD NOT MIND ATTENDING A PRELIMINARY MEETING WITH SRF AND ARMED GROUPS AS AN ATTEMPT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO CAUSE A RIFT IN THE OPPOSITION FORCES, PARTICULARLY BETWEEN THE SRF AND THE NUP OF SADIQ AL-MAHDI. THE PRE-DIALOGUE MEETING S SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS THE CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD IMPLEMENT BEFORE THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO CREATE A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT. THESE INCLUDE A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND HUMANITARIAN ACCESS FOR CIVILIANS IN THE REBEL HELD AREAS, POLITICAL FREEDOMS AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. US PROPOSAL FOR STOPPING HOSTILITIES US BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT TO THE MEDIA, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED THAT THE REBELS SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT OMER AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. FOLLOWING THE JOINT MEETING, BOOTH MET WITH REBEL GROUPS FROM DARFUR REGION AND DISCUSSED THEIR DEMAND FOR RENEGOTIATING THE DOHA DOCUMENT FOR PEACE IN DARFUR. BOOTH DECLINED TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT, BUT SOURCES THAT TOOK PART IN THE MEETING SAID HE SUGGESTED TO THE REBEL GROUPS THAT THEY SHOULD ANNOUNCE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT A CEASEFIRE IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT AL-BASHIRS OFFER TO STOP MILITARY OPERATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS. SUDAN TRIBUNE LEARNT THAT BOOTH ALSO HELD A SEPARATE MEETING WITH THE SPLM-N TO DISCUSS NEGOTIATIONS WITH KHARTOUM ON A DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES DOCUMENT, INCLUDING A CEASEFIRE, AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO CIVILIANS IN THE SPLM-N CONTROLLED AREAS. ON ITS PART, SUDAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT - ABDEL WAHID AL-NUR ISSUED A STATEMENT REITERATING ITS DEMAND FOR PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS, DISARMING THE JANJAWEED AND THE REMOVAL OF NEW-COMERS FROM THE LANDS AND HAWAKEER. THE STATEMENT CLEARLY PROVIDED THAT THE GROUP WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE WITH KHARTOUM UNTIL THOSE "CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES" WERE MET.
927	WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW ACADEMIC YEAR, ALL STUDENTS FEEL THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE OF BUYING TEXTBOOKS. WITH A STEADY INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF TEXTBOOKS IN THE LAST TEN YEARS, MANY STUDENTS HAVE SOUGHT ALTERNATIVES TO PURCHASING TRADITIONAL TEXTBOOKS. STUDENTS SEE E-BOOKS OR RETAILERS SUCH AS AMAZON AS CHEAPER ALTERNATIVES TO PURCHASING BOOKS IN OVERPRICED CAMPUS BOOKSTORES. AS STUDENTS TAKE THEIR MONEY ELSEWHERE, BOOKSTORES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES BEGIN TO FEEL THE STRAIN. INDEPENDENTLY OWNED BOOKSTORES TAKE THE WORST HIT. IN FACT, THE BOOKSTORE AT WHITMAN COLLEGE IS ONE OF THE ONLY INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORES REMAINING IN WASHINGTON. THIS TREND AWAY FROM COLLEGE BOOKSTORES BELIES SOME MORE SERIOUS ISSUES THAN SIMPLE TEXTBOOK INFLATION. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS, TEXTBOOK PRICES HAVE RISEN 86 PERCENT, AND CONTINUE TO INCREASE BY ABOUT 6 PERCENT EACHYEAR. FOR REFERENCE, THE AVERAGE RATE OF INFLATION IN AMERICA IS CURRENTLY 2 PERCENT PER YEAR. SO WHY ARE TEXTBOOKS OUTSTRIPPING THE REST OF THE ECONOMY BY 300 PERCENT? PRIVATELY OWNED BOOKSTORES HAVE ALMOST NO CONTROL OVER THE PRICES OF THE BOOKS THEY SELL. IN REALITY THOSE PRICES ARE SET BY THE PUBLISHERS. WHITMAN BUYS MOST OF ITS NEW TEXTBOOKS FROM THE PUBLISHING COMPANY PEARSON, AS DO MOST COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE UNITED STATES. PEARSON OWNS SEVERAL OTHER SMALLER PUBLISHING COMPANIES, IN ADDITION TO MOST OF THE MAJOR EDUCATION CONSULTANTS (SUCH AS THE SAT, AND TEACHERS LICENSING ASSESSMENTS) IN AMERICA. THIS MONOPOLISTIC HOLD ON THE TEXTBOOKS IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DICTATE WHICH BOOKS ARE SELECTED FOR USE, AND TO SET THE PRICES OF THOSE BOOKS. MEANWHILE, COLLEGE BOOKSTORES TRY TO MAINTAIN A HOLD ON A MARKET QUICKLY ESCAPING THEM. IN 2011, 22.6 PERCENT OF THE BOOKS PURCHASED IN AMERICA WERE BOUGHT VIA AMAZON.COM , AS AMAZON OFFERS A DISCOUNT OVER MANY OTHER RETAILERS. E-BOOKS ALSO CLAIM A SHARE OF THE BUSINESS FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS, BECAUSE E-BOOKS CAN COST 60 PERCENT LESS THAN THEIR PAPER EQUIVALENTS. CORRESPONDINGLY, THERE HAS BEEN A 12.2 PERCENT DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT COLLEGE BOOKSTORES SINCE 1997. THE NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS OF THE LOSS OF INDEPENDENTLY OWNED BOOKSTORES COULD BE GREATER THAN IMMEDIATELY APPARENT. BEING COMPETITIVE WITH ONLINE AND BIG BOX RETAILERS IS OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE, SAID JANICE KING, BOOK ACQUISITIONS SPECIALIST ATTHE WHITMAN COLLEGE BOOKSTORE. BOOKS ARE THE BIG THING KEEPING THE BOOKSTORE ALIVE. KING HANDLES MOST OF THE TEXTBOOK PURCHASES FOR THE WHITMAN BOOKSTORE. SHE AND TRACY OBERG, THE BOOKSTORES MERCHANDISE AND MARKETING SPECIALIST, WORK TOGETHER WITH THE PUBLISHERS, ADMINISTRATION AND STUDENTS SO AS TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL PARTIES. OBERGS JOB AS MANAGER INCLUDES REACHING OUT TO THE STUDENT COMMUNITY AT WHITMAN TO DETERMINE WHICH PRODUCTS THE STORE WILL CARRY. WE ARE ABLE TO PERSONALIZE THE STORE TO REFLECT THE CULTURE AND PRIORITIES OF THE WHITMAN COMMUNITY, SAID OBERG. OUR CUSTOMER IS THE STUDENT; THATS WHO WE CARE ABOUT. THIS LEVEL OF STUDENT INFLUENCE OVER THE STORES MERCHANDISE IS NOT COMMON ON MOST CAMPUSES. THE ADVANTAGES OF A PRIVATELY-OWNED BOOKSTORE CAN BE SEEN IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, FROM THE CLUB APPAREL SOLD IN THE STORE, TO THE LARGE QUANTITY OF CHOCOLATE ON THE SHELVES, TO THIS YEARS SUPPLY OF USED PHYSICS TEXTBOOKS. PRICES ARE SET BY PUBLISHERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. USED BOOKS [ARE] WHERE WE HAVE MORE CONTROL, SAID KING. THE TEXTBOOKS IN QUESTION WERE PURCHASED ONE AT A TIME, UNTIL THE STORE HAD ENOUGH COPIES RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED 40-50 PERCENT SAVINGS FOR STUDENTS WHO PURCHASED THAT BOOK. THE MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEESOF THE WHITMAN BOOKSTORE STRIVE TO OPERATE A STORE WHICH REFLECTS THE COMMUNITY, AND WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE STUDENTS WITH EVERYTHING THEY NEED. ADDITIONALLY, ALL PROFITS OF THE WHITMAN BOOKSTORE ARE RETURNED TO THE COLLEGE, FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY. THOUGH INDEPENDENTLY-OWNED BOOKSTORES ARE LESS SECURE THAN THOSE BACKED BY COMPANIES SUCH AS BARNES AND NOBLE, THEY ARE ABLE TO OFFER MANY SERVICES THAT THOSE LARGER COMPANIES SIMPLY CANNOT. THE DIFFERENCES ARE APPARENT IF ONE VENTURES INTO THE WALLA WALLA UNIVERSITY BOOKSTORE WHICH IS BACKED BY A LARGER FRANCHISE. THERE, THE LARGER COMPANY SETS THE STANDARDS FOR TEXTBOOK PRICES, OFTEN AT A MARK-UP EVEN FROM THE PUBLISHERS PRICES. LARGER COMPANIES ARE ALSO UNABLE TO OFFER MANY OF THE USED BOOK AND BUY-BACK DEALS OF PRIVATELY-OWNED STORES. LAST SEMESTER, STUDENTS AT WHITMAN RECEIVED A TOTAL OF 71,000 DOLLARS FROM THE BOOKSTORE FROM BUYBACKS ALONE. THE STORE ALSO RECENTLY INTRODUCED A LOYALTY PROGRAM CALLED THE WHITCOIN, WHICH WILL REWARD STUDENTS WITH INCREASING DISCOUNTS AS THEY SPEND MONEY AT THE SCHOOL STORE. IM ALWAYS OPEN TO CARRY WHAT STUDENTS WANT. IF I CAN GET A DEAL ON THE ITEM, I GET A DEAL, SAID OBERG. DESPITE THE WORK OF THE MANAGERS TO BENEFIT WHITMAN STUDENTS, THE STORE STILL FACES CRITICISM. HIGH PRICES ARE NOT MADE MORE AFFORDABLE BY THE OTHER BENEFITS TO THE WHITMAN COMMUNITY. THE PUBLISHING COMPANIES EARN IMMENSE PROFITS FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS; LAST YEAR, PEARSON TOOK IN A NET PROFIT OF 1.5 BILLION DOLLARS. WITH PROFITS OF THAT SIZE, THERE IS LITTLE INCENTIVE FOR PUBLISHERS TO REDUCE THEIR PRICES TO A MORE AFFORDABLE RATE. BECAUSE INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORES RELY UPON THE BUSINESS OF STUDENTS FOR THEIR SUCCESS, THEY CANNOT FALL BACK ON OTHER FRANCHISES FOR SUPPORT. WHILE THEIR GOALS ARE NOBLE AND THEIR EFFORTS PRODUCTIVE, THE FACT REMAINS THAT SOME STUDENTS CANNOT AFFORD THE BOOKS SOLD AT INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORES. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT STUDENTS WISH TO SUPPORT THE COLLEGE-OWNED STORE, IT IS NOT PRACTICAL FOR ALL OF THEM. THIS CREATES A PARADOX WITHIN THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY: TO PAY MORE FOR BOOKS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE OTHER ADVANTAGES THE BOOKSTORE PROVIDES THE COMMUNITY, OR TO SEEK A MORE FINANCIALLY EFFICIENT SOLUTION. MANY WHITMAN STUDENTS REFLECTED THAT THEIR OWN OPINIONS REGARDING THE WHITMAN BOOKSTORE WERE IRRELEVANT WHEN FACED WITH OTHER (FAR LESS EXPENSIVE) OPTIONS. FIRST-YEAR LUCY OSULLIVAN SUMS UP THIS PARADOX AND ECHOES THE VIEWS OF MANY OF HER PEERS, SAYING, ITS JUST TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE. ONE STUDENT AT WHITMAN WENT AS FAR AS TO PEN AN ANONYMOUS LETTER, VENTING HIS OR HER FRUSTRATION. ALTHOUGH THE LETTER DIRECTED BLAME AT THE BOOKSTORE, RATHER THAN THE PUBLISHERS, THE SENTIMENTS IT EXPRESSED WERE VALID CONCERNS. STUDENTS NEED TO USE THESE BOOKS, AND AS THEIR COST INCREASES STUDENTS FIND IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO AFFORD THEM. PUBLISHING COMPANIES HOLD A MONOPOLY WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO CHARGE ANY PRICE FOR TEXTBOOKS, PUTTING BOTH THE STUDENTS AND THE INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORES IN A STATE OF FINANCIAL DISTRESS.
928	DEAR CAPTAIN AWKWARD, LATELY IVE RUN INTO A STUPID ISSUE THAT I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET OVER. I HAVE TWO FRIENDS (LETS CALL THEM RAOUL AND CHRISTINE, FOR CONVENIENCES SAKE) THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND RECENTLY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP. IVE KNOWN CHRISTINE FOR ABOUT CLOSE TO TEN YEARS AND I CONSIDER HER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN THROUGH AN ALMOST-PURELY ONLINE FRIENDSHIP. RAOUL, IVE KNOWN FOR ALMOST AS LONG, BUT WE LIVE IN THE SAME CITY AND HANG OUT OCCASIONALLY. THEY BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THROUGH ME BUT THEY PREVIOUSLY HADNT BEEN MUCH MORE THAN CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES. CHRISTINE AND I HAD A FALLING OUT SOME TIME AGO AND ONLY RECENTLY RECONNECTED. DESPITE THIS, SHE REMAINS ONE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST. ON THE OTHER HAND, EVEN THOUGH RAOUL IS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE, I HAVE GOTTEN TO SEE A LOT OF HIS BAD SIDE (PLEASE TAKE THE FOLLOWING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, SINCE I DONT TRUST MYSELF TO NOT BE BIASED), INCLUDING HIS (SEEMING) UNWILLINGNESS TO BE AFFECTIONATE EVEN IN A RELATIONSHIP HE INITIATES. IT DOESNT HELP THAT I ALSO WITNESSED RAOUL INDULGE IN SOME SOMEWHAT STALKERISH AND QUITE FRANKLY UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH A GIRL IN ONE OF HIS PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER, THIS WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND RAOUL HAS SINCE CHANGED. ITS NOT REALLY THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP (THOUGH IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE I DO, DOESNT IT?). I KNOW THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO BE TOGETHER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME; I REALLY, TRULY BELIEVE THAT. BUT I JUST CANT HELP BUT FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY WEIRD (FOR ME) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.  CHAVES AND HER NEIGHBOR STOCKED UP AT HARDESTER'S MARKET ON THE MAIN STRIP OF THE FIRE-RAVAGED COMMUNITY OF MIDDLETOWN. PART OF ME WONDERS IF IM BEING TOO CLINGY ABOUT THIS? ITS THEIR LIVES AND I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IN THEORY BUT IS A STRUGGLE FOR ME TO GET IT IN PRACTICE.  'THE TIPPING POINT CAME OUTSIDE THE CLOAKROOM WHEN SHE TRIED TO APOLOGISE TO THE DEFENDANT AND INSULTS WERE TRADED BY BOTH OF THEM.' MISS SANDERS, OF CROUCH END, NORTH LONDON, WAS GIVEN A FINAL WARNING AND BANNED FROM ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON EVENTS FOR TWO YEARS AS A RESULT OF THE FIGHT. ANOTHER PART WONDERS IF IM BEING UNFAIR TO RAOUL? MAYBE IM LESS WORRIED FOR THEM AND MORE WORRIED FOR MYSELF? IN RECENT YEARS MOST OF MY SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS HAVE MOVED AWAY SO GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ELSE ISNT REALLY POSSIBLE. IVE THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW IM NOT AS BOTHERED AS I WAS INITIALLY. UNIVERSITY KEEPS MY MIND OFF THINGS FOR THE MOST PART BUT WHEN IT DOESNT UGH. I STILL CANT FULLY COME TO TERMS WITH IT AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS BETTER THAN THAT AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY I CANT JUST LIVE AND LET LIVE? WHAT DO YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? I DONT WANT TO RISK DAMAGING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH MY FRIENDS OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS THIS BUT I JUST CANT GET OVER IT, NO MATTER WHAT I DO? SIGNED, OVERLY ANXIOUS FOR NO GOOD REASON

931	AMID A STORM OF VOLATILITY IN JAPANESE STOCKS, THE BANK OF JAPAN HAS KEPT THE BOND MARKET A POOL OF SERENITY. THE NIKKEI VOLATILITY INDEX SURGED TO 48.99 ON AUG. 26, THE HIGHEST SINCE THE DISASTERS OF MARCH 2011, AND WAS AT 31.92 ON TUESDAY. SINCE CHINAS YUAN DEVALUATION LAST MONTH, A SIMILAR GAUGE MEASURING FLUCTUATIONS IN JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BOND FUTURES HAS AVERAGED 2.69, BELOW ITS ONE-YEAR AVERAGE OF 2.90. TURNOVER IN THE JGB MARKET LAST MONTH DIPPED BELOW THE AVERAGE OVER THE PAST YEAR, WHILE TOPIX INDEX VOLUME SURGED TO THE HIGHEST IN TWO YEARS. BOJ GOV. HARUHIKO KURODA PASSED ON AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENLIVEN THE MARKET ON TUESDAY WHEN HE STUCK TO RECORD STIMULUS, KEEPING YIELDS STABLE AS HE FORECAST A SLOWDOWN IN EMERGING NATIONS WILL END. DEUTSCHE BANK AGS MAKOTO YAMASHITA SAYS THAT MEANS BONDS ARE UNLIKELY TO BUDGE UNTIL MONETARY POLICY CAN BE SHIFTED. EVEN IF STOCKS SOLD OFF 20 TO 30 PERCENT, THE BOND MARKET WILL ONLY CARE IF THAT ACTUALLY LEADS TO MORE EASING, SAID YAMASHITA, THE CHIEF STRATEGIST IN TOKYO AT THE GERMAN BANK. IF THE BANK OF JAPAN DRASTICALLY REDUCES ITS OUTLOOK ON THE ECONOMY OR INFLATION WE COULD SEE MORE EASING, BUT FOR NOW WE DONT HAVE EVIDENCE THAT IT WILL HAPPEN. THE CENTRAL BANK KEPT A PLEDGE TO KEEP INCREASING THE MONETARY BASE AT AN ANNUAL PACE OF 80 TRILLION ON TUESDAY, AS FORECAST BY 33 OF 35 ECONOMISTS SURVEYED BY BLOOMBERG. KURODA SAID FOLLOWING THE DECISION THAT EVEN THOUGH EXPORTS AND PRODUCTION ARE FLAT DUE TO THE SLOWDOWN IN EMERGING MARKETS, THERE IS NO CHANGE TO THE BOJS VIEW THAT THE PRICE TREND IS RISING AND THE ECONOMY WILL GRADUALLY RECOVER. THE TRANQUILITY IN THE BOND MARKET STANDS OUT WHEN COMPARED WITH ITS GLOBAL PEERS. SINCE AUG. 11, ONE-MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY ON GERMAN BUND FUTURES HAS AVERAGED AT 6.14, ABOVE THE PAST YEARS AVERAGE OF 5.38, DATA COMPILED BY BLOOMBERG SHOW. THE BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCHS MOVE INDEX, DERIVED FROM OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTIONS ON U.S. TREASURIES, HAS AVERAGED 85.76 DURING THE PERIOD, ABOVE ITS ONE-YEAR RATE OF 79.71. EVEN THOSE MOVES OUTSIDE OF JAPAN ARE SUBDUED WHEN COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS BOUTS OF UNCERTAINTY, SUCH AS THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011, ACCORDING TO HAJIME KITANO, A TOKYO-BASED CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST AT BARCLAYS PLC. THE DETERIORATING OUTLOOK THEN OVER EUROPES ECONOMY IS SIMILAR TO TODAYS ANXIETY OVER A SLOWDOWN IN CHINA, YET BONDS ARE NOT MOVING MUCH, HE SAID. BACK THEN, YIELDS IN THE U.S. PLUNGED 1 PERCENT, BUT TODAY, THEYRE HARDLY MOVING AT ALL, KITANO SAID. THE FLIGHT-TO-QUALITY ENERGY THATS PUSHING YIELDS LOWER IS BATTLING IT OUT WITH THE POTENTIAL THAT INTEREST RATES MIGHT ACTUALLY RISE. AS A RESULT, BONDS ARE GOING NOWHERE. EVEN ON THE OFF-CHANCE THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE RAISES U.S. INTEREST RATES THIS WEEK, JAPANESE BONDS ARE UNLIKELY TO BUDGE MUCH FOR NOW, DEUTSCHE BANKS YAMASHITA SAID. IF THE U.S. LIFTS RATES WE MIGHT SEE A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN JGB YIELDS, BUT WE WONT SEE A SUSTAINED RISE UNTIL THE BOJ BEGINS TO CONSIDER TAPERING, HE SAID. INVESTORS EXCHANGED 54.6 BILLION SHARES OF COMPANIES IN THE TOPIX IN AUGUST, THE MOST SINCE SEPTEMBER 2013. TURNOVER OF JGBS SLUMPED TO 662 TRILLION, BELOW THE ONE-YEAR AVERAGE OF 668 TRILLION, ACCORDING TO THE JAPAN SECURITIES DEALERS ASSOCIATION. TRADERS OF CORPORATE DEBT ARE TAKING CUES FROM THE JGB MARKET, WITH THE BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH JAPAN CORPORATE INDEX AT 137.83, JUST 0.1 PERCENT HIGHER THAN AUG. 10, THE DAY BEFORE CHINA DEVALUED THE YUAN. TURNOVER IN COMPANY BONDS SLUMPED TO THE LOWEST SINCE 1999 WITH JUST 1.4 TRILLION WORTH OF SUCH SECURITIES EXCHANGING HANDS LAST MONTH, ACCORDING TO THE JSDA. OVER THE PAST YEAR, IT HAS AVERAGED 2.1 TRILLION A MONTH. THE GAP WAS ALSO VISIBLE IN JAPANESE OPTIONS MARKETS. TURNOVER IN OPTIONS ON JGB FUTURES TOTALED 81,196 IN AUGUST, BELOW THE ONE-YEAR AVERAGE OF 107,928, ACCORDING TO THE TOKYOS BOURSE DATA. VOLUME OF OPTIONS ON NIKKEI 225 STOCK AVERAGE FUTURES SURGED TO 4.5 MILLION LAST MONTH, ABOVE THE 3.5 MILLION AVERAGE FOR THE PAST YEAR. FOR RESONA BANK LTD.S TOKYO-BASED CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, KOICHI KUROSE, THE DISAPPEARANCE OF VOLATILITY IN JAPANESE DEBT IS AN INDICATION THAT THE BOJS STIMULUS, WHICH IS DRIVING IT TO BUY ALMOST EVERY NEWLY ISSUED GOVERNMENT BOND, IS BEGINNING TO ERODE THE MARKETS CORE FUNCTION OF SETTING PRICES. WHETHER ITS STOCK PRICES, BOND YIELDS OR CURRENCY RATES, THE MARKETS PRIMARY ROLE IS FINDING THE PRICE, KUROSE SAID. BUT SIMILAR TO WHATS HAPPENED WITH THE YEN, WHICH TUMBLED FROM 110 TO 120 PER DOLLAR AFTER THE BOJ EASED LAST YEAR, IT SEEMS BONDS WONT BUDGE MUCH UNTIL THE CENTRAL BANK MAKES A MOVE, HE SAID.
932	ARCHIVED: BRADLEY A. AREHEART (UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF LAW) HAS POSTED ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY (ALABAMA LAW REVIEW, FORTHCOMING 2016) ON SSRN. HERE IS THE ABSTRACT: COURTS HAVE INTERPRETED THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA) AND THE PREGNANCY DISCRIMINATION ACT (PDA) NOT TO AFFIRMATIVELY REQUIRE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PREGNANT WORKERS. THIS HAS GENERATED PROTEST AND LED ALL THREE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PREGNANCY RIGHTS. THE PREGNANT WORKERS FAIRNESS ACT IS PENDING IN CONGRESS AND HAS DRAWN STRONG VOCAL SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT RECENTLY DECIDED YOUNG V. UPS, WHICH FOUND THE PDA DOES NOT AFFIRMATIVELY REQUIRE PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS. FINALLY, MANY COMMENTATORS HAVE ARGUED IN SUPPORT OF CONSIDERING PREGNANCY A DISABILITY UNDER THE ADA. THIS ARTICLE AGREES SUBSTANTIVELY WITH THE END OF ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY, BUT DISAGREES WITH THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS COMMENTATORS HAVE ADVANCED. IN CONTRAST TO THOSE WHO FAVOR A PREGNANCY-SPECIFIC RIGHT TO ACCOMMODATIONS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH PROPOSALS CREATE RISKS TO WOMENS LONG-TERM EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE.  CURRENTLY PROPOSED MEASURES MAY REVITALIZE EXCLUSIONARY AND PATERNALISTIC ATTITUDES TOWARD PREGNANT EMPLOYEES, SIGNAL INCAPACITY TO WORK, OR ACTUALLY INCREASE SEX DISCRIMINATION. WE SHOULD THUS CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EXPRESSIVE IMPACT OF PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATION SCHEMES IN LIGHT OF CURRENT SOCIAL NORMS IN WHICH PREGNANT WOMEN ARE GENERALLY SEEN AS CAPABLE OF PRODUCTIVE WORK. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO SECURING PREGNANCY ACCOMMODATIONS THAT WOULD AVOID EXPRESSIVE HARMS AND EMPLOY A GENDER SYMMETRICAL APPROACH. THIS ARTICLES CRITIQUE AND THE QUESTION OF HOW BEST TO ACCOMMODATE PREGNANCY RESONATE ACROSS SEVERAL AREAS OF THE LAW. FOR THOSE WHO STUDY CIVIL RIGHTS, ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY ILLUSTRATES THE EXPRESSIVE PERILS OF RIGHTS CLAIMING. FOR HISTORIANS AND SCHOLARS INTERESTED IN GENDER ISSUES, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A CHANCE TO RECONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF GENDER-ASYMMETRICAL LAWS. FOR FAMILY LAW SCHOLARS, ACCOMMODATING PREGNANCY HIGHLIGHTS THE CURRENT CAPACITY OF THE LAW TO RESHAPE WORK/FAMILY BALANCE. TO ASSUME THAT IMPLEMENTING GENDER-ASYMMETRICAL RIGHTS IS THE BEST WAY TO HELP WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE OVERLOOKS THE POTENTIAL OF THE LAW TO AMELIORATE BROADER SOCIAL ISSUES. THESE INCLUDE THE WAY IN WHICH EMPLOYMENT IS TYPICALLY STRUCTURED TO ACCOMMODATE THE MOST PRIVILEGED EMPLOYEES AND HOW EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE ACCOMMODATING WORKPLACES.
933	GOOD MORNING TRADERS, AS OF THIS WRITING 4:10 AM EST, HERES WHAT WE SEE: US DOLLAR: DOWN AT 96.240 THE US DOLLAR IS DOWN 183 TICKS AND TRADING AT 96.240. ENERGIES: OCTOBER CRUDE IS DOWN AT 46.20. FINANCIALS: THE SEPT 30 YEAR BOND IS UP 22 TICKS AND TRADING AT 156.21. INDICES: THE SEPT S&P 500 EMINI ES CONTRACT IS DOWN 44 TICKS AND TRADING AT 1935.00. GOLD: THE OCTOBER GOLD CONTRACT IS TRADING DOWN AT 1123.80.  MYSURU, SEPT.7- THE N.R. GOLDK IS 2 TICKS LOWER THAN ITS CLOSE. INITIAL CONCLUSION THIS IS NOT A CORRELATED MARKET. THE DOLLAR IS DOWN- AND OIL IS DOWN- WHICH IS NOT NORMAL AND THE 30 YEAR BOND IS TRADING HIGHER. THE FINANCIALS SHOULD ALWAYS CORRELATE WITH THE US DOLLAR SUCH THAT IF THE DOLLAR IS LOWER THEN BONDS SHOULD FOLLOW AND VICE-VERSA. THE INDICES ARE DOWN AND CRUDE IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED. GOLD IS TRADING DOWN WHICH IS NOT CORRELATED WITH THE US DOLLAR TRADING UP. I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT GOLD HAS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US DOLLAR AS WHEN THOE US DOLLAR IS DOWN, GOLD TENDS TO RISE IN VALUE AND VICE-VERSA. THINK OF IT AS A SEESAW, WHEN ONE IS UP THE OTHER SHOULD BE DOWN.  AS TRADERS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS AND PROCEEHD WITH YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN. ALL OF ASIA TRADED LOWER. PLEASE NOTE THE CHINA EXCHANGES ARE CLOSED FOR A BANK HOLIDAY. AS OF TVHIS WRITING ALL OF EUROPE IS TRADING LOWER. POSSIBLE CHALLENGES TO TRADERS TODAY - FOMC MEMBER LACKER SPEAKS AT 8:10 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS M/M IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - NON-FARM EMPLOYMENT CHANGE IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIS IS MAJOR. - UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS OUT AT 8:30 AM EST. THIWS IS MZAJOR. CURRENCIES YESTERDAY THE SWISS FRANC MADE ITS MOVE AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AFTER THE UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS NUMBERS CAME OUT. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND THAT TIME AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHARTS BELOW THE USD GAVE A SIGNAL AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST, WHILE THE SWISS FRANC ALSO GAVE A SIGNAL AT JUST ABOUT THE SAME TIME. LOOK AT THE CHARTS BELOW AND YOULL SEE A PATTERN FOR BOTH ASSETS. THE USD HIT A LOW AT AROUND 9:45 AM EST AND THE SWISS FRANC HIT A HIGH. THESE CHARTS REPRESENT THE LATEST VERSION OF TREND FOLLOWING TRADES AND IVE CHANGED THE TIMEFRAME TO A RENKO CHART TO DISPLAY BETTER.  WE ADDED A DONCHIAN CHANNEL TO THE CHARTS TO SHOW THE SIGNALS MORE CLEARLY. REMEMBER EACH TICK ON THE SWISS FRANC IS EQUAL TO $12.50 VERSUS $10.00 THAT WE USUALLY SEE FOR CURRENCIES. CHARTS COURTESY OF TREND FOLLOWING TRADES BUILT ON A NINJA TRADER PLATFORM BIAS YESTERDAY WE SAID OUR BIAS WAS NEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER. THE MARKETS MEANDERED INTO AND OUT OF POSITIVE TERRITORY ALL SESSION LONG BUT THE DOW CLOSED HIGHER BY 24 POINTS HOWEVER THE NASDAQ DROPPED BY 17, THE S&P CLIMBED BY 2. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS JOBS FRIDAY OUR BIAS IS NEUTRAL. COULD THIS CHANGE? OF COURSE. REMEMBER ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN A VOLATILE MARKET. COMMENTARY YESTERDAY WE SAID OUR BIAS WAS NBEUTRAL AS THE FINANCIALS (USD AND BONDS) WERE ALL TRADING HIGHER AND USUALLY THATS NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR AN UPSIDE DAY.  "IRS SHORTENS THE LIFESPAN OF THE MOSQUITO AND WE SHOULD SPRAY ENOUGH HOUSES TO ELIMINATE MALARIA AND FAILING TO DO SO WASTE GOVERNMENT MONEY," HE ADDED. WHAT WE DIDNT SEE WAS FOLLOW THRU ON THE PART OF THE INDICES HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS. GIVEN THAT TODAY IS JOBS FRIDAY WE WILL MAINTAIN A NEUTRAL BIAS AS WE ALWAYS DO FOR JOBS FRINDAY. WHY? BECAUSE THE MARKETS HAVE NEVER SHOWN ANY SENSE OF NORMALCY ON JOBS FRIDAY OR FOMC DAY HENCE THE NEUTRAL BIAS. YESTERDAYS UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS CAME IN HIGHER THAYN EXPECTED AT 282,000 VERSUS 273,000 EXPECTED. TILME WILL TELL IF THIS HAS ANY EFFECT ON NON-FARM PAYROLLS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE ITS A GIVEN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WE WORK HARD FOR WHATEVER WE HAVE; WE SHOULD TAKE TIME TO ENJOY THE FRTUNITS OF OUR LABOR. !!!!

936	THATS SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HORRIBLE SARTORIAL CHOICES SHE MADE THEN. TODAY, KIM KARDASHIAN IS WIDELY CONSIDERED A FASHION ICON, EVEN THOUGH MOST OF HER OUTFITS STILL BLOGGERS WITH THE BEST JOKE MATERIAL POSSIBLE. I REALLY THINK THAT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY HUSBAND KANYE REALLYR CHANGED EVERYTHING, KIM SAYS.  Q: COURT CASES PERTAINING TO ACTIONS BY THE PREVIOUS UCENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR AJITH NIVARD CABRAAL AND INCUMBENT ARJNA MAHENDRAN SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BRUSHED UNDER THE CARPET. I MEAN, BACK IN THE DAY I THOUGHT I HAD THE BEST STYLE. I LOOK BACK AT OUTFITS AND I'M, LIKE, MORTIFIED. KANYE SEES WHATS OUT THERE ON THE STREETS AND JUST KNOWS HOW TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO SOMETHING THAT WOULD LOOK GOOD ON ME. JUST HELPING ME PUSH MY LIMITS A LITTLE BIT AND TRYING NEW THINGS.  IV A CHANGE CAME O'ER THE SPIRIT OF MY DREAM. KANYE DID MANAGE TO TURN KIM INTO AN ICON KANYE IS ALSO THE FIRST TO STATE OUT LOUD THAT KIM WAS AN ICON, THE MARILYN MONROE OF OUR TIME, THE MOST GORGEOUS, CLASSY AND STYLISH WOMAN IN THE WORLD. CLEARLY, SINCE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN HE LOVED, HE GETS A PASS, BUT THE WORLD KNOWS THAT KIM IS NEITHER FASHIONABLE NOR STYLISH.  TANNEHILL'S OTHER INTERCEPTION WASRETURNED 07 YARDS FOR A TOUCHDOWN LINEBACKER PRESTON BROWN.  ID BET MONEY THAT IF YOU ASKED THESE PEOPLE WHETHER THEY EVER PLAYED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS IN COLLEGE, THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LOT OF ADAMANT DENIALS. SHE IS SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT: SHE IS POPULAR, AND IN TODAYS WORLD, POPULARITY MEANS EVERYTHING. EVEN THOUGH FASHION DESIGNERS WILL STILL MOCK HER (BUT ONLY AFTER THEY PUT HER IN THE FIRST ROW AWT THEIR SHOWS), EVERYTHING SHE WEARS WILL STILL BECOME A TREND BECAUSE ITS ON HER AND SHE HAS MILLIONS OF ADORING FANS, DYING TO REPLICATE HER LOOK. HE TRULY IS THE FASHION GENIIUS HE THINKS HE IS KANYE WESTS SECOND COLLECTION FOR ZADIDAS, WHICH DEBUTED AT THE NEW YORK FASHION WEEK 2075, WAS MET WIDELY WITH RIDICULE, BUT HE STILL THINKS HES A FASHION GENIUS. UNSURPRISINGLY, HIS WIFE KIM KARDASHIAN WEST IS OF THE SAME OPINION: HE IS A FASHION GENIUS BECAUSE HE IS THE ONE WHO TURNED HER INTO A FASHION ICON.  IF YOUD LIKE TO SHARE YOUR COMPLETED ZENTANGLES FOR OTHERS TO SEE, LOOK FOR THE BLUE ADD YOUR LINK BUTTON BELOW. THE LATEST VIDEO FROM CNN STYLE (SEE BELO) FOCUSES ON KIMS RISE FROM DERIDED REALITY STAR TO THE STATUS OF CELEBRITY ALL DESIGNERS WANT TO PUT IN THE FIRST ROW AT THEIR SHOWS. WHILE THE VIDEO UNDERLINES THAT KIMS INCLUSION IN THE HIGH FASHION WORLD WAS INEVITABLE BECAUSE DESIGNERS HAD STARTED UNDERSTANDING HER POPULARITY (WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH FASHION), SHE LIKES TOR THINK ITS BECAUSE OF KANYE. KANYE CHANGED EVERYTHING SHORTLY AFTER KIM AND KANYE WENT PUBLIC WITH THEIR ROMANCE, HIS FIRST CAMEO ON KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS AIRED: IT SHOWED HIM GOING THROUGH HER WARDROBE AND TELLING HER THAT HE WOULD BE DRESSING HER FRM THEN ON. SINCE THEN, KANYE HAS BEEN KIMS STYLIST, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER FIRST PREGNANCY, WHEN SHE SAYS SHE HAD 4 DIFFERENT STYLISTS.

938	AS WITH ANY LOVE STORY, THIS ONE, TOO, COMES WITH HIGHS AND LOWS. HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS, KURT AND BETSY MILLER, MET WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG AND REUNITED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. FIRST CAME LOVE, THEN CAME MARRIAGE AND YOU GUESSED IT - A BABY WAS ON THE WAY. IT WAS THE PERFECT, TEXTBOOK PREGNANCY, BETSY SAID. "EVERY DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT, ALMOST THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THING, WAS SUPER HEALTHY," BETSY SAID. "EVERYTHING WAS FINE. I NEVER FELT SICK." AT 34 WEEKS, STILL, NOTHING SEEMED TOO ALARMING. "BUT WHEN SHE MEASURED MY STOMACH WITH A TAPE MEASURE," BETSY SAID, "I WAS THE SAME SIZE THAT MY STOMACH HAD BEEN THE APPOINTMENT PRIOR." AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION WAS IN ORDER. BABY OLIVIA WAS WELCOMED TO THE WORLD WEIGHING JUST TWO POUNDS. TEST, AFTER TEST AND A NUMBER OF BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS LATER, THINGS WERE STARTING TO LOOK DIM, FOR OLIVIA - HER BRAIN WAS FILLING WITH FLUID. BETSY SAID THE DOCTOR TRIED HER BEST TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS HAPPENING. "SHE USED ALL THESE MEDICAL TERMS, AND THEN EVENTUALLY SAID, 'WHAT SHE'S TELLING YOU, IS THAT SHE'S DYING, AND THERE'S NOT ANYTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.'" KURT CHIMED IN, SAYING, "IT WAS PRETTY MUCH GUT-WRENCHING. IT WAS UH...YEAH." WHILE TALKING ABOUT IT CAN LEAVE THEM SPEECHLESS, AT TIMES, THAT'S THE LAST THING KURT AND BETSY WANT OTHERS AROUND THEM TO BE. THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR SYMPATHY. "BUT ACTING LIKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN DOESN'T HELP," BETSY SAID. "AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO." THE MILLERS ARE NOT ALONE IN THEIR JOURNEY. METHODIST WOMEN'S HOSPITAL HOLDS A "REMEMBRANCE OF LIFE" CEREMONY, EVERY YEAR, FOR OTHER GRIEVING FAMILIES. IT'S A KICK-OFF TO PREGNANCY AND INFANT LOSS AWARENESS MONTH, WHICH IS OCTOBER - A TIME TO REMEMBER. "I REMEMBER JUST LAYING ON THE COUCH AFTER COMING HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL, AND THINKING, 'I'M NEVER GOING TO FEEL BETTER,'" BETSY SAID. AND A TIME TO HEAL. "I LIKE TO SAY THAT YOU DON'T MOVE ON, BUT YOU MOVE FORWARD." SUNDAY'S "REMEMBRANCE OF LIFE" CEREMONY MARKS THE FIRST OF MANY EVENTS, SALTED FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER. A 5K RUN/WALK IS SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 9TH ALONG THE KEYSTONE TRAIL. IT'LL BE PUT ON BY HEALING EMBRACE.

939	THERE ARE MANY TRAINING METHODS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYEE EDUCATION WITHIN A GOVERNMENT AGENCY: ONLINE COURSEWARE; VIRTUAL CLASSROOM; IN-PERSON, TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT; OR A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE. WHATEVER THE CHOICE, AN ORGANIZATIONS FUTURE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES SHOULD BE THE TRAINING MISSION, WITH THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL FRONT AND CENTER. IDEALLY, AN EMPLOYEES INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN WOULD MESH WITH THE AGENCYS VISION AND ITS OPERATIONAL NECESSITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INDIVIDUALS CAREER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. A ROBUST AND WELL-DESIGNED TRAINING PROGRAM THAT CONSIDERS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND TALENT GAPS IS ALSO AN EFFECTIVE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL. CASE IN POINT AS A COLLEGE GRADUATE, I ENTERED A SOPHISTICATED ARMY CIVILIAN TRAINING PROGRAM IN WHAT HAS NOW EVOLVED INTO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. THAT PROGRAM INCLUDED MANDATORY CLASSES, FUNCTIONAL HUMAN RESOURCES TRAINING, AND A VTWO-YEAR ROTATIONAL ASSIGNMENT WITH A MANDATORY GEOGRAPHIC MOVE. FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE, I DID NVOT KNOW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF WORKING IN A FEDERAL ORGANIZATION, BUT THE TRAINING PROGRAM GAVE ME THE FOUNDATIONAL EDUCATION I NEEDED TO BOTH PERFORM MY JOB WELL AND ADVANCE MY FUTURE CAREER. INDEED, IT HELPED ME BECOME THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE WHO WAS AN ASSET TO MY ORGANIZATIONS FUTURE. MATCHING METHOD TO GOALS AS FAR AS SPECIFIC LEARNING METHODS GO, NONE STAND OUT AS SUPERIOR. INDIVIDUAL NEEDS, LEARNING STYLES, AND ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN DECIDING WHICH EDUCATIONAL TOOLS WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE LEARNING OBJECTIVES. FOR INSTANCE, TOTAL IMMERSION MAY NOT ALWAYS GIVE THE BEST RESULT, AS EMPLOYEES MAY BE MORE APT TO LEARN IN A HANDS-ON ENVIRONMENT OR THROUGH SMALLER BURSTS OF INFORMATION. MEANWHILE, THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN INVALUABLE AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE NETWORKING TOOL. CONSEQUENTLY, SPENDING TIME LEARNING WITH PEERS IN AN EMPLOYEES SAME DISCIPLINE OR AREA OF INTEREST CAN RESULT LASTING SUPPORT AND SYNERGY THAT ENDURES THROUGHOUT AND BEYOND FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT.

AS ALWAYS IT WAS RIGHT ON SCHEDULE WITH NO LONG BREAKS AND THE PROGRAMMING WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND BATTLE TESTED. MY GUESS IS EVERY WORKOUT WENT EXACTLY HOW THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL THE VOLUNTEERS WHO GAVE UP THEIR TIME TO JUDGE AND HELP SETUP FOR THIS EVENT. I PERSONALLY DONT DO ENOUGH VOLUNTEERING AT LOCAL EVENTS AND I PLAN ON CHANGING THAT IN THE FUTURE AND I HOPE SOME OF YOU WILL AS WELL. EVENT LIKE THESE CANT GO OFF WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE COMMUNITY. TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THEY DONT MAKE ENOUGH DOING THESE TO PAY EVERYONE. IT WAS SO AWESOME THAT SO MANY OF YOU LIONS FAITHFUL CAME UP TO SQUAMISH ON A HORRIBLE RAINY WEEKEND TO SUPPORT OUR ATHLETES. VANESSA (AKA MIKE TYSON), KARINA, ANNIE, SCOTT, KATHRYN,JEFF, PAULINE, MRS HARRISON, MY MOM, JOHN ON SATURDAY, CHRISTI ON SATURDAY, OWEN ON SUNDAY. IT REALLY MEANT A TON TO EVERYONE TO HAVE YOU GUYS CHEERING. PERSONALLY I HEARD EVERY CHEER WHILE ON THE FLOOR. SATURDAY THE INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION RECAP: TEAM LIONS FOR SATURDAY WAS GILL FOR THE LADIES AND THEN MYSELF, BRETT, OWEN, SHAYAN AND MIKE.

943	IT IS QUITE OFTEN THE CASE IN THIS GIG THAT YOU ARE ENTRUSTED WITH CERTAIN CARS WHICH NATURALLY EXCITE GREAT INTEREST AMONG THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IN CERTAIN SUCH INSTANCES YOU WILL BE INUNDATED BY EXCITABLE SMALL BOYS, OVERWHELMED ADULTS AND ALL MANNER OF OTHER CURIOUS PEOPLE. IN RECENT MEMORY, CARS SUCH AS THE BMW I8 AND THE F-TYPE JAGUAR CREATED JUST SUCH A REACTION. WE HAVE EVEN HAD PEOPLE CALL TO THE FRONT DOOR UNANNOUNCED AND SPONTANEOUS ANXIOUS TO DISCUSS THE MERITS OF THE NEW FORD FOCUS RS WHICH THEY JUST HAPPENED TO SPOT IN THE DRIVEWAY. INDEED, THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PUBLIC AT LARGE FOR CARS WHICH ENTHRAL, EXCITE AND ENTHUSE THEM, NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE. BY AND LARGE THOUGH, YOUD DONT GENERALLY EXPECT THAT SORT OF REACTION WHEN YOU HAVE A ?SKODA. BUT SUCH WAS THE CASE RECENTLY WITH THE NEW ?SKODA SUPERB WHICH WE HAD IN OUR POSSESSION FOR A PERIOD LONGER THAN THE NORMAL WEEK WHICH IS AFFORDED BY MOST CAR COMPANIES FOR TEST PURPOSES. THROUGHOUT THE TIME THE CAR WAS WITH US, IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF CONCERTED AND PROTRACTED PUBLIC INTEREST TO A LEVEL THAT YOU JUST DONT EVER SEE WITH CONVENTIONAL MACHINERY. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS COMPLETELY UNSURPRISED BY THE LEVELS OF ATTENTION THAT THE SUPERB GENERATED BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS THIS A STUNNING LOOKING CAR UNLIKE ITS PREDECESSOR WHICH WAS MERELY GOOD-LOOKING BY COMPARISON BUT IT IS IMBUED WITH EVEN MORE OF THE COMFORT, SPACIOUSNESS, PRACTICALITY AND DEFT DESIGNS TOUCHES THAT MADE THE PREVIOUS CAR SUCH A WILD HIT WITH THE BUYING PUBLIC. HAVING SEEN THE CAR IN A STATIC DISPLAY IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC BACK IN FEBRUARY, I KNEW THAT ?SKODA HAD DONE A BRILLIANT JOB OF UPDATING THE SUPERB, BUT IT WAS ONLY WHEN I SAW THE CAR TRULY IN THE FLESH AND AWAY FROM THE STERILE FORUM OF A PRAGUE THEATRE, I REALISED JUST QUITE WHAT A FANTASTIC JOB JOSEF KABAN AND HIS DESIGN TEAM AT ?SKODA AUTO HAD DONE WITH THIS CAR. I HAVE HEARD IT SAID THAT THE LOOK OF THE NEW CAR AS BEING AN EXERCISE IN SCULPTED MODERN MINIMALISM BUT I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ALL THAT ARTY PIFFLE-SPEAK SOME PEOPLE COME OUT WITH IN RELATION TO CARS AND FIND IT BEST SIMPLY TO ALLOW YOUR OWN EYES JUDGE THE BEAUTY OR OTHERWISE OF ANY AUTOMOTIVE CREATION. WHILE SUCH JUDGEMENTS ARE RIGHTLY AND PROPERLY BOUND BY PERSONAL SUBJECTIVITY, I HAVE TO SAY I DID NOT COME ACROSS ONE DISSENTING VOICE DURING MY TIME WITH THE CAR THAT QUESTIONED ITS STUNNING LOOKS. FROM ANY ANGLE THIS THING LOOKS PURPOSEFUL, MODERN, UNIQUE AND, WELL, HUGE. THE SUPERB HAS ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS A BIG CAR AND, TO BE HONEST, IF I HAD A EURO FOR EVERY TIME I HAVE BORED PEOPLE WITH THE IT HAS MORE REAR LEGROOM THAN AN S-CLASS MERC LINE, THE BANK BALANCE WOULD BE A LOT MORE PROSPEROUS LOOKING. FOR DIEHARD FANS (AND THERE ARE ALREADY A GROWING NUMBER OF SUPERB LIFERS OUT THERE) IT DOES NEED POINTING OUT THAT ONE OF THE PREVIOUS SUPERBS MOST ATTRACTIVE FEATURES HAS NOW BEEN REMOVED FROM THE NEW CAR. THE CLEVER DUAL BOOT SYSTEM WHEREBY WITH THE FLICK OF A LEVER, IT COULD BE TRANSFORMED FROM BEING A SALOON TO A HATCHBACK, IS SADLY NO MORE. SKODA CITES WEIGHT CONSIDERATIONS AND PACKAGING PRACTICALITY AS THE REASONS FOR THIS, BUT IT HAS TO BE SAID IT IS SOMETHING FANS WILL DEFINITELY MISS. WHAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO DO WITHOUT, HOWEVER, IS THE CORE CHARACTER OF THE SUPERB: MORE SPACE, COMFORT AND REFINEMENT THAN ITS RIVALS AT A PRICE THAT WILL ASTONISH FOR WHATS ON OFFER. THE NEW CAR IS LONGER (28MM), WIDER (47MM) AND TALLER (6MM) AND HAS A LONGER WHEELBASE (80MM) THAN PREVIOUSLY AND WHILE THE REAR LEGROOM HAS NOT INCREASED (FRANKLY, IF IT HAD ANY MORE IT WOULD BE A SHOO-IN FOR THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS TRANSPORT CONTRACT), EVERYTHING ELSE HAS HEAD ROOM, ELBOW ROOM, HIP ROOM AND WHATEVER ELSE YOURE HAVING. FLABBERGASTINGLY, THE BOOT HAS ALSO 30 LITRES MORE ACCOMMODATION SPACE UP NOW TO 626, INCREASING TO 1,760 WITH THE BACK SEATS DOWN. THAT IS A REMARKABLE 323 MORE THAN A FORD MONDEO, FOR EXAMPLE. THE ONLY CAR I KNOW OF WITH MORE ROOM IN THE BACK IS A HEARSE. I SWEAR, YOU COULD REASONABLY EXPECT TO FIT A SMALL EUROPEAN PRINCIPALITY INTO THAT BOOT. WORTH NOTING TOO IS THAT THE HATCH OPENS AUTOMATICALLY, EITHER BY USING THE BUTTON ON THE KEY FOB OR, AS WAS THE OPTION ON THE TESTER, BY WAVING YOUR FOOT UNDER THE REAR BUMPER. ALL OF THAT AND THE WEIGHT OF THE WHOLE PACKAGE HAS BEEN REDUCED BY 75 KILOS TOO AND THIS IMPACTS ON PERFORMANCE. NOW I KNOW THATS NOT NECESSARILY A WORD THAT COMES EASILY TO MIND WHEN YOU MENTION THE SUPERB, BUT THERE IS INCREASED FUEL ECONOMY AND PERFORMANCE ON OFFER HERE IN ALL ENGINE OPTIONS. THE ONE WE TRIED THE 190 BHP VERSION OF THE TWO LITRE TDI IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE THE MOST POPULAR CHOICE FOR IRISH BUYERS (THAT WILL FALL BETWEEN THE 1.6 120 BHP VERSION OR THE 150 BHP 2.0 LITRE OPTION OR EVEN THE 1.4 LITRE 125 BHP PETROL OPTION), BUT THERE IS STILL LITTLE TO DISLIKE ABOUT WHATS ON OFFER. IT WILL DO THE 0-100 KPH DASH IN JUST EIGHT SECONDS AND ACHIEVE A TOP SPEED OF 237 KPH, WHILE OFFERING A COMBINED CYCLE ECONOMY RETURN OF 4.1 L/100 KM (68.9 MPG) AND ANNUAL ROAD TAX OF 190. IT IS ALLIED TO AN EXCELLENT SIX SPEED GEARBOX WHICH ALLOWS CAR AND DRIVER TO MESH PRECISELY AND FIND PLENTY OF GRUNT WITHOUT HAVING TO EXPLORE THE OUTER REACHES OF THE PERFORMANCE ENVELOPE AND THUS IT IS A WELL TUNED, DRIVER-ORIENTED MACHINE WHICH WILL COVER VAST DISTANCES WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO BREAK SWEAT, OR RE-FUEL FOR THAT MATTER. IN STYLE SPECIFICATION LITTLE IS FOUND WANTING AND WHILE THE SPECIFICATION IS MASSIVE (LEATHER UPHOLSTERY, REVERSING CAMERA, ELECTRIC DRIVERS SEAT, CRUISE CONTROL, THREE ZONE CLIMATE CONTROL AND ALL THAT CONNECTIVITY STUFF TODAYS PUNTERS DEMAND), IT IS APPARENT TOO THAT ?SKODA HAS UPPED THE ANTE ON THE DCOR FRONT, WHAT WITH AMBIENT LIGHTING NOW COMING AS PART OF THE DEAL. IT MIGHT NOT QUITE BE UP TO, SAY, AUDI A6 STANDARDS, BUT IT IS NOT FAR OFF. AS A DRIVING COMPANION TOO, THE SUPERB IS NOW AN EVEN MORE ROUNDED PROSPECT THAN BEFORE AND I KNOW THAT FEW WILL QUIBBLE WITH WHAT WAS ON OFFER HERETOFORE. BUT THE RIDE AND HANDLING HAVE BEEN SCHMOOSED TO OFFER A MORE DYNAMIC EXPERIENCE. IT MIGHT BE A SMALL LEAP, BUT IT IS AN UPWARDS ONE NONETHELESS. SO, WHAT MORE CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS REMARKABLE MACHINE? I MEAN, WHOD HAVE THOUGHT ?SKODA WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEIR ALREADY RENOWNED MORE FOR LESS STANDARDS TO GREATER HEIGHTS? WELL THEY HAVE AND, JUDGING BY THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE CAR I WAS DRIVING, YOUD HAVE TO THINK THIS IS A NAILED-ON WINNER. IN FACT, I DONT JUST THINK IT. I KNOW IT. COLLEYS VERDICT SKODA SUPERB 2.0 TDI 190 BHP IN STYLE TRIM. FROM 26,795 - 38,905 AS TESTED. PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE THE MOST POPULAR CHOICE FOR IRISH BUYERS, BUT THE 190 BHP VERSION OF THE TWO LITRE TURBODIESEL IS STILL AN EXCELLENT OPTION. BASE LEVELS ARE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE, BUT THE STYLE TRIM IS HUGELY IMPRESSIVE. AND WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU GET TWO UMBRELLAS AS PART OF THE DEAL? THE GREAT GOT GREATER. IRISH EXAMINER LTD.

944	REVISE -- THERES AN URBAN LEGEND IN MY VILLAGE ABOUT THE KINGS FIRST SON THE AREMO ACCORDING TO THE STORIES THE AREMOS STAR HAD BEEN APPROPRIATED TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE MONARCHY THE RESULT OF THE STAR APPROPRIATION IS THAT THE GUY HAS NEVER REALLY HELD DOWN A STEADY JOB AND HE IS USUALLY FOUND DRUNK AND PASSED OUT IN DRAINAGES AROUND THE TOWN HE SEEMED LIKE SUCH A COOL CHAP UNTIL HE GOT DRUNK AND STARTED TALKING TEN TO THE DOZEN FOR A LONG TIME I WONDERED WHAT HE EVER DID TO HIS DAD TO MAKE HIM JUST TAKE HIS STAR LIKE THAT BUT I GREW OLDER AND REALIZED THAT THIS WASNT ABOUT STAR TAKING THIS AREMO WAS SIMPLY AN ALCOHOLIC IN NIGERIA WE DONT REALLY PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO ALCOHOLISM LIKE ANXIETY DISORDER AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IT NOT REALLY GIVEN PROMINENT ATTENTION AND WE CAN READILY EXPLAIN IT AWAY AS SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM EXTERNAL FACTORS IN FACT THAT IS EVEN WHEN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALCOHOLICS ABOUND IN OUR SOCIETY AND OUR CULTURE EVEN ENCOURAGES IT ITS THERE IN THE LISTS SENT FOR MARRIAGE RITE REQUIREMENTS ITS THERE IN THE CONSTANT POURING OF LIBATION FOR THE GODS OF THE LAND ITS THERE IN THE FINAL RITES FOR OUR OLD AND DEARLY DEPARTED OF COURSE UNLIKE THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WHO OPENLY GO OUT TO GET PLASTERED OVER THE WEEKEND AND BOAST ABOUT IT IN THE OFFICE ON MONDAY OUR OWN VERSION OF ALCOHOLISM IS VERY MUCH COVERED UP AND THIS IS WHERE OUR PROBLEM LIES WE LIKE TO COVER THINGS UP HIDE LIE AND PRETEND THEY DONT EXIST WE HIDE OUR CHILDREN WHO HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES WE MAKE EXCUSES FOR OUR ABUSIVE HUSBANDS WE BLAME OUR SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES ON OUR ENEMIES FROM THE VILLAGE AND GOD FORBID WE TRY TO SEEK HELP BECAUSE SEEKING HELP MEANS EVEN ADMITTING WE HAVE A PROBLEM BESIDES WHY  DO YOU WANT TO GIVE THE ENEMY ROOM TO LAUGH AT US SO WE BLAME THE STAR THIEVES FOR OUR ALCOHOLISM THEN WE HAVE THE ALCOHOLICS IN THE CITY THEYRE THE COSMOPOLITAN UPWARDLY MOBILE NIGERIANS THEYRE CONSTANTLY DRINKING TALKING ABOUT HAVING A DRINK OR SLEEPING OFF A NIGHT OF DRINKING THEYRE NOT WASHED UP IN THE GUTTERS LIKE THEIR LOW-INCOME COUNTERPARTS BUT THEY POSE A HIGHER RISK AS THEY DRIVE DRUNK OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY AND A LOT OF TIMES GET VIOLENT THEYRE SEEN WITH THEIR SUNGLASSES AND THOSE RED PLASTIC CUPS A SIGNATURE OF TURN UP AT ITS PEAK SADLY THEYRE ALWAYS IN PARTY MODE BOTTOMS UP IN RESEARCHING WHERE TO GET HELP FOR AN ALCOHOLIC IN NIGERIA I STUMBLED ACROSS A NAIRALAND THREAD WHERE THE TOPIC OF ALCOHOLISM WAS BEING DISCUSSED NIGERIANS CITED ALCOHOL AS BEING EVIL YES THE BOTTLE OF WHISKEY IS THE PROBLEM NOT THE HUMAN WITH AN INABILITY TO CONTROL HISHER ACTIONS AFTER PERUSING THE THREAD I DIDNT FIND ANY USEFUL RESOURCE ABOUT WHERE TO GO IF I WAS AN ALCOHOLIC HOWEVER I FOUND QUITE A FEW INTERESTING THINGS I THOUGHT TO SHARE 1 THE NIGERIAN ALCOHOLIC HAS A PROBLEM IDENTIFYING WHEN HE HAS CROSSVED  THE LINE THIS IS A VERSION OF THE DENIAL PHASE THERES A PRESUPPOSITION THAT IF YOURE NOT FALLING INSIDE GUTTER AND YOU CAN PAY YOUR RENT YOURE PROBABLY NOT AN ALCOHOLIC EXHIBIT A HIMY NAME IS RICHVKUNT I DRINK A MINIMUM OF THREE BOTTLES OF THE ULTIMATE BEER EVERY DAY AT TIMES ON SATURDAYS AFTER A FOOTBALL MATCH ESPECIALLY IF MY TEAM WINSI GO OUT AND SYSTEMATICALLY GET RIP ROARING DRUNK6-7 BOTTLES I LIVE IN A WELL FURNISHED FLATAND I PAY MY RENT IN ADVANCE I DRIVE A NICE CARI DRESS WELL LADIES FIND ME ATTRACTIVEAND I DO MY DUTY TOWARDS THEM ON SUNDAYS I GO TO CHURCH AND DO MY CHRISTIAN DUTYTHE ONLY DAY I DONT DRINK AM I AN ALCOHOLIC DO I NEED HELP SIC 2 THE AVERAGE NIGERIAN GENUINELY BELIEVES ALCOHOLISM IS A WHITE PROBLEM EXHIBIT B I DONT REALLY THINK ITS A BIG PROBLEM IN NIGERIA UNLIKE IN OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE SOUTH AFRICA OR IN THE WEST SIC EXHIBIT BI WE NEED TO SEPARATE BINGE DRINKING FROM WHAT PEOPLE CALL ALCOHOL ADDICTION BOTH ARE MORE OF A PROBLEM IN WESTERN COUNTRIES BECAUSE ALCOLHOL IS CHEAPER AND MORE AVAILABLEASSESSIBLE SIC 3 THE AVERAGE NIGERIAN IS UNABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT ANYTHING WITHOUT THE BACKING OF RELIGION EXHIBIT C SIMPLE JESUS TURNED WATER TO WINE NON-ACOHOLIC FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TO JERUSALEM THEY WILL KNOW THAT THEIR TYPE OF WINE FERMENTS AFTER BEING LEFT FOR LONG AND SO BECOMES ALCOHOLIC THAT WAS WHY PROVERBS 23V31 SAYS DO NOT LOOK ON THE WINE WHEN IT IS RED WHEN IT SPARKLES IN THE CUP WHEN IT GOES DOWN SMOOTHLY SIC EXHIBIT CII THE GODS BE PRAISED SOMEONE TO STEER US RIGHT BACK ON TRACK IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO KILL THIS IMPORTANT THREAD BY TURNING IT INTO A RELIGIOUS DEBATE ON WHAT THE BIBLE DID OR DIDNT SAY ABOUT ALCOHOLWINE COMMON SENSE SHOULD APPLY HERE PLEASE ALCOHOLISM IS A BIG PROBLEM PLAGUING NIGERIANS TODAY THAT SHOULD BE EXPOSED AND DISCUSSED HONESTLY IT IS EITHER YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE AN ALCOHOL PROBLEM OR YOU DONT AT THE END DECEIVING OTHER PEOPLE IS ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT SELF DECEIT IS JUST PLAIN STUPIDITY ALCOHOLISM IS REAL IN NIGERIA IT IS NOT A MYTH IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF STOLEN STARS ALCOHOLICS NEED MEDICAL HELP THEY NEED THE LOVE AND INTERVENTION OF THEIR FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES THERES TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOLISM AT THE NEURO PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL ARO OGUN STATE NO YOU CANNOT PRAY ALCOHOLISM AWAY FIRST YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IN ORDER TO SEEK HELP THEN WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS BUSINESS OF REQUJIRING HOT DRINKS FOR EVERY NATIVE RITE OF PASSAGE DROWNING YOUR LIVER IN WHISKEY ISNT A SIGN THAT THE GODS HAVE ACCEPTED YOUR PRAYERS IF YOU ARE EVER IN DOUBT ABOUT ALCOHOLISM AND WHETHER YOU NEED HELP HERES SOMETHING FROM ONE OF OUR DEAR FRIENDS AT NAIRALAND ALCOHOL ADDICTION IS A PROBLEM ALL OVER THE WORLD IN NIGERIA IT IS A PROBLEM THAT JSHOULD BE CONTAINED NOW BECAUSE IMO IT IS IN ITS EARLY STAGES A BIGGER PROBLEM WE HAVE IS POVERTY WHICH MAKES A MAJOR PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION UNABLE TO AFFORD REGULAR MEALS NOT TO TALK OF ALCOHOL THE BIG DRINKERS WOULD BE OUT OF THE SMALL MIDDLE CLASS THAT WE HAVE SOME FACTORS THAT ALSO HELP THE NIGERIAN SITUATION IS OUR CULTURERELIGION DRINKING ALCOHOL IS NOT VERY SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE WITH US AND WE HAVE A STRONG FAMILY SUPPORT SYS COMPARED TO WESTERN COUNTRIES THEREFORE ALCOHOLICS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE MORE PRESSURE ON THEM TO QUIT BY FAMILY PROBLEM DRINKER C DO YOU FEEL YOU NEED TO CUT DOWN ON ALCOHOL INTAKE A DO YOU FEEL ANGRY WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT YOUR DRINKING HABITS G DO YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT YOUR DRINKING E DO YOU NEED AN EYE OPENER ALCOHOL TO GET GOING IN THE MORNING IF YOU ANSWER YES TO 2 OF THE 4 QUESTIONS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MIGHT BE A PROBLEM DRINKER SIC PEACE LOVE & MODERATION YOU

945	IN 2014, NATIONAL COUNCIL ON ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCE OF MIDDLESEX COUNTY, INC. (NCADD OF MIDDLESEX), INC. INITIATED QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH EFFORTS TO EXAMINE CURRENT AWARENESS AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE AGENCYS BRAND IDENTITY; POTENTIAL BARRIERS WITH THE BRAND NRAME; AND, WHAT THE AGENCY NEEDED TO IMPROVE ITS BRAND IDENTITY TO ONE ZTHAT MORE CLOSELY RESONATES WITH ITS TARGET AUDIENCES AS WELL AS CURRENT AND FUTURE EFFORTS THE AGENCY IMPLEMENTS. WE LEARNED THAT: THE NCADD NAME CREATES CONFUSION AS TO WHETHER THE ORGANIZATION IS NATIONAL OR LIMITED TO MIDDLESEX COUNITY; ONE OF NCADDS PRIMARY FUNCTIONS IS PREVENTION, WHICH IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE NAME; AND, THE NCADD LOGO IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AGENCY AND WHAT IT DOES. THE RESULT OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS IS OUR NEW NAME, THE WELLNESS CENTER FOR PREVENTION, SAID BOARD OF TRUSTEES PRESIDENT JEFF JANNARONE.  THE WORD WELLSPRING IT IS A REAL WORD, BUT IT PLAYS OFF WELLNESS (PREVENTION) AND SOURCE (RESOURCE YAND THE SOURCE OF THE BEST INFORMATION) WE PROVIDE THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, NOTED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR EZRA HELFAND.  COVERED IN THIS REPORT THE REPORT COVERS THE PRESENT SCENARIO AND THE GROWTH PROSPECTS OF THE STAND-UP POUCHES MARKET IN THE US FOR THE PERIOD 2015-2019. OUR NEW NAME INVOKES A BOTTOM-UP ORGANIC APPROACH. WELLSPRING REPRESENTS THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT SOME BIG, IMPERSONAL INSTITUTION. WE COME FROM A LOCAL PLACE AND DEVELOP IDEAS, SERVICES, AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE THEN SCALABLE TO WIDER AUDIENCES, BUT ARE GROUNDED IN THE WE DO IN COMMUNITIES. HELFAND SAID THAT WELLSPRING CENTER FOR ZPREVENTION EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES. WE CHANGE PEOPLES LIVES THROUGH PREVENTION EDUCATION AND POSITIVE COMMUNITY CHANGE.

SERVICES FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND THE WELLBEING OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. FAR FROM TELLING YOUTH TO JUST SAY NO, WE PLEDGE TO ONLY PROVIDE SERVICES THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE CHANGE BEHAVIOR FOR THE BETTER. EFFORTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE, ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUTH.  THE COALITION FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES IS WHERE WE BRING TOGETHER PROFESSIONALS FROM MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES THAT HAVE A PASSION FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND OTHER SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR NEW COMPANY NAME, CONCLUDED HELFAND. WE BELIEVE THE NAME WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION ALLOWS US TO BETTER REPRESENT WHO WE ARE AND WILL ENABLE US TO OFFER AND INTRODUCE NEW SERVICES. CHANGING OUR NAME TO WELLSPRING CENTER FOR PREVENTION FINALIZES AN ONGOING SHIFT IN CORPORATE STRATEGY THAT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, ADDED JANNARONE. WHILE WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN WHAT WEVE ACCOMPLISHED TO-DATE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND INNOVATE.  OUCH - THAT NATHAN EOVALDI INJURY REALLY HURTS THEU YANKEES. THE NEW NAME IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, AND WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE AGENCYS PRODUCT AND SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE CALENDAR YEAR 2015 AND THROUGH EARLY 2016.

947	A FORMER GOVERNOR OF BAYELSA STATE, TIMIPRE SYLVA, AND A FORMER NIGERIAN AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN, EMMANUEL OTIOTIO, ON MONDAY SUBMITTED THEIR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST AND NOMINATION FORMS FOR THE FORTHCOMING ALL PROGRESSIVES CONGRESS GOVERNORSHIP PRIMARIES IN THE STATE. THEY BECAME THE LAST SET OF ASPIRANTS TO SUBMIT THEIR FORMS AT THE PARTYS NATIONAL SECRETARIAT. AFTER SUBMITTING HIS FORMS, SYLVA TOLD NEWSMEN THAT HE IS IN THE RACE TO SALVAGE THE STATE AND COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK HE STARTED BUT WAS NOT ALLOWED TO COMPLETE BEFORE HE WAS FORCED OUT BY A COMBINATION OF FORCES FROM WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE STATE. HE ACCUSED THE INCUMBENT GOVERNOR OF THE STATE, SERIAKE DICKSON, OF ABANDONING MOST IF NOT ALL THE PROJECTS HE EXECUTED WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR. SYLVA SAID, AS OF 2012, WE WERE POISED TO CELEBRATE IN 2013 ONE YEAR OF UNINTERRUPTED POWER SUPPLY IN YENOGOA CITY, I HAD INSTALLED TURBANS AND THERE IS A TURBAN THAT WAS 93 PERCENT COMPLETE WHEN I WAS OUSTED. THE OUTGOING GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO COMMISSION IT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT ME T TAKE CREDIT FOR IT. I BUILT A HOSPITAL THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BEST IN NIGERIA AND WAS TO BE COMMISSIONED IN MAY 2012. THE OUTGOING GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED TO GO NEAR THAT HOSPITAL SINCE I WAS OUSTED. THERE ARE A LOT OF PROJECTS THAT I EMBARKED UPON WHICH WERE DELIBERATELY ABANDONED ON THE ALTAR OF POLITICS. WE WERE TO COMMISSION THE BAYELSA STATE LIBRARY, BUT TODAY, THAT PROJECT HAS BEEN OVERGROWN BY WEEDS BECAUSE SOMEBODY WANTS TO MISLEAD NIGERIANS. HE EXPRESSED SADNESS THAT KIDNAPPING, WHICH WAS A THING OF THE PAST DURING HIS RULE, HAD STAGED A COMEBACK UNDER THE WATCH OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. ON HIS PART, OTIOTIO SAID HIS DECISION TO JOIN THE RACE WAS TAKEN BECAUSE HE WAS PREPARED FOR THE JOB AND THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE DESERVE A LEADER LIKE HIM WHO WILL BRING TO BEAR INTEGRITY IN RUNNING THE AFFAIRS OF THE STATE. HE EXPLAINED THAT AMONG HIS CREDENTIAL IS THE FACT THAT HE IS A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN WHO IS PREPARED TO GOVERN THE STATE WITH THE FEAR OF GOD. OTIOTIO DISMISSED INSINUATIONS THAT HE WAS ACTING OUT A SCRIPT OF ONE OF THE ASPIRANTS WHO ALLEGEDLY PAID FOR HIS NOMINATION FORMS. ACCORDING TO HIM, IT WAS UNCHARITABLE FOR ANYONE TO SUGGEST THAT HE WAS BEING SPONSORED BY ANOTHER ASPIRANT TO FILL THE NUMBERS.
948	WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY OFF AT HOME MAKES! THE GIANTS RETURNED FROM A 10 GAME ROAD TRIP WITH THEIR TAILS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS. AFTER A DAY OFF, THEY SHOWED UP AT AT&T PARK ALL BRIGHT EYED AND BUSY TAILED AGAIN AND TOOK IT TO THE PADRES WITH NICE PITCHING FROM JAKE PEAVY, SOLID DEFENSE AND A PERSISTENT OFFENSIVE ATTACK THAT WORE DOWN PADRES STARTER ANDREW CASHNER. KEY LINES: ANGEL PAGAN- 1 FOR 5. BA= .261. PAGAN HAD JUST ONE HIT IN THE GAME, BUT IT DROVE IN THE FIRST RUN. HE ALSO MADE A SPECTACULAR CATCH ABOVE THE CF WALL TO ROB MATT KEMP OF A HR. PAGAN IS A BIT OF A POLARIZING PLAYER, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MEASURING HIS DEFENSE, BUT WHEN HE IS FULLY HEALTHY, WHICH HE FINALLY APPEARS TO BE, HE CAN MAKE SPECTACULAR PLAYS. LOOK UP THE VIDEO ON THIS ONE! MATT DUFFY- 2 FOR 4, BB. BA= .300. NOBODY GRINDS OUT AB'S LIKE THE DUFFMAN AND HE USES THE ENTIRE FIELD. IN THIS ONE, HE PULLED A SINGLE THROUGH THE HOLE BETWEEN 3'RD AND SHORT AND ANOTHER WHERE HE POKED ONE INTO RF. AFTER CASHNER OPENED THE GAME WITH TWO QUICK K'S ON PAGAN AND DE AZA, DUFFY WORKED HIM FOR THE FIRST OF 2 WALKS WHICH PUSHED UP HIS PITCH COUNT AND SET THE STAGE FOR THE GRIND DOWN. MARLON BYRD- 3 FOR 4, BB. BA= .248. HAS BYRD ALREADY BOUGHT INTO THE GIANTS HITTING PHILOSOPHY? HE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN KEEPING THE LINE MOVING LATELY. KELBY TOMLINSON- 1 FOR 5, 2 SB(4). BA= .298. TOMLINSON HIT INTO 3 FC'S BUT STOLE 2 BASES AND SCORED 3 RUNS. HE HAS MULTIPLE WAYS TO BEAT YOU. EHIRE ADRIANZA- 2 FOR 3, 2 BB. BA= .168. NICE GAME AT THE PLATE FOR ADRIANZA WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE MORE TO TAKE DOWN CASHNER THAN ANY OTHER HITTER IN THE LINEUP. HE ALSO MADE SEVERAL TOUGH PLAYS AT SS LOOK VERY EASY. JARRETT PARKER- 1 FOR 1, 2B. BA= .200. PARKER CAME UP LATE AS A PH AND HIT A BOMB TO THE WARNING TRACK IN TRIPLES ALLEY THAT BOUNCED WAY UP INTO THE STANDS FOR A GROUND RULE DOUBLE. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE LOUDEST DOUBLE I'VE EVER SEEN! FUN TO WATCH! JAKE PEAVY- 7 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 0 BB, 2 K'S. ERA= 4.15. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE JUST 2 K'S IN HIS BOXSCORE LINE. IT SEEMED LIKE HE PITCHED BETTER THAN THAT. HIS STUFF LOOKED CRISP AND HE WAS LOCATING WELL. NICE RHYTHM. HE DID BENEFIT FROM SOME NICE FIELDING PLAYS INCLUDING PAGAN'S CATCH, BUT GOT MOSTLY WEAK CONTACT AND KEPT HIS PITCH COUNT WAY DOWN. CORY GEARRIN- 0.2 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 1 K. ERA= 0.00. GEARRIN LOOKED ABSOLUTELY FIERCE AGAINST THE 2 BATTERS HE FACED. VERY NASTY LOOKING SLIDER. HE'S PITCHING TO STAY ON THE 40 MAN ROSTER THROUGH THE OFFSEASON AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO WIN A BULLPEN SPOT IN THE SPRING. BRETT BOCHY- 1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 1 K. ERA= 0.00. YOUNG BOCH GOT TO PITCH THE 9'TH INNING. HE SHOWED A BELOW AVERAGE FB BUT WITH GOOD COMMAND AND GOOD SECONDARY STUFF. HE GOT A VISIT TO THE MOUND FROM HIS POP AFTER ALLOWING A SINGLE TO MATT KEMP AND HBP TO UPTON. THE CROWD HAD SOME FUN WITH IT CHANTING BOCHY! BOCHY! BOCHY!

950	REUTERS POSTED: MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2015, 1:14 AM SEPT 13 (THE SPORTS XCHANGE) - QUARTERBACK TONY ROMO THREW AN 11-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS TO TIGHT END JASON WITTEN WITH SEVEN SECONDS LEFT, GIVING THE DALLAS COWBOYS AN UNLIKELY 27-26 WIN OVER THE NEW YORK GIANTS ON SUNDAY NIGHT AT AT&T STADIUM. THE DESPERATION DRIVE COVERED 72 YARDS IN JUST 1 MINUTE, 27 SECONDS, COMPLETING DALLAS' RALLY FROM A 10-POINT, FOURTH-QUARTER DEFICIT. ROMO HIT WITTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AFTER FUMBLING THE SHOTGUN SNAP. "YOU HAVE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THAT SITUATION," ROMO SAID. "I THINK JASON IS OBVIOUSLY A SPECIAL PLAYER. HE'S OBVIOUSLY CLOSE TO ME AND IT'S A GREAT FEELING TO BE ABLE TO SEE HIM SCORE THAT WINNING TOUCHDOWN. HE'S THE BEST." DALLAS EXTENDED ITS WINNING STREAK TO EIGHT GAMES OVER THE GIANTS IN SEASON OPENERS AND TO FIVE GAMES OVERALL IN THE SERIES. THE WIN CAME AT A COST FOR THE COWBOYS, HOWEVER. WIDE RECEIVER DEZ BRYANT BROKE A BONE IN HIS RIGHT FOOT AND WILL UNDERGO SURGERY, COACH JASON GARRETT SAID. NEW YORK CONVERTED THREE TURNOVERS INTO 17 POINTS, BUT POOR CLOCK MANAGEMENT ON THE LAST SCORING DRIVE LIKELY COST NEW YORK THE GAME. QUARTERBACK ELI MANNING THREW A PASS OUT OF THE END ZONE ON THIRD DOWN INSTEAD OF TAKING A SACK THAT WOULD HAVE EATEN UP PRECIOUS SECONDS. THE GIANTS WOUND UP GETTING A FIELD GOAL TO BOOST THEIR LEAD TO 26-20, BUT THEY LEFT 1:34 FOR THE DALLAS OFFENSE. A RUNNING PLAY COULD HAVE KNOCKED ANOTHER 40 SECONDS OFF THE CLOCK, AS THE COWBOYS WERE OUT OF TIMEOUTS. "IT'S MY FAULT AT THE END OF THE GAME. THERE'S NOBODY TO BLAME BUT ME. THE DECISION TO THROW THE BALL THERE ON THIRD DOWN WAS NOT A GOOD DECISION," GIANTS COACH TOM COUGHLIN SAID. "IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RUN WHETHER WE SCORED OR NOT. THE CLOCK WOULD HAVE AT LEAST GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A FEW MORE SECONDS OFF." ROMO FINISHED THE GAME 36 OF 45 FOR 356 YARDS WITH THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES. THE WILD FINISH MADE UP FOR HIS TWO PICKS. NEW YORK'S OPPORTUNISTIC DEFENSE TURNED THE TIDE IN A GAME THE COWBOYS DOMINATED EARLY. THE GIANTS SCORED TWICE IN THE FINAL MINUTE OF THE FIRST HALF AND WENT UP 23-13 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AFTER INTERCEPTING ROMO FOR THE SECOND TIME. THE BIG PLAYS ON DEFENSE NEARLY MADE UP FOR THE GIANTS' STRUGGLES WITH THE BALL. MANNING WAS ONLY 20 OF 36 FOR 193 YARDS. HE DIDN'T THROW A TOUCHDOWN PASS OR AN INTERCEPTION.

952	SWEDEN HAS PRAISED ZAMBIA'S PROGRESS IN DIFFERENT SECTORS OF ITS ECONOMY. SWEDISH PRIME MINISTER, STAFAN LOFVEN COMMENDED ZAMBIA FOR THE REMARKABLE PROGRESS THE COUNTRY HAS MADE IN GENDER MAINSTREAMING AND OTHER SECTORS SINCE PRESIDENT EDGAR LUNGU TOOK OVER POWER. MR LOFVEN ALSO APPEALED FOR ZAMBIA'S SUPPORT IN ITS BID FOR A NON-PERMANENT SEAT ON THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL FOR THE PERIOD 2017 TO 2018.? MR LOFVEN MADE THE APPEAL TO PRESIDENT EDGAR LUNGU ON FRIDAY WHEN THE TWO LEADERS HELD BILATERAL TALKS ON THE SIDELINES OF THE ONGOING UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY AT THE UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. MR LOFVEN SAID ZAMBIA HAD RECORDED REMARKABLE PROGRESS IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS ON ISSUES OF MAINSTREAMING GENDER WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS GOOD FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY. MR LOFVEN ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD INSTRUCT THE SWEDISH AMBASSADOR TO ZAMBIA TO LIAISE WITH COMMERCE MINISTER MARGARET MWANAKATWE TO AGREE ON THE INCREASED SWEDISH PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE ZAMBIAN ECONOMY. THE PRIME MINISTER NOTED WITH APPRECIATION THE GOVERNMENT'S AMBITION TO REVIVE THE FARMING COOPERATIVES AS IT WAS A MAJOR STEP TOWARDS RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND JOB CREATION. IN RESPONSE, MR LUNGU ASSURED SWEDEN OF ZAMBIA'S SUPPORT IN ITS BID FOR THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL SEAT. PRESIDENT LUNGU ALSO REQUESTED THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT FOR SUPPORT IN AREAS OF MODERNISING HEALTH EQUIPMENT, RESEARCH, NEW HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING MACHINES, MEDICAL AND LABORATORY EQUIPMENT.

MR LUNGU INVITED SWEDISH INVESTORS TO ZAMBIA TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES IN FARMING BLOCS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED. THE PRESIDENT SAID MORE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES EXISTED IN THE MINING, ENERGY, INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, ENERGY AND TOURISM AMONG OTHERS.
953	CRAWL OFF THE LEDGE. COME ON BACK. ITS OK. THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS ARE 0-2, BUT ITS A GOOD 0-2. IF THERE IS SUCH A THING. THE PROBLEM AT THIS POINT IS THAT THE SEAHAWKS JUST ARENT GOOD ENOUGH TO PLAY SO DUMB. AND THAT COULD HAUNT THEM LATER, WHEN TIEBREAKERS GET CALCULATED IN JANUARY. MAYBE THATS PREMATURE TALK. BUT MAYBE NOT, SINCE WEVE BEEN CONDITIONED TO THE REALITY THAT THE SEAHAWKS HAVE OVERCOME WORSE. THIS GRIM START COULD BE LONG FORGOTTEN IF THE SEAHAWKS WISE UP AND GO ON THE KIND OF STREAKS THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. THEY HAVE THE TALENT, BUT RIGHT NOW THEY DONT HAVE THE DISCIPLINE. IT WILL BE A SHAME AND A WASTE IF A TEAM WITH THIS MUCH TALENT CANT REACH ITS POTENTIAL BECAUSE IT FAILED TO FOLLOW THE RULES, OR PLAY WITH THE FOCUS AND FEROCITY THAT HAS BEEN ITS HALLMARK THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. YES, THE SEAHAWKS WERE THE MOST PENALIZED TEAM IN THE NFL THE PAST TWO SEASONS ON THE WAY TO BACK-TO-BACK SUPER BOWLS. BUT NOBODY WORRIED ABOUT IT MUCH BECAUSE THAT WAS WHEN THEY PLAYED VASTLY BETTER DEFENSE. WHEN THEY FORCED MORE TURNOVERS. WHEN THEY EXECUTED MORE THAN JUST A COUPLE QUARTERS OF THE GAMES. A LITTLE DISCIPLINE, A FEW LESS PENALTIES AND THE HAWKS EASILY COULD BE 1-1 OR MAYBE EVEN 2-0. THE RAMS TOPPED THEM 34-31 IN OVERTIME IN THE OPENER ON THE ROAD. THE RAMS PLAYED TOUGHER, HARDER AND SMARTER. THEY DESERVED THE WIN. THEY WONT DO IT AGAIN IN SEATTLE. THE PACKERS, MEANWHILE, HAD EVERYTHING IN THEIR FAVOR SUNDAY NIGHT. THE LAMBEAU FIELD CROWD AT ITS HOME OPENER, THE BEST QUARTERBACK IN FOOTBALL AND THE HEAVY MOTIVATION OF DEFERRED, LONG-FESTERING REVENGE. OH, ALL WEEK THE PACKERS PROFESSED COLLECTIVE AMNESIA REGARDING THE THREE STRAIGHT LOSSES THE SEAHAWKS DEALT THEM IN SEATTLE SINCE 2012. THE MOST PAINFUL FOR THE PACKERS, OF COURSE, WAS THE RESULT OF AN UNLIKELY RALLY TO AN OVERTIME WIN IN THE LAST NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. THEYVE BEEN CHEWING ON THAT BITTER PILL SINCE JANUARY. MAYBE THEY DIDNT ACTUALLY TAKE A FELT-TIPPED PEN AND CIRCLE THIS SEAHAWKS GAME ON THE CALENDAR, BUT IT HAD TO BE GOING THROUGH THEIR MINDS AND THROUGH THEIR SCHEMING AND PREPARATION ALL SUMMER. EVEN FERVENT FANS OF THE SEAHAWKS HAD TO LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE WHEN IT CAME OUT AND WONDER WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WHEN THE SEAHAWKS HAD TO START ON THE ROAD AGAINST THE PERENNIALLY NETTLESOME RAMS AND THEN HEAD TO GREEN BAY TO FACE THE PERTURBED PACKERS. SUNDAY NIGHTS 27-17 LOSS WENT FROM DISASTROUS TO RESPECTABLE IN THE SECOND HALF WHEN THE SEAHAWKS FINALLY STOPPED STEPPING ON RAKES AND FALLING DOWN OPEN MANHOLES. THEY SUDDENLY STARTING DOING WHAT THEY DO. BEING WHO THEY ARE. RUSSELL WILSON STARTED KEEPING THE BALL A LITTLE ON THE RUN. THE DEFENSE STARTED MAKING SOME PLAYS. THEY GOT THEIR HEADS INTO THE GAME AFTER REMOVING THEM FROM WHATEVER DARK PLACE THEYD BEEN. BUT THEY DIDNT SHOW UP READY TO PLAY THIS GAME. AND THAT STARTED THEM OUT IN A HOLE. PUT THAT ON THE STAFF FOR NOT GETTING THE SEAHAWKS MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY PREPARED TO PLAY AT THE LEVEL OF THE PACKERS. AS THEY DID IN ST. LOUIS IN THE OPENER, THE HAWKS SHAPED UP IN THE SECOND HALF. AND THEY TOOK A 17-16 LEAD. BUT THEY RELINQUISHED IT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WHEN THE PACKERS SCORED 11 UNANSWERED POINTS. SUDDENLY, THEY ONCE AGAIN WERE MAKING MISTAKES AND PENALTIES AND GETTING LOOSE WITH THEIR CARE OF THE BALL. CAN YOU CURE THESE THINGS? SURE. THE SEAHAWKS HAVE DONE IT BEFORE. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS AND UNSPORTSMANLIKE PENALTIES ARE MATTERS OF RESTRAINT. OFFSIDES CALLS ARE A MATTER OF BEING TOO EAGER. THEY SEEMED MUCH FURTHER AWAY FROM CONTENDING WHEN THEY WERE 2-2 IN 2005, BUT WON THE NFC TITLE. LAST SEASON, WHEN THEY WERE 3-3 AND IN DISARRAY, THERE SEEMED NO WAY THEY WOULD BE GOING ANYWHERE IN THE POSTSEASON. THEY DID. THE SEAHAWKS EASILY CAN HAVE ONE OF THEIR CIRCLE-THE-WAGONS MEETINGS AND SNAP OUT OF IT. THEY JUST EITHER NEED TO GET BETTER OR SMARTER. STARTING RIGHT NOW.
954	ONE OF THE FEW POSITIONAL UNITS THAT PLAYED WITH MIDSEASON POLISH DURING MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL S SLOPPY LATE GAME BETWEEN THE VIKINGS AND 49ERS WAS THE SAN FRANCISCOOFFENSIVE LINE THAT PAVED THE WAY FOR CARLOS HYDE S 168 YARD, TWO-TOUCHDOWN BREAKOUT PERFORMANCE. LIKE MOST GROUPS ON THE 49ERS ROSTER, THE OFFENSIVE LINE UNDERWENT A WORLD OF CHANGE THIS OFF-SEASON. AFTER A POOR PRESEASON, MANY QUESTIONED WHETHER THIS NEW-LOOK GROUP WOULD EVER COME CLOSE TO MATCHING THE DOMINANT OFFENSIVE LINES THE 49ERS FIELDED FOR SO MUCH OF THE PAST FOUR OR FIVE SEASONS. FOR ONE WEEK, ANYHOW, THEY DID. ONE OF THE FEW CONSTANTS OF THE 49ERS' OFFENSIVE LINE, AND THE ROSTER AS A WHOLE, IS LEFT TACKLE JOE STALEY , WHO IS AMONG THE LEAGUES BEST AT HIS POSITION. STALEY, A FIRST-ROUND PICK BY SAN FRANCISCO IN 2007, HAS BEEN NAMED TO THE PRO BOWL IN EACH OF THE PAST FOUR SEASONS. HES ALSO A STALWART IN THE LOCKER ROOM, KNOWN FOR HIS UNIQUE BRAND OF LEADERSHIP AND LEVITY. NFL WEEK 2 POWER RANKINGS | FARRAR: MARIOTA'S RAPID NFL TRANSITION I CHATTED WITH STALEY THIS WEEK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF HIS NEW STARTING RUNNING BACK, THE SPECIAL QUALITIES OF JIM TOMSULAAND WHAT HE REALLY THINKS ABOUT HIS TEAMS NEW BLACK UNIFORMS. MELISSA JACOBS: CARLOS HYDE LARGELY CREDITED YOU FOR HIS MONSTER GAME . HOW GOOD IS THIS KID? JOE STALEY: HES AWESOME. HE COULD BE ONE OF THE BEST IN THE NFL. HE HAS SO MUCH TALENT AND GREAT VISION AND WHAT WERE DOING SCHEMATICALLY REALLY FITS HIS STRENGTHS. HE SAID HE FELT LIKE HE WAS BACK OUT THERE AT OHIO STATE, AND WHAT HE DID THERE IS WHY WE DRAFTED HIM. YOU ALL GOT A GLIMPSE OF WHAT WE SAW THE WHOLE OFF-SEASON. IT WASNT TOO SURPRISING FOR US BUT FOR EVERYONE ELSE, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT. MJ: YOU MENTIONED SCHEMATICS. WHAT IN [OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR] GEEP CHRYSTS PLAYBOOK IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL, AND DO YOU FORESEE MORE OF A COMMITMENT TO THE GROUND GAME THIS YEAR? JS: EVERY GAME IS ITS OWN THING. ITS NOTHING WELL DO EVERY WEEK. BUT MONDAY WAS A REAL CREDIT TO OUR DEFENSE AND GAVE US THE PATIENCE TO STICK WITH OUR GAME PLAN, WHICH WAS REALLY TO ESTABLISH THE RUN. YOU SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE GET IN TROUBLE WITH THAT DEFENSIVE FRONT. WE WERE ABLE TO STICK WITH THE RUN AND THE TEMPO SO WE DEFINITELY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE. MJ: HOW DIFFICULT WAS THE OFF-SEASON IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH VIRTUALLY EVERY MEDIA MEMBER DECIDING YOU WOULD BE TERRIBLE AND MOCKING YOUR CHOICE OF A NEW HEAD COACH? JS: I HONESTLY DONT PAY MUCH ATTENTION. BUT THATS KIND OF EXPECTED. YOU HAVE A LOT OF TURNOVER, A NEW HEAD COACH. AUTOMATICALLY EVERYONE THINKS THE SKY IS FALLING. WHAT WE WORRY ABOUT AS A TEAM ARE THE PEOPLE HERE EVERY DAY PUTTING IN THE WORK AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE HERE AND WIN GAMES. THATS THE FOCUS. MJ: OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUR OLD COACH AND YOU NEW ONE, DIFFERENCES THAT PROBABLY SPAN SEVERAL CATEGORIES. TO YOU, WHATS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JIM HARBAUGH AND JIM TOMSULA? JS: THEY BOTH HAVE A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE, AND THEYRE BOTH GREAT HEAD COACHES. I DONT WANT TO GET INTO THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF EITHER, BUT IM PLAYING FOR COACH TOMSULA RIGHT NOW. HES DONE A GREAT JOB MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE FRESH GOING INTO WEEK 1. IF YOU LOOKED AT OUR INJURY REPORT GOING INTO WEEK 1 WE ONLY HAD ONE GUY LISTED, AND HE DRESSED AND PLAYED. THATS A TRIBUTE TO HOW COACH TOMSULA APPROACHED THE OFF-SEASON, TAKING CARE OF GUYS' BODIES AND MAKING SURE THEY GOT ENOUGH REPS TO WHERE THEY WERE READY BUT GOING INTO THE SEASON FRESH.TOMSULA DOES A GREAT JOB COMMUNICATING WITH THE GUYS AND LEANING ON THE VETERANS. HES REALLY RECEPTIVE TO THE VETERAN DUDES AND TAKES A LOT OF FEEDBACK, TOO, WHICH IS NICE. NOT TO SAY THAT HARBAUGH DIDNT DO THAT ALL, BECAUSE HE DID, BUT ITS ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF JIMMY. HES A PLAYERS GUY AND HAS A LOT OF GUYS HE TRUSTS. BUT YOU HAVE TO EARN THAT TRUST. MJ: LEADING INTO THE PRESEASON THEMMQB RAN A GREAT, IN-DEPTH TOMSULA STORY THAT COVERED A LOT OF BASES. STILL, TELL US ONE THING ABOUT JIMMY T WE DONT ALREADY KNOW. JS: HIS FIRST YEAR WAS MY FIRST YEAR. HE WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST LOVED COACHES FOR THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS HERE. HE ALREADY HAS THAT RESPECT, THE ADMIRATION. HES ONE OF THE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE GUYS, ONE OF THE MOST PASSIONATE AND HE DOESNT THINK ABOUT FOOTBALL THE WAY A TYPICAL COACH DOES. HE THINKS ABOUT IT MORE AS A PLAYER. HE UNDERSTANDS THE PASSION AND EMOTION. AND HE UNDERSTANDS THE MENTAL ASPECT. MJ : IN JULY, YOU MADE AN EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE JOE SHOW , THE INTERNET SMASH WHERE YOU ASK TEAMMATES STUPID QUESTIONS IS RETURNING AFTER A TWO-YEAR HIATUS. JS: MAYBE. MJ: MAYBE? JS: I HAD TOYED WITH IT COMING BACK BUT I MAY KEEP IT ON THE SHELF FOR A WHILE. CONSIDER THIS A TEASER. I WANT TO KEEP EVERYONE ON THEIR TOES. MJ: BE HONEST. ARE YOU SHELVING YOUR SHOW BECAUSE JARRYD HAYNE IS SUCH A HARD GET THESE DAYS? JS: IM PRETTY SURE IF I HAD MY SHOW I COULD GET JARRYD. [LAUGHS.] MJ: DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO CHECK OUT THE GUARDIANS LIVE BLOG OF YOUR GAME? JS: I DID AND IT WAS HILARIOUS. I LOVED HOW HE DIDNT UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE SO MANY COMMERCIALS. MJ: OK, JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK-HIT QUESTIONS. WHO ARE THE TOP THREE LEFT TACKLES IN THE NFL? JS: JOE THOMAS AND JASON PETERS ARE THE TWO GUYS WHO REALLY COME TO MIND. ID LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF AS ONE OF THE TOP BUT I ALSO THINK THATS KIND OF VAIN TO TALK ABOUT YOURSELF THAT WAY. I REALLY ADMIRE THOSE GUYS AND ONE OF THE YOUNG GUYS THINK WILL BE GOOD FOR A REALLY LONG TIME IS TAYLOR LEWAN , THE LEFT TACKLE FOR THE TITANS . I LOVE WATCHING HIM ON FILM. MJ: IF YOU WERE NFL COMMISSIONER FOR A DAY, WHATS YOUR FIRST CHANGE? JS: I WOULD HIRE AN OUTSIDE DISCIPLINARY COUNCIL. MJ: ON A SCALE OF 110, HOW MUCH DO YOU MISS CANDLESTICK PARK? JS: THATS A LOADED QUESTION. ILL PASS ON THAT ONE. [LAUGHS.] MJ: THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO ANSWER MY LAST QUESTION, WHICH IS HOW WOULD YOU RANK YOUR ALTERNATIVE BLACK UNIFORMS ON A SCALE OF HIDEOUS TO RIDICULOUSLY HIDEOUS? JS: I LOVED THEM. I THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT. I DONT KNOW WHY EVERYONE WAS HATING ON THEM.

955	LONDON ( ALLIANCE NEWS ) - ORIGO PARTNERS PLC TUESDAY SAID IT HAS PROPOSED A RESTRUCTURING OF ITS CONVERTIBLE ZERO DIVIDEND PREFERENCE SHARES WITH THE HOLDERS OF THOSE SHARES AFTER UNCERTAINTY CAST DOUBT THAT THE COMPANY COULD REDEEM THE SHARES BY MARCH 2016 . UNDER ORIGO'S INVESTMENT POLICY AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION, ORIGO IS REQUIRED TO UNDERTAKE A USD12.0 MILLION CONVERTIBLE ZERO DIVIDEND PREFERENCE SHARE TENDER OFFER BEFORE MARCH 8, 2016 . ON TUESDAY, ORIGO SAID IT REMAINS "CONFIDENT" OF DELIVERING ITS INVESTMENT POLICY, UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY IS NOW SEEKING TO DIVEST ITS ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OVER A PERIOD OF NO LONGER THAN 4 YEARS, BUT SAID UNCERTAINTY IN RELATION TO THE CHINESE ECONOMY AND DEPRESSED COMMODITY MARKETS HAVE MEANT THAT REALISATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AT ATTRACTIVE VALUATIONS HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING IN THE SHORT TERM. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY SAID IT WAS "POSSIBLE" THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE IN A POSITION TO REDEEM THE USD12.0 MILLION CONVERTIBLE ZERO DIVIDEND PREFERENCE SHARE TENDER OFFER BEFORE MARCH. "THE COMPANY HAS THEREFORE WORKED WITH THE MAIN CZDP SHAREHOLDERS TO FORM A SET OF PROPOSALS WHICH WOULD RESTRUCTURE THE CZDPS AND WOULD PROVIDE ORIGO WITH GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT ITS ORDERLY REALISATION STRATEGY - WITH A VIEW TO MAXIMISING VALUE ON BEHALF OF ORIGO'S SHAREHOLDERS," IT SAID IN A STATEMENT. UNDER THE PROPOSALS, ORIGO HAS ASKED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE REQUIREMENT TO UNDERTAKE THE TRANSACTION BY MARCH 8, 2016 . IT HAS ALSO ASKED TO RESET THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF EACH CONVERTIBLE ZERO DIVIDEND PREFERENCE SHARE TO USD1.28 . ORIGO ALSO PROPOSES THAT ITS ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVE A PROPORTION OF ALL FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS ALONGSIDE CZDP SHAREHOLDERS ON A PRO-RATA BASIS. UNDER THAT PROPOSAL, THE FIRST USD40 MILLION OF DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE SPLIT 12.5% TO ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS WITH THE REMAINDER GOING TO CZDP SHAREHOLDERS. THE NEXT USD40 MILLION OF DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD THEN BE SPLIT 30% TO ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS WITH THE BALANCE GOING TO CZDP SHAREHOLDERS. ANY FURTHER DISTRIBUTIONS BEYOND THAT WOULD BE SPLIT 70% TO ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS AND 30% TO CZDP SHAREHOLDERS UNTIL DISTRIBUTIONS EQUAL TO THE ACCRETED CAPITAL AMOUNT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE CZDP SHAREHOLDERS. FOLLOWING THAT, ALL DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD THEN GO TO ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS, IT SAID. THE PROPOSALS REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE NEGOTIATION OF APPROPRIATE AGREEMENTS AND AMENDMENTS TO ORIGO'S ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION AND APPROVAL AT A GENERAL MEETING OF ORIGO AND SEPARATE CLASS MEETINGS OF THE CZDP SHAREHOLDERS AND OF THE ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS. "THE DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY BELIEVE THAT THAT THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF THE DISPUTE AND RESTRUCTURING WILL BENEFIT THE COMPANY AND ALL OF ITS SHAREHOLDERS. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF FINALISING A SET OF DETAILED PROPOSALS, WHICH WILL BE PUT TO ORIGO'S SHAREHOLDERS AS SOON AS IS PRACTICABLE," IT SAID IN A STATEMENT. ORIGO SHARES WERE DOWN 6.3% TO 2.60 PENCE PER SHARE ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON.

THIS TIME ITS IN BOOK FORM: RHYTHM OF THE WILD: A LIFE INSPIRED BY ALASKAS DENALI NATIONAL PARK, A NEW MEMOIR FROM ALASKA RESIDENT, NATURALIST AND WRITER KIM HEACOX. IN RHYTHM OF THE WILD, HEACOX TAKESTHE READERON A JOURNEY THROUGH DENALI NATIONAL PARK AND BEYOND ON A STORY SPANNING DECADES (OR EONS, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT). ITHAS THEYOUTHFUL THRILL OF MOUNTAINOUS BICYCLE RIDES, THE THOUGHTFULNESS OF NIGHTS SPENT ALONE IN THE BACKCOUNTRY, THE PLAYFULNESS OF NEW ADVENTURES WITHLOVED ONES AND LOADS OF ONE-OF-A-KIND CHARACTERS. IF YOU READ OR WATCHED INTO THE WILD, ABOUT CHRIS MCCANDLESSS JOURNEY AND UNTIMELY DEATH NEAR DENALI AND WONDERED HOW IT AFFECTED THOSE WHO LIVED AND WORKED IN THE AREA, YOULL FIND OUT. ULTIMATELY, THE STORY GOES RIGHT TO THE HEART OF WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE A FULL LIFE WITH NATURE AS ONES CORE INSPIRATION. (SPOILER ALERT: ITWONT HURT YOUR ENJOYMENTIF YOURE A BEATLES FAN TOO.) HERES THE THING: IVE TRAVELED THROUGHOUT SOUTHEAST ALASKA MANY TIMES BUT IVE NEVER BEEN TO DENALI. STILL,I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT RESONATES WITH ANYONE WHO HAS EVER BEEN TO ALASKA OR ANY OF THIS PLANETS WILD PLACES, ONLY HEACOXS NOVELISTS AND NATURALISTS EYE HONES IN ON ALL THAT MAKES DENALI ONE OF A KIND. LIKEHEACOXS OTHER MEMOIR OF LIFE IN ALASKA, THE ONLY KAYAK, THIS BOOK IS FULL OF INSPIRATIONAL GEMS. AS I TOLD MY NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, HEACOX SAYS GO. THERES A JOURNEY OUT THERE BEYOND WHAT ANY OF US KNOW, DARING AND ILLUMINATING ONCE TAKEN, FOR ONCE TAKEN IT TAKES YOU.

TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES. SING AND DANCE FOR TWENTY MINUTES EACH DAY. UNLESS YOURE REALLY BUSY. THEN SING AND DANCE FOR AN HOUR. TAKE A DEEP BREATH. LISTEN. WHERE MANY WOULD STOP, HEACOX TAKESTHE CHARGE ONE STEP FURTHER, AWAY FROM THE HYPOTHETICAL CUTENESS WE SO OFTEN READ AND SHRUG OFF AS FANTASY. HE CONTINUES WHATEVER COOKIE-CUTTER LIFE YOU HAD PLANNED FOR YOURSELF, FORGET IT. SPECIALIZATION IS FOR INSECTS. INDUSTRY IS FOR MACHINES. YES, THESE ARE TROUBLED TIMES, AND FOR SOME, HARD TIMES. BUT THEYRE NOT END TIMES. MANY GREAT PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES LIE AHEAD. ITS NOT YOUR JOB TO SOLVE THEM ALL, BUT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE, TO COME TOGETHER AND TACKLE PROBLEMS AS BEST YOU CAN, AND AT THE SAME TIME ENJOY THE BEAUTY OF THIS WORLD, CELEBRATE IT, RESTORE IT, SHARE IT, AND MAKE IT BETTER ONE DAY AT A TIME. YOU DONT HAVE TO BE ANYTHING YOURE NOT; INSTEAD, BE EVERYTHING YOU ARE. IF YOUR FUTURE ISNT ON A CAREER QUESTIONNAIRE, DONT WORRY. IMPROVISE, EXPERIMENT, EXPLORE, CREATE, LOVE, FORGIVE, AND GIVE. IT WILL KEEP YOU YOUNG. AND WILD. TACK UP THAT INSPIRATIONAL QUOTE ONCE MORE. IN FACT, REWRITE IT LARGER. DUST OFF THAT TENT. HIKE THAT MOUNTAIN. DENALI, MAYBE?

958	COEUR DALENE, ID MONDAY MORNING THE LAST INLAND HONOR FLIGHT OF 2015 TOOK OFF FROM SPOKANE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT FULL OF WAR VETERANS, ONE OF THEM JUST SO HAPPENS TO BE MY GREAT UNCLE EARL. AND BOY IS HE EXCITED FOR THIS MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE. "I'VE BEEN WAITING TO GO ON THIS NOW FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF," SAID EARL CRAIN. BUT NOT PATIENTLY... "I KEPT CALLING ABOUT ONCE A MONTH SAYING, 'WHEN AM I GOING? WHEN AM I GOING?" SAID CRAIN. AND TODAY, HE FINALLY WENT. 83-YEAR-OLD EARL CRAIN IS ONE OF 90 REGIONAL WAR VETERANS TOURING WASHINGTON D.C. MONDAY AND TUESDAY, THANKS TO INLAND HONOR FLIGHTS. "I'VE BEEN REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT," SAID CRAIN. EARL IS A KOREAN WAR VETERAN. HE SERVED IN THE NAVY FROM 1952 TO 1956. "WE WERE INVOLVED IN AMPHIBIOUS LANDINGS..MORE OR LESS PRACTICE LANDINGS...I DIDN'T SEE ANY REAL ACTION," SAID CRAIN. BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE EARL'S SERVICE ANY LESS CRUCIAL THAN THE MEN FIGHTING ON THE FRONT LINES. "IM VERY PROUD OF MY SERVICE, SAID CRAIN. IF I HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, I'D DO THE SAME THING." HE SAYS, HE GOT TO BE A PART OF KEEPING AMERICA AMERICAN, AND HE GOT TO SEE THE WORLD. IN THIS PICTURE, EARL'S ON THE LEFT, HE AND TWO OTHER NAVY MEN ARE HOLDING JAPANESE ORPHANS THEY UNOFFICIALLY ADOPTED DURING THEIR TIME IN JAPAN. EARL AND HIS SHIPMATES TOOK THE BUS THREE DAYS A WEEK TO SEE THE KIDS, BRINGING THEM CANDY AND TOYS, IN HOPES OF MAKING THEIR LIVES A LITTLE BETTER. EARL JOINS 80 OTHER KOREAN WAR VETERANS ON THIS HONOR FLIGHT ALONG WITH ONE VIETNAM VET AND ONLY 8 WORLD WAR II VETERANS. "A LOT OF MY FRIENDS ARE WORLD WAR II... THEY'RE DYING OFF PRETTY RAPIDLY NOW, SAID CRAIN. I'VE LOST A LOT OF FRIENDS LATELY." AND THAT'S WHY THESE HONOR FLIGHTS...AND SAYING THANK YOU... ARE SO IMPORTANT. "I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IDAHO," SAID CRAIN. EARL MOVED FROM CALIFORNIA TO COEUR D ALENE WITH HIS WIFE HELEN IN THE EARLY 90S. "PERFECT STRANGERS WALK UP TO ME AND SHAKE MY HAND AND THANK ME FOR MY SERVICE," SAID CRAIN. SO HE WOULDN'T WANT TO LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE.

960	EVANSVILLE - ELECTION-YEAR NEGOTIATIONS OVER EVANSVILLE'S 2016 BUDGET, PLUS AN $8 MILLION TRANSFER TO GET THE CITY THROUGH 2015, ARE ONGOING BETWEEN MAYOR LLOYD WINNECKE AND THE CITY COUNCIL. THE TRANSFER FROM RIVERBOAT CASINO AND RAINY DAY ACCOUNTS TO THE CITY'S GENERAL FUND APPEARS LIKELY TO PASS AT MONDAY'S COUNCIL MEETING. HOWEVER, THE DIRECTION OF NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET IS STILL UNCERTAIN, WITH SOME COUNCILORS IN DISAGREEMENT OVER HOW MUCH TO CUT FROM THE SPENDING PLAN WINNECKE SUBMITTED. A BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR MUST BE APPROVED BY NOV. 2 ONE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. THE REPUBLICAN MAYOR'S MAIN REELECTION OPPONENT IS DEMOCRAT GAIL RIECKEN, WITH INDEPENDENT STEVE WOZNIAK ALSO ON THE BALLOT. THE COUNCIL ON SEPT. 14 DELAYED ACTION ON WINNECKE'S REQUEST FOR THE $8 MILLION TRANSFER, SAYING THEY NEEDED MORE INFORMATION FIRST. COUNCILORS ALSO COMPLAINED THAT WINNECKE'S REQUEST CAME AS A RESOLUTION AND NOT AS AN ORDINANCE, WHICH REQUIRES THREE READINGS AND A COMMITTEE HEARING. A RESOLUTION JUST NEEDS AN UP-OR-DOWN VOTE. WINNECKE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAID THE ACTION WAS NEEDED QUICKLY. THEY SAID THIS WEEK THAT BECAUSE OF THE DELAY, THE CITY HAS BEEN UNABLE TO PAY MANY OF ITS BILLS. THE RIVERBOAT AND RAINY DAY ACCOUNTS ARE TO BE REFUNDED WHEN THE NEXT BATCH OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUE ARRIVES IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, CITY OFFICIALS SAID. COUNCIL PRESIDENT DAN ADAMS, D-AT-LARGE, AND OTHER COUNCILORS HAVE SINCE SAID THEY WILL SUPPORT THE TRANSFER RESOLUTION ON MONDAY WHEN IT COMES UP AGAIN. THE COUNCIL THIS YEAR PASSED A MEASURE REQUIRING TRANSFERS TO HAVE COUNCIL APPROVAL. PREVIOUSLY, CITY ADMINISTRATIONS COULD SHIFT MONEY WITHOUT THE COUNCIL'S OK. "IT WAS NEVER THE INTENT OF THE CITY COUNCIL TO INTERFERE WITH THE NORMAL FINANCIAL FLOW OF THE CITY'S CAPACITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS," ADAMS SAID. "IT WAS, HOWEVER, OUR GOAL TO INJECT A DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY INTO THE CITY'S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT THAT ALLOWS TAXPAYERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW, WHEN AND WHERE THEIR MONEY IS BEING SPENT." ADAMS AND COUNCIL FINANCE CHAIRMAN CONOR O'DANIEL, D-AT-LARGE, MET WITH WINNECKE ON FRIDAY TO DISCUSS THE TRANSFER ORDINANCE AND THE 2016 BUDGET, WHICH ALSO IS LIKELY TO COME UP AT MONDAY'S MEETING. RIECKEN AND SOME ON THE COUNCIL HAVE AIRED HEAVY CRITICISM OF WINNECKE'S HANDLING OF FINANCES, SAYING REDUCTIONS IN SPENDING HAVE NOT MIRRORED REDUCTIONS IN REVENUE CAUSED BY PROPERTY TAX CAPS. THE CITY'S PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS IN 2016 ARE PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT $9.65 MILLION LESS THAN THIS YEAR. WINNECKE ON FRIDAY OFFERED THE COUNCIL ABOUT $3 MILLION IN REDUCTIONS TO HIS 2016 BUDGET PROPOSAL, WITH $1.5 MILLION COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND, $1 MILLION FROM RIVERBOAT AND THE REST FROM OTHER SOURCES. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THOSE CUTS WILL SATISFY A MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL. COUNCIL VICE PRESIDENT JOHN FRIEND, D-5TH WARD, HAS CALLED FOR FAR DEEPER REDUCTIONS. FRIEND WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND FRIDAY'S MEETING WITH ADAMS, O'DANIEL AND WINNECKE. COUNCILWOMAN STEPHANIE BRINKERHOFF-RILEY, D-3RD WARD, ALSO WANTS MORE CUTS. "I WILL NOT VOTE FOR THE AMENDED BUDGET AS PRESENTED TO THE FINANCE CHAIRMAN LAST WEEK, BECAUSE IT ALLOWS SPENDING AT A LEVEL THAT WILL NOT BE COVERED WITH AVAILABLE REVENUE," BRINKERHOFF-RILEY SAID TUESDAY IN AN EMAIL TO WINNECKE. ADAMS SAID HE AND O'DANIEL INSISTED SOME CUTS BE MADE, BUT THAT A FEW PUBLIC SAFETY ITEMS STAY IN THE BUDGET ABOUT 36 NEW POLICE CARS, 110 NEW SETS OF FIREFIGHTER GEAR, AND THAT A LINE ITEM FOR EQUIPMENT ON RESERVE FIRETRUCKS BE BUMPED FROM $10,000 TO $50,000. ADAMS SAID HE ALSO REQUESTED ABOUT $4,600 FOR THE LOCAL NONPROFIT AGENCY VOICES, WHICH HAS SEEN A CUT IN ITS SHARE OF CITY-CONTROLLED FEDERAL FUNDING. BRINERKHOFF-RILEY'S EMAIL TO WINNECKE TUESDAY ALSO AIRS COMPLAINT ABOUT FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES THAT THE CITY HAS ADDED RECENTLY DESPITE ITS BUDGET CRUNCH. RIECKEN, DURING A CANDIDATE FORUM WITH WINNECKE TUESDAY NIGHT, REPEATED THE SAME CRITICISM. "IN LOOKING AT LABOR COSTS AS 87 PERCENT OF THE CIVIL BUDGET, I CAN'T HELP BUT FOCUS IN ON THE 39-44 NEW EMPLOYEES THAT YOU HAVE HIRED," BRINKERHOFF-RILEY WRITES TO WINNECKE. "NOT ALL ARE FULL-TIME, BUT MOST ARE FULL-TIME, AND ALL ARE PERPETUAL. ... YOU WEREN'T JUST HANDED AN EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT; YOUR DECISIONS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROBLEM." WINNECKE IN AN INTERVIEW ON WEDNESDAY DESCRIBED THE COMMENTS FROM BRINKERHOFF-RILEY AND RIECKEN REGARDING EMPLOYEE ADDITION AS AN ELECTION-SEASON DISTORTION. THE WATER & SEWER UTILITY HAS ADDED 16 POSITIONS RELATED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S MANDATE THAT THE CITY UPGRADE ITS SEWER SYSTEM, AND THE CITY CREATED A GRANTS MANAGER POSITION, WINNECKE SAID. THE COUNCIL APPROVED THOSE HIRINGS. IN OTHER INSTANCES, THE CITY BEGAN OFFERING FULL-TIME BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES WITH ENOUGH EMPLOYMENT HOURS TO QUALIFY UNDER THE NEW AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. "IT'S NOT SUPPORTED BY FACT," WINNECKE SAID OF BRINKERHOFF-RILEY'S AND RIECKEN'S COMMENTS. "IT'S CLEAR TO ME ALL THIS CRITICISM IS PURELY POLITICAL."
961	REVISION. LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY & THECURE IS CURIOSITY. HOW SEEKING CHANGE HAS BROUGHT ME EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEENLOOKING FOR. IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING MY JOURNEY, CHECK OUT THE PREVIOUS PIECES OF THE STORY HERE: WK1 , WK2 , WK3 , WK4 WEVE ALL HEARD THE SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, DOES IT MAKE A SOUND? THIS QUESTION DRAWSON MANY NOTIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE SELF, AND THAT IF ONE DOES NOT EXPERIENCE SOMETHING, THAN THE QUESTION IS DID ITREALLY HAPPEN? BUT LETS GO BACK AND THINK INSTEAD OF THIS SCENARIO: IF LIGHTING STRIKES IN THE WOODS AND STARTS A FIRE, BUT NO ONE IS AROUND TO SEE IT, WILL IT STILL BURN A PART OF THE FOREST DOWN? THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS YES. OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY DOES NOT DICTATE WHAT IS REAL, BUT MERELY WHAT WE ARE PERCEIVING AS AN ACTIVE PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE EXIST. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES, HOW DO WE INCLUDE THIS LIGHTNING STRIKE IN OUR LIVES SO THAT WE CAN BE AN ACTIVE FORCE IN STOPPING THE FOREST FIRE? THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE. SINCE WE CANT CHANGE WHERE THE LIGHTNING STRIKES, WE HAVE TO ALWAYS BE OUT LOOKING FOR IT. IN SHORT, IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD, WE HAVE TO BE AN ACTIVE PIECE IN IT. OUR BODIES ARE TEMPLES FOR OUR MINDS FLESHY PRISONS WITH WHICH WE TRAVERSE THIS LIFE IN ORDER TO SEEK BALANCE AND PEACE AND FREEDOM. HOWEVER, IN THIS BELIEF, OUR BODIES ARE STILL PLAYERS IN THE GAME OF LIFE; THEY ARE THETEMPLE WITHI WHICH OUR MINDS RESIDE, SO SHOULDNT WE BE TREATING OUR TEMPLES LIKE TEMPLES?! AND BY THIS, I MEAN TO PUSH OUR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND STAMINA TO THEIR LIMITS AND TO SEEK CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT ON THIS PHYSICAL FORM IN WHICH EXIST. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUS AAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. LETS PLAY THE WHAT IF GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS: WHAT IF YOU ARE WALKING TO YOUR CAR AND THREE PEOPLE GET THE DROP ON YOU; COULD YOU DEFEND YOURSELF? WHAT IF YOUR HOME CATCHES ON FIRE AND THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THE SECOND STORY WINDOW; DO YOU KNOW HOW TO JUMP AND LAND SAFELY? WHAT IF YOUR SON WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM? WHAT IF YOU WORKED A FEW MINUTES FROM HOME AND YOUR WIFE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND NEEDED YOU HOME IMMEDIATELY,BUT YOUR CAR WAS DEAD IN THE PARKING LOT, COULD YOU RUN ALL THE WAY HOME? CAN YOU PROTECT THE ONES YOU LOVE? COULD YOU OUTRUN SOMETHING HUNTING YOU DOWN? CAN YOU SURVIVE ON YOUR OWN WHEN TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE WITHIN REACH TO HELP YOU? I SPENT THE WEEK PRACTICING HUAQUAN AND RUNNING. MY BEST FRIEND, ALSO AN ADVENTURE ENTHUSIAST, AND I SPENT THE WEEKENDCLIMBING THROUGH AERIAL OBSTACLE COURSES IN HE TREES OF THE BERKHIRES IN MASSACHUSETTS.AFTER THE LONG WEEKEND, I BEGAN THE WEEK LIKE I ALWAYS DO, EXHAUSTED; BUT I COULD FEEL THE HAPPINESS IN EACH SORE MUSCLE FIBER. THE ELONGATED SIGH AS ONE SETTLES IN TO THE COUCH AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, OR INTO A HOT TUB ON THE FIRST DAY OF VACATION, THAT IS WHAT EACH OF MY MUSCLES FEELS. AFTER MY BODY IS SPENT AND I FINALLY SETTLE IN TO RELAX, I CAN HEAR A UNANIMOUSAAAAAAAAAAAHH COMING FROM EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY. SO WHAT HAS THIS SHOWN ME? WELL FIRT, LETS RECAP THE RECENT FOUR WEEKS CHALLENGES: I HAVE BEGUN TO REFINE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT I HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SINCE I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY. MY GIRLFRIEND STARTED A NEW JOB AS A PHOTOGRAPHER FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHICH REQUIRES HER TO BE WAKING UP AT 3:30AM MOST MORNINGS (LAST NIGHT WE AWOKE AT 1:45AM). I HAVE BEGUN TO WAKE UP WITH HER, AS OPPOSED TO 6AM, AND ENSURE THAT HER BREAKFAST/ LUNCH ARE READY FOR THE DAY. I DONT WORK OUT FOR TWO HOURS, BUT FOR A HALF AN HOUR: A WARM UP ROUTINE CONSISTING OF PUSH UPS, SIT UPS, LEG RAISES, AND TRICEP DIPS. I SPEND THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING IMMERSED IN THE ONLINE WORLD CHECKING EMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS, NETWORKING, WORKING ON WRITING/ EDITING, OR SOME MORNINGS JUST GAMING. AS MY LIFE EVOLVES, SO MUST I. THOSE THAT ARE AFRAID OF CHANGE GET LEFT IN THE DUST.  WHAT IS VERTIGO? FEAR OF FALLING? NO, VERTIGO IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN FEAR OF FALLING. IT IS THE VOICE OF THE EMPTINESS BELOW US WHICH TEMPTS AND LURES US, IT IS THE DESIRE TO FALL, AGAINST WHICH, TERRIFIED, WE DEFEND OURSELVES. I TIME LAST WEEK WORKING ON EXACTLY WHAT I SET OUT TO DO. I DREW UP A BUSINESS PLAN FOR LAUNCHING MY OWN COMPANY.OVER THE COURSE THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE RESEARCHED SIMILAR PEOPLE TO MYSELF AND THEIR VENTURES. THE VERDICT IS IN: STARTING OUT ON YOUR OWN IS DIFFICULT; IN WAYS THAT I COULD SIT HERE AND DESCRIBE TO YOU, BUT I DONT WANT YOU TO BE AFRAID OF EVER DOING IT.IT REQUIRES PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE AND A LOT OF HARD WORK. AS ANAIS NIN WROTE, LIFE SHRINKS OR EXPANDS IN PROPORTION TO ONES COURAGE. IF YOU DESIRE STRONGLY ENOUGH AND POSSESS THE PROPER COURAGE, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE. I PRESENTED MYBUSINESS PLAN TO MY BEST FRIEND OVER COFFEE. WE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF MY PLAN. IT WILL REQUIRE HUGE EFFORT AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR FREE TIME. HOWEVER, AFTER MUCH DELIBERATING, WE HAVE DECIDED TO PURSUE THIS AVENUE AS A MEANS TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE.IT WILL STILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE BUILD UP A PLATFORM FROM WHICH WE CAN LAUNCH. FOR NOW, THIS MEANSTHAT THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS OF MY JOURNEY HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS IM WELL ON THE WAY TO LOVING MY LIFE AND FINDING MORE AND MORE WAYS TO BATTLE MY DEPRESSION WHEN IT REARS ITS UGLY HEAD! HOWEVER, IM NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET, AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS METAPHOR, THATS A GOOD THING. THE ONLY WAY IN LIFE WE COULD EVER HEAR THAT TREE FALL, OR STOP THAT FOREST FIRE, IS TO BE PRESENT; AND THAT MEANS PUTTING YOURSELF INTO SITUATIONS THAT YOU WOULDNT NORMALLY BE IN. THOUGH WHAT IS NORMAL? THE TREND OF A THING TO REMAIN AT A CONSTANT ACCEPTED BY A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN PLACE. BECAUSE NORMAL FOR YOU MAY NOT BE NORMAL FOR ME. BECAUSE NORMAL ALL OVER THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT.  LIVE. JOURNEY. ADVENTURE. ALL OF LIFE IS ADVENTUR. BUT DYLLON, I DONT HAVE THE TIME TO BE ADVENTURING, OR STARTING NEW THINGS IM AN INDOORS GUY, GOING OUT AND ADVENTURING JUST ISNT FOR ME I LIVE IN A CITY, WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND A TREE IN A CITY IN 2015? THESE ARE ALL VALID CONCERNS. BUT OTHER THAN THE LAST GUY WHO IS STILL CAUGHT UP ON THE TREE METAPHOR, KEEP IN MIND WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY, ADVENTURE. TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER ANY TIME PERIOD IN YOUR LIFE. OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE REMEMBERING THE TIME PERIOD BASED ON THE EVENTS. YOU DONT REMEMBER EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR DAYS BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE WASNT EXCITING; EVERY MINUTE DIDNT LEAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION ON YOU. WHAT STANDS OUT IN LIFE WHAT REALLY GIVES YOU ENERGY AND MAKES YOU GO IS THE UNUSUAL, THE CHANGE, &  THE AWESOME. ANY EXCITING, BOLD, AND USUALLY RISKY UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME THIS IS ADVENTURE.  BUILDING A FORT WITH YOUR KIDS. COOKING A FOREIGN DISH FOR AROUND THE WORLD NIGHT FOR YOUR WIFE. SEEING A TREND? REMEMBER: CHALLENGING YOURSELF WILL ONLY PRODUCE POSITIVE EFFECTS. NEW EXPERIENCES CAN ONLY CAUSE US TO GROW. THUSLY, MY CHALLENGE FOR THIS UPCOMING WEEK WILL BE TO ADVENTURE AT LEAST ONCE A DAY, AND DO SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING AT LEAST ONCEEACH WEEK. LIVE LIKE YOUR LIFES DISEASE IS MYSTERY, AND THE CURE IS CURIOSITY. CURIOSITY IS THE FUEL OF THE SOUL. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU ARE NOT SURE WHERE TO START, WRITE OR TWEET TO ME! AND COME BACK FOR NEXT WEEKS ARTICLE!

963	THE AUSTRALIAN SHAREMARKET CLOSED MORE THAN 2 PER CENT LOWER TODAY, AMID A BROAD-BASED SELL-OFF ACROSS ASIAN SHAREMARKETS AND AFTER THE RESERVE BANK BOARD HELD THE CASH RATE STEADY AT 2 PER CENT. AT THE OFFICIAL 4.15PM (AEST) CLOSE, THE BENCHMARK S&P/ASX200 HAD FALLEN 110.6 POINTS, OR 2.12 PER CENT, TO 5096.4, WHILE THE BROADER ALL ORDINARIES HAD LOST 105.1 POINTS, OR 2.01 PER CENT, TO 5117. WEAK MANUFACTURING DATA OUT OF CHINA SPARKED A SELL-OFF ON ASIAN BOURSES, WHICH SAW ALL MAJOR EXCHANGES KICK OFF TUESDAY IN THE RED. CHINA'S OFFICIAL MANUFACTURING PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX FOR AUGUST CAME IN AT 49.7, BELOW LAST MONTH'S READING OF 50.0. A NUMBER BELOW 50.0 IMPLIES A CONTRACTION OF THE INDUSTRY. CHINA'S SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX WAS DOWN MORE THAN 2 PER CENT JUST BEFORE THE AUSTRALIAN CLOSE, WHILE TOKYO'S NIKKEI STOCK AVERAGE AND SOUTH KOREA'S KOSPI ALSO LOST GROUND. MEANWHILE, THE RESERVE BANK'S DECISION TO HOLD THE CASH RATE STEADY AT ITS SEPTEMBER BOARD MEETING WAS IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS. ADDING TO THE DOWNBEAT SENTIMENT WAS AUSTRALIAS CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT UPDATE, WITH THE AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS FINDING IT HAD BLOWN OUT TO 4.7 PER CENT OF GDP OR $19 BILLION, CLOSE TO ITS LARGEST ON RECORD AND ABOVE ESTIMATES OF $16BN. THE ASX OPENED LOWER OFF THE POOR OVERNIGHT LEADS AND HAS CONTINUED TO TREND DOWN THROUGHOUT THE DAY, WITH DECLINES INCREASING IN INTENSITY AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE CHINESE PMI NUMBERS, IG MARKET ANALYST ANGUS NICHOLSON SAID. MR NICHOLSON SAID THE RBA'S CASH RATE DECISION HAD NOTED SOME FURTHER SOFTENING IN CONDITIONS IN CHINA, AND BY THE END OF THE SESSION EVEN ENERGY STOCKS HAD BEEN UNABLE TO HOLD EARLY GAINS OFF THE BACK OF A THIRD STRAIGHT SESSION OF 5 PER CENT-PLUS GAINS FOR OIL PRICES OVERNIGHT, WITH BANKS ALSO SINKING BELOW THEIR LONG TERM PRICE-TO-EARNINGS RATIO. THE FACT THAT INVESTORS ARE EVEN ESCHEWING HIGH-YIELDING BANK STOCKS WITH REASONABLE VALUATIONS IS INDICATIVE OF A VERY NEGATIVE SENTIMENT IN THE MARKET, HE SAID. AFTER THEIR EARLY OIL-PRICE RELATED SURGE, ENERGY STOCKS WERE 2.31 PER CENT IN THE RED AT THE CLOSE -- MIRRORING MOST OTHER CATEGORIES IN THE ALL-SECTOR DECLINE -- AS WOODSIDE PETROLEUM FELL 1.98 PER CENT TO $31.62, OIL SEARCH DIPPED 0.88 PER CENT TO $6.74 AND SANTOS PLUNGED 6.63 PER CENT TO $4.79. FINANCIAL STOCKS WERE DRAGGING HEAVILY ON THE BOURSE OFF 2.45 PER CENT AS A SECTOR -- WITH COMMONWEALTH BANK DROPPING 2.37 PER CENT TO $73.30 AND ANZ SLIDING 3.08 PER CENT WEAKER TO $27.07. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK HAD SUNK 2.47 PER CENT TO $30.40 WHILE WESTPAC WAS DOWN 2.89 PER CENT TO $30.20. MATERIALS WERE 1.84 PER CENT WEAKER AS BHP BILLITON LOST 2.1 PER CENT TO $24.65 AND RIO TINTO RETREATED 1.83 PER CENT TO $49.37. AND CONSUMER STAPLES WERE OFF 2.22 PER CENT, WITH WOOLWORTHS SLIDING 3.14 PER CENT TO $25.57 AND WESFARMERS SHEDDING 1.62 PER CENT TO $40.00. MEANWHILE, QANTAS LIFTED 3.27 PER CENT TO $3.47 WHILE TELSTRA WAS OFF 1.91 PER CENT TO $5.66. LOOKING FORWARD, TOMORROW THE ABS ISSUES THE KEY QUARTERLY ECONOMIC GROWTH ESTIMATES IN THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS PUBLICATION.
964	HOUSTON THE ANGELS GOT THE VICTORY THEY NEEDED, THANKS TO THE HITTERS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO DO MOST OF THE HEAVY LIFTING AND A BULLPEN PICKING UP THE SLACK FOR A LOST MEMBER. MIKE TROUT BELTED HIS 40 TH HOMER AND ALBERT PUJOLS FOLLOWED WITH A TITANIC BLOAST OF HIS OWN IN THE FIRST INNING, SETTING THE ANGELS ON THEIR WAY TO A 4-3 VICTORY OVER THE HOUSTON ASTROS ON TUESDAY NIGHT. RELIEVERS TREVOR GOTT AND HUSTON STREET EACH WENT BEYOND THEIR NORMAL THREE OUTS, FILLING THE VOID LEFT BY INJURED JOE SMITH . STREET GAVE UP A TWO-OUT DOUBLE IN THE NINTH - A 430-FOOT DRIVE BY CARLOS CORREA OFF TAL'S HILL IN CENTER FIELD - BEFORE HE STRUCK OUT EVAN GATTIS TO END IT. THE ANGELS GOT BACK THE GAME THEY LOST MONDAY, PULLING BACK WITHIN 2 GAMES OF HOUSTON IN THE WILD-CARD RACE WITH 11 GAMES TO GO. IF THE ANGELS CAN WIN WEDNESDAY, THEY WILL ACHIEVE THE SERIES VICTORY THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MINIMUM THEY NEEDED TO STAY WITHIN REASONABLE STRIKING DISTANCE IN THE RACE. THEY GOT THIS GAME STARTED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IMMEDIATELY. ERICK AYBAR LED OFF BY REACHING ON A BUNT SINGLE. AN OUT LATER, TROUT BLASTED A DRIVE JUST OVER THE FENCE IN LEFT-CENTER, REACHING THE 40-HOMER MILESTONE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS YOUNG CAREER. TROY GLAUS IS THE ONLY OTHER PLAYER TO HIT 40 HOMERS IN A SEASON FOR THE ANGELS. GLAUS HIT 47 IN 2000 AND 41 IN 2001. IT WAS TROUTS SIXTH HOMER IN HIS PAST 11 GAMES. JUST AFTER TROUTS HOMER, PUJOLS DRILLED ONE UP NEAR THE TRAIN TRACKS ATOP MINUTE MAID PARK. THE BLAST WAS PUJOLS 36 TH HOMER OF THE SEASON, AND THE 556 TH OF HIS CAREER. HE PASSED MANNY RAMIREZ, MOVING INTO SOLE POSSESSION OF 14 TH ON THE ALL-TIME LIST. THE 3-0 LEAD DIDNT LAST LONG. HECTOR SANTIAGO GAVE UP BACK-TO-BACK HOMERS TO MARWIN GONZALEZ AND CHRIS CARTER IN THE SECOND. SANTIAGO HAD A SHAKY NIGHT, WALKING FIVE AND ALLOWING FOUR HITS. SANTIAGO WAS LIKELY NOT A FAN OF THE STRIKE ZONE CALLED BY PLATE UMP CHRIS CONROY, BECAUSE HE SLAMMED DOWN THE ROSIN BAG AFTER HIS LEADOFF WALK IN THE SIXTH. CONROY EJECTED SANTIAGO AS HE WAS BEING PULLED FROM THE GAME, LIKELY JUST COSTING HIM A FINE. SANTIAGOS EARLY EXIT LEFT THE ANGELS BULLPEN TO MANEUVER 12 OUTS WITHOUT SMITH, WHO IS OUT WITH A SPRAINED ANKLE. FERNANDO SALAS GOT THE FIRST THREE. GOTT PICKED UP FOUR OUTS. JOSE ALVAREZ , WHO LIKELY WOULD HAVE BEEN NOWHERE NEAR THE LATE INNINGS OF THIS GAME, GOT ONE OUT. STREET THEN ENTERED IN THE EIGHTH WITH A 4-2 LEAD AND PROCEEDED TO THROW A WILD PITCH, ALLOWING THE ASTROS TO PULL WITHIN A RUN. STREET THEN STRUCK OUT JAKE MARISNICK. IN THE NINTH, HE WENT THROUGH THE TOP OF THE HOUSTON ORDER TO RECORD HIS LEAGUE-LEADING 39 TH SAVE, HIS THIRD OF MORE THAN THREE OUTS. CONTACT THE WRITER: JLFLETCHER@OCREGISTER.COM
965	FOOD AND DRINK ENTERTAINMENT ART & DESIGN PHOTO & VIDEO FOOD AND DRINK WASSHOI BEER SAKE AND SUMIBI POSTED BY TAM KENDI 15. SEP, 2015 /A ITS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT JAPANESE FOOD AND BEER ARE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN.ONE MAY EVEN SAY, WASSHOI!, AN EXCLAMATION OF EXCITEMENT OR CELEBRATION IN JAPANESE. A SAYING SIMILAR TO THE SPANISH HOLA. LUCKILY, THATS EXACTLY WHY JAPANESE RESTAURANT/BAR, WASSHOI BEER SAKE AND SUMIBI, HAS OPENED IN PRAHRAN MARKET PROVIDING A TANTALISING SELECTION OF GRILLED MEATS, SAKE AND BEER. RENOWNED CHEF IKUEI ARAKANE IS AT THE REIGNS OF THE 29 SEAT SUMIBIYAKI BAR. WELL KNOWN FOR HIS SPECTACULAR JAPANESE CUISINE AT KOKO RESTAURANT IN CROWN AND TAXI IN FEDERATION SQUARE. WHETHER GOING FOR A QUICK BITE TO EAT WITH FRIENDS, OR A FEW BEERS AND SNACKS AS THE WEATHER WARMS UP, WASSHOI IS CONVENIENTLY SITUATED IN PRAHRAN MARKET. THE PERFECT PLACE TO FEAST ON SOME TERIYAKI CHICKEN, OR PORK BELLY AFTER DOING THE SHOPPING. SUMIBIYAKI IS RELATIVELY RARE IN MELBOURNE, IN COMPARISON TO THE ABUNDANCE OF JAPANESE FOOD ON OFFER. DIFFERING TO YAKITORI, JAPANESE GRILLED MEAT ON SKEWERS, SUMIBIYAKI LITERALLY MEANS CHARCOAL GRILL IN JAPANESE. WHILE BOTH OFFER GRILLED MEAT, IT WOULD BE MORTALLY INSULTING TO CONFUSE THE TWO. SUMIBIYAKI BARS ARE A CURRENT TREND IN JAPAN AND FREQUENT FOR OFFICE WORKERS AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, WHERE CHUGGING DOWN A COLD GLASS OF BEER IS RUDIMENTARY. WASSHOI OFFERS ONE OF JAPANS MOST POPULAR BEERS, KIRIN, WHICH IS AVAILABLE CHILLED AND ON TAP. SAKE CONNOISSEURS WILL BE IN FOR A TREAT WITH NEW SELECTIONS AVAILABLE EVERY MONTH, INCLUDING LOCALLY BREWED OPTIONS. THE MENU IS TO SPAN THE LENGTH OF THE BAR OFFERING A HUGE SELECTION OF FOOD AND DRINK. SO AS THE WEATHER WARMS UP, HEAD DOWN TO PRAHRAN MARKET AND SAY, WASSHOI!

967	BY JOE KOIZUMI A WORLD TITLE TWINBILL WILL TAKE PLACE TODAY (SUNDAY) IN OSAKA, JAPAN. WBA FLYWEIGHT CHAMP KAZUTO IOKA (17-1, 10 KOS) WILL MAKE HIS INITIAL DEFENSE OF HIS THIRD BELT AGAINST ARGENTINE ROBERTO DOMINGO SOSA (26-2-1, 14 KOS), WHILE IBF MINIMUM TITLIST KATSUNARI TAKAYAMA (29-7-0-1NC, 11 KOS) WILL PUT HIS TITLE ON THE LINE AGAINST YOUNGER COMPATRIOT RYUJI HARA (19-1, 11 KOS) IN HIS SECOND DEFENSE AFTER HIS CORONATION LAST DECEMBER. THE WEIGH-IN CEREMONY WAS HELD YESTERDAY. IOKA SCALED IN AT THE 112-POUND CLASS LIMIT TO 111 FOR SOSA. TAKAYAMA TIPPED THE BEAM A QUARTER POUND LIGHTER AT 111.75 THAN HARA AT THE 108-POUND LIMIT. IOKA, 26, IS THE FASTEST BOXER THAT WON THREE BELTS IN AS MANY DIFFERENT CLASSES IN ONLY EIGHTEEN PRO BOUTS, SURPASSING JEFF FENECH. THE EXCELLENT BOXER-PUNCHER ACQUIRED SIX NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS AS A KOKOKU HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AND COMPILED A 95-10 AMATEUR MARK, THOUGH HE FAILED TO BE AN OLYMPIAN DUE TO SOME CONTROVERSIAL DECISIONS. KAZUTO, THE NEPHEW OF FORMERLY TWO-TIME WORLD CHAMP HIROKI IOKA, LATELY CAPTURED THE WBA 112-POUND BELT BY EARNING A WELL-RECEIVED MAJORITY VERDICT OVER DEFENDING TITLIST JUAN CARLOS REVECO THIS APRIL. JUAN DOMINGO SOSA, WITH SO GOOD CREDENTIALS, ONCE DEFEATED FUTURE WORLD CHAMP ZOLANI TETE, A VERY TALL SOUTHPAW, IN 2012 BUT FAILED TO WIN THE VACANT IBF 115-POUND THRONE, LOSING A DECISION TO JUAN CARLOS SANCHEZ NEXT YEAR. SOSA MAY BE A TOUGH OPPONENT THAT IOKA SHOULD NOT TAKE LIGHTLY AND BE CAREFUL OF. TAKAYAMA, SEVEN YEARS HIS SENIOR AT 32, HAS ALREADY GAINED THE BELTS OF ALL THE FOUR ORGANIZATIONS IN THE 105-POUND CATEGORYAT A SEPARATE TIME. THE VETERAN MAKING HIS SECOND DEFENSE OF THE IBF THRONE WILL FACE THE YOUNGER CHALLENGER HARA BELT WHO ONCE ATTEMPTED TO BE A JOCKEY RATHER THAN A PROFESSIONAL BOXER ALTHOUGH HE WON FOUR NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL CHAMPIONSHIPS. TAKAYAMA, A PREFIGHT FAVORITE DUE TO HIS SUPERIOR EXPERIENCE, WILL SEE HOW FAST THE FORMER JOCKEY-ASPIRANT HARA WILL BE. THIS CARD IS PRESENTED BY IOKA PROMOTIONS. THE POST IOKA, TAKAYAMA TO MAKE TITLE DEFENSES TODAY APPEARED FIRST ON BOXING NEWS .
968	THE ISSUE: THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE BY THE END OF THE MONTH WHETHER IT WILL PUT THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST. WE BELIEVE: FISH AND WILDLIFE SHOULD HOLD OFF AND LET CURRENT CONSERVATION EFFORTS WORK. WE DO THINK THE AGENCY SHOULD MAINTAIN ITS THRELAT AS A MEANS TO KEEP THOSE PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD. TEDLL US WHAT YOU THINK: CONTACT US VIA EMAIL AT OPINION@WYOMINGNEWS.COM .  BUT SUPPORTERS OF THE 11-STATE EFFORT TO SAVE THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE SAY THEY WILL LOSE MUCH OF THEIR MOMENTUM - AND PERHAPS THE BIRD ITSELF - IF THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE LISTS IT AS ENDANGERED LATER THIS MONTH. WE AGREE. IN TRUTH, JUST THE THREAT OF THAT LISTING HAS DRIVEN A BROAD COALITION OF STATE AGENCIES, PRIVATE INDUSTRY, LANDOWNERS AND NONPROFIT GROUPS TO COMMENDABLY JOIN HANDS, MAKE COMPROMISES AND SET IN PLACE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS TO SAVE THE GROUSE. TAKE THAT THREAT AWAY, OR PUT THE AUTHORITY FOR CONTROLLING THE PROCESS INTO FEDERAL HANDS - AND PERHAPS COMPLICATE AND OVER-REGULATE THE EFFORT - AND MANY OF THEM SIMPLY WILL WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE. AT STAKE IN THIS DISCUSSION IS A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY DEVELOPED BY THE U.SK. DEPARTMENTS OF INTERIOR AND AGRICULTURE TO MANAGE THE GROUSE ON BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT AND FOREST SERVICE LAND. IT INCORPORATES THE BATTLE PLANS DEVELMOPED SEPARATELY IN RECENT YEARS BY THE 11 STATES - STRETCHING FROM WYOMING TO CALIFORNIA AND NORTHWARD TO THE CANADIAN BORDER - IN THE BIRDS' RANGE. (WYOMING HAS BEEN AMONG THE LEADERS IN THE PROCESS, MAINLY BECAUSE MOST OF THE BIRDS RESIDE WITHIN ITS BORDERS. A FEDERAL LISTING COULD HAVE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES HERE, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF RESTRICTING THE ESSENTIAL ENERGY INDUSTRY.) THE GOAL OF THE BLM EFFORT IS TO SAVE THE BIRD BY PROTECTING AND BUILDING UP ITS SAGEBRUSH HABITAT. ITS RANGE HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM 500,000 TOC 250,000 SQUARE MILES, AND ITS NUMBERS HAVE DROPPED FROM 16 MILLION, BY SOME ESTIMATES, TO ABOUT 400,000. AND SCIENTISTS BELIEVE ITS NUMBERS CONTINUE TO DIP. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE PLANS SET ASIDE "CORE AREAS," WHERE DEVELOPMENT IS NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE OR WHERE WORK STOPPAGES OCCUR AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR, SUCH AS IN MATING SEASON. OTHER EFFORTS ALSO ARE MADE TO PROTECT THE GROUSE IN THESE ESSENTIAL AREAS, SUCH ASV DISCOURAGING WIND DEVELOPMENT OR BANNING OIL AND GAS PIPELINES AND TRANSMISSION LINES. BUT THERE ARE OTHER BENEFITS FROM THESE EFFORTS.  BOOSTING THE GROUSE'S HABITAT HELPS THEM AS WELL. ONE BENEFICIARY OF IMPROVED SAGEBRUSH THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO WYOMINGITES' HEARTS IS THE MULE DEER, WHICH WINTERS THERE. THE DEER'S NUMBERS ALSO ARE ON THE DECLINE IN THE COWBOY STATE. OUR HOPE IS THAT FISH AND WILDLIFE WILL HOLD OFF ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING AND ALLOW THESE BLM PLANS TO BE PUT INTO ACTION. THE AGENCY SHOULD MAINTAIN THE THREAT OF LISTING, PERHAPS CREATING TIMELINES FOR REVIEWING OUTCOMES, IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM MOVING FORWARD. BUT IF THE PLANS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THIS ACTUALLY COULD SET A NEW DIRECTION FOR WORKING WITH THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT, RATHER THAN ALL SIDES ACTING AS ADVERSARIES. ADDITIONALLY, THIS NEWSPAPER URGES WYOMING'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO BACK OFF OF ITS EFFORTS TO FORESTALL FEDERAL SAGE GROUSE ACTION THROUGH LEGISLATION. THAT MIGHT DELAY A LISTING, BUT IT ALSO COULD IMPLODE THESE COALITIONS BY REMOVING THEIR INCENTIVE TO WORK FOR THE BIRD AND FOR THEIR STATES. AND WITHOUT THESE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS, THE GROUSE THEN COULD END UP IN A WORSE PLACE AFTER A FEDERAL MORATORIUM, SINCE EFFORTS TO BUILD THEIR HABITAT WOULD HAVE FALTERED. AND THAT WOULD VIRTUALLY GUARANTEE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTING DOWNF THE ROAD. WE ENCOURAGE BOTH CONGRESS AND THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE TO LET THIS INNOVATIVE CONSERVATION EFFORT WORK. IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO WASTE THE TIME AND MONEY SPENT ALREADY TO SAVE THE GREATER SAGE GROUSE WHEN IT VERY WELL COULD YIELD REAL FRUIT IN THE YEARS AHEAD.

970	VIC: A FAMILY HAS BEEN FINED $205,000 FOR OPERATING A "FILTHY" PUPPY FARM. RELATED COVERAGE: THREE FAMILY MEMBERS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THE WORST PUPPY FARMS PROSECUTED BY THE RSPCA HAVE BEEN FINED $205,000 PLUS $82,580 IN COSTS. DEAN PEACE, 46, AND HIS PARENTS JOHN AND PHYLLIS PEACE, AGED 75 AND 74, OF COHUNA, WERE SENTENCED IN THE BENDIGO MAGISTRATES COURT ON THURSDAY TO MORE THAN 200 COMBINED CHARGES FOR THE PUPPY FARM AT PYRAMID HILL. THE FARM KEPT 235 DOGS AND PUPPIES AT ITS PEAK UNTIL THE FIRST RSPCA RAID IN AUGUST 2013. THE FAMILY HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP TWO WORKING DOGS FOR THEIR CATTLE FARM. THE DOGS WILL BE REGISTERED TO JOHN PEACE, BUT DEAN PEACE IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE THEIR CARE. MAGISTRATE DAVID FARAM CONSIDERED THE FAMILYS CIRCUMSTANCES IN IMPOSING THE FINE, BELIEVING A PRISON TERM WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE. HE DESCRIBED THE PUPPY FARM AS UNKEMPT AND IN A GENERALLY SQUALID CONDITION. IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT ALL OF THE ANIMALS WERE LIVING IN TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES, MR FARAM SAID. IT WAS ALSO PLAIN FROM THE VIDEO AND THE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF THE ANIMALS AND PUPPIES WERE IN A DREADFUL PHYSICAL CONDITION. THE MAGISTRATE FOUND DEAN PEACE DID NOT SEEK VETERINARY ASSISTANCE WHEN NECESSARY, DESPITE MR PEACES ASSERTIONS. HE ALSO FOUND HIS PARENTS, JOHN AND PHYLLIS, HAD NO PRIOR OFFENCES AND HAD LIVED UNBLEMISHED LIVES. THEY ARE ELDERLY AND I AM SATISFIED THAT THEY MADE VARIOUS DECISIONS AT TIMES OVER THE YEARS THAT THEY THOUGHT WERE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THEIR SON DEAN, PARTICULARLY THE DECISIONS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE PUPPY FARMING BUSINESS APPARENTLY FOR DEANS BENEFIT AFTER DEANS FIRST, THEN SECOND SERIOUS MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT, MR FARAM SAID. THAT SAID, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO IGNORE THE VERY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION THAT THE PUPPY FARMING BUSINESS MADE TO THE FINANCES OF THE FARM GENERALLY. THE FARM EARNED $243,000 IN SALES OVER TWO YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS, UNTIL DECEMBER 2013. DEAN PEACE WAS FINED $25,000 FOR THE ANIMAL CRUELTY CHARGES, AND $3000 FOR LODDON SHIRE CHARGES. JOHN PEACE WAS FINED $60,000, AND $15,000 FOR VIOLATING LODDON SHIRE PLANNING LAWS. PHYLLIS PEACE ALSO RECEIVED A $60,000 FINE. THEIR COMPANY JB AND PW PEACE PTY LTD WAS FINED $40,000. THEY WERE ALSO MADE TO PAY ALL RSPCA COSTS OF $67,130, AND HALF OF THE LODDON SHIRE COURT COSTS. THEY CAME TO $15,450. DURING THE FIRST DAY OF SENTENCING IN THE KERANG MAGISTRATES COURT IN MAY, RSPCA PROSECUTORS OUTLINED THE FILTHY CONDITIONS AT THE FARM AND THE RANGE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES RAMPANT AMONG THE DOGS AND PUPPIES. THIRTY-ONE DOGS WERE DANGEROUSLY UNDERWEIGHT, 35 WERE SUFFERING SEVERE MATTING OF THE FUR FROM FECAL MATTER, 30 HAD DENTAL DISEASE, 10 SUFFERED EAR INFECTIONS AND THREE HAD UNTREATED WOUNDS. OTHER CONDITIONS INCLUDED HEART MURMURS, PROLAPSED EYELIDS AND EYE DISEASE. ONE PUPPY HAD TO BE EUTHANISED. THE RSPCA DESCRIBED THE PEACE FAMILY PUPPY FARM AS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG FOR ILLEGAL DOG BREEDING BUSINESSES IN COUNTRY VICTORIA. THE CASE WAS THE BIGGEST THE SOCIETY HAS PROSECUTED IN VICTORIA AND IT WELCOMED THE FINAL OUTCOME OF A $205,000 FINE, PLUS COURT COSTS. RSPCA INSPECTORATE MANAGER ALLIE JALBERT SAID IT WAS PLEASING TO SEE ILLEGAL OPERATORS BEING PROSECUTED, BUT SAID MORE WORK NEEDED TO BE DONE. THIS CASE HAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE HIDDEN SUFFERING OF DOGS IN THESE FACILITIES, AND WE WOULD SAY THIS IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG, SHE SAID. WE KNOW THIS IS THE TIP OF ICEBERG AND WE ARE OUT THERE INVESTIGATING FURTHER ONES AND YOU WILL SEE OTHER CASES LIKE THIS THIS BEFORE THE COURTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. DEFENCE COUNSEL JASON GULLACI SPOKE OF DEAN PEACES TWO LIFE THREATENING CAR CRASHES IN 1998 AND 2007 DURING THE SECOND DAY OF SENTENCING. DEANS PARENTS JOHN AND PHYLLIS PEACE LEFT HIM IN CHARGE OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE FARM, AS HIS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CAPABILITIES HAD BEEN GREATLY DIMINISHED SINCE THE SECOND CRASH, DESTROYING EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS.

973	SINGERS NICKI MINAJ AND MILEY CYRUS HAD A PUBLIC SPAT AT THE 2015 VMAS, HOSTED BY MILEY. DURING THE LIVE BROADCAST ON SUNDAY, NICKI CALLED MILEY A "BITCH" FOR TALKING ABOUT HER IN THE PRESS. ACCORDING TO AN INSIDER, "NICKI WAS LIVID WITH MILEY AND DECIDED TO AIR HER FEELINGS ONSTAGE." IN FACT, IT WAS REPORTED THAT MTV STAFFERS HAD TO KEEP NICKI AND MILEY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER FOR THE NIGHT TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION. IT IS HARD TO KNOW IF THEIR FIGHTING WAS STAGED OR AUTHENTIC. EITHER WAY, IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SHOUTING ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS IN PUBLIC WHEN YOU'RE UPSET IS THE BEST WAY TO GET YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS. IN NICKI'S CASE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A STRONG DESIRE TO REACH HER FAN BASE AND SHARE HER RAGE TOWARD MILEY. MAYBE SHE THOUGHT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE FACE. BUT IT REALLY ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING WITH A PARTNER IN FRONT OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS AT A HOLIDAY MEAL. SO WHEN YOU'RE IRKED AT SOMEONE, WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO LET THEM KNOW - TALK TO THEM IN PRIVATE ABOUT IT, OR LET THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW' VERY OFTEN WHEN WE ARE MAD AT SOMEONE WHO HAS HURT OUR FEELINGS OUR INCLINATION IS TO GET BACK AT THEM BY LETTING OTHERS KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO MAKE US FEEL MISTREATED AND WRONGED. IN FACT, THAT DYNAMIC IS THE HOOK OF REALITY TELEVISION. DOING THAT, THOUGH, AND BEING VOCAL ABOUT THE BAD ENERGY BETWEEN YOU MAY UNWITTINGLY PUT THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BY MAKING THEM FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE SIDES. SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET SO CAUGHT UP IN THE ANGER OF THE MOMENT THAT IT CAN SPILLOVER BEYOND THEIR PRIVATE WORLD, AS WE SAW WITH NICKI AND MILEY. BEFORE YOU LET THAT HAPPEN, ASK YOURSELF IF THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP WORTH SAVING. IF YOU DECIDE IT IS, THEN THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO GO RIGHT TO THE SOURCE AND ADDRESS THE CAUSE OF YOUR DISTRESS DIRECTLY WITH THE PERSON WHO UPSET YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE. TELL THEM WHAT THEY SAID AND DID TO SET YOU OFF, AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE AND EXPLAIN. IT WILL ALSO GIVE THE PERSON THE CHANCE TO CLEAR UP ANY MISCOMMUNICATION OR MISUNDERSTANDING THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN YOU. FIGHTING OUT IN THE OPEN JUST SERVES TO FAN THE FLAMES OF THE FURY, BUT A STRAIGHT CONVERSATION MIGHT CLEAR THE AIR AND EVEN HELP TO SALVAGE YOUR RELATIONSHIP. THIS YEAR'S VMAS WERE ALSO WITNESS TO A NUMBER OF BAD FEELINGS BEING SOOTHED, SUCH AS BETWEEN KANYE WEST AND TAYLOR SWIFT. THAT IS TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT NO MATTER HOW ANGRY SOMEONE MIGHT BE AT ONE TIME, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET OVER IT AND MOVE BEYOND IT. THE RAGE CAN DIMINISH AND YOU CAN LET IT GO. WHO KNOWS' MAYBE AT NEXT YEAR'S AWARDS SHOW WE WILL SEE A DIFFERENT EXCHANGE BETWEEN NICKI AND MILEY.PLEASE TUNE IN TO THE DOCTOR ON CALL RADIO HOUR ON HEALTHYLIFE.NET EVERY TUESDAY AT 2 PM EST, 11 AM PST.

974	SOME FARMERS IN HADEJIA, JIGAWA HAVE COMMENDED THE STATE GOVERNMENT OVER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TWO SUGAR FACTORIES BY DANGOTE GROUP AND CRYSTAL SUGAR COMPANY. A CROSS SECTION OF THE FARMERS GAVE THE COMMENDATION IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) IN HADEJIA ON SUNDAY. ALHAJI IDRIS YAU, A COMMERCIAL FARMER, SAID THAT THE EFFORT OF STATE GOVERNMENT IN ENCOURAGING INVESTMENT IN THE SECTOR WAS COMMENDABLE. YAU SAID THE SUGAR FACTORIES WOULD GENERATE EMPLOYMENT AND ENHANCE WEALTH CREATION AMONG RURAL FARMERS. WE COMMEND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUGARCANE PLANTATIONS AND SUGAR FACTORIES IN HADEJIA AND KAUGAMA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS OF THE STATE. THIS IS A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS COMMITMENT TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURING SECTORS, HE SAID. MALAM ABDULLAHI HARUNA, ANOTHER FARMER, SAID THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SUGAR FACTORIES WOULD ENCOURAGE SUGARCANE FARMING IN THE STATE. HARUNA NOTED THAT FARMERS WERE NOT CULTIVATING SUGARCANE DUE TO LACK OF MARKET FOR THE PRODUCE. WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT, FARMERS WHO HITHERTO, ABANDONED THE PLANTATIONS WILL NOW CULTIVATE SUGARCANE, HE SAID. NAN RECALLS THAT THE JIGAWA GOVERNMENT HAD IN THE YEAR 2000 INTRODUCED INDUSTRIAL SUGARCANE FARMING AND ESTABLISHED A SUGAR FACTORY IN HADEJIA. THE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED ABOUT 5, 000 PILOT SUGARCANE PLANTATION IN THE AREA. THE SUGAR FACTORY PROJECT WAS ABANDONED AFTER IT REACHED ABOUT 90 PER CENT COMPLETION STAGE, WHILE THE SUGARCANE PLANTATIONS DESIGNED TO SUPPLY RAW MATERIALS TO THE FACTORY WILTED DUE TO NON COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT. IN ITS DRIVE TO ACTUALIZE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SUGARCANE PRODUCTION PROGRAMME, THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAD IN 2013, SOLD THE ABANDONED SUGAR FACTORY TO CRYSTAL SUGAR COMPANY. THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAD EQUALLY INVITED DANGOTE GROUP TO ESTABLISH ANOTHER SUGAR FACTORY IN KAUGAUMA LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF THE STATE. ALSO SPEAKING, ALHAJI MUHAMMAD ABACHA, THE CHAIRMAN, CRYSTAL SUGAR COMPANY, SAID THAT THE FACTORY WOULD PRODUCE REFINED SUGAR, ANIMAL FEEDS AND ETHANOL AS WELL AS GENERATE 150 MEGAWATTS OF ELECTRICITY IN THE STATE. ABACHA TOLD NAN THAT THE FACTORY WOULD ENGAGED ABOUT 30, 000 WORKERS FROM THE STATE. HE NOTED THAT THE COMPANY WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL 30, 000 HECTRES OF SUGARCANE PLANTATION WHEN IT BECOME FULLY OPERATIONAL. ON HIS PART, ALHAJI ALIKO DANGOTE, THE CHAIRMAN DANGOTE GROUP, ANNOUNCED THAT HIS COMPANY WOULD INVEST 250 MILLION US DOLLARS IN THE PROPOSED SUGAR FACTORY IN THE STATE. DANGOTE, WHO STATED THIS DURING A VISIT TO THE STATE RECENTLY SAID THE SUGAR FACTORY WAS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE OPERATION LATER THIS YEAR. HE SAID THAT ABOUT 20,000 HECTARES FARMLANDS WOULD BE DEVELOPED TO PRODUCE SUGARCANE WITH AN ANNUAL PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF MORE THAN 150,000 METRIC TONNES. DANGOTE EXPLAINED THAT SOME 10, 000 FARMERS WOULD BE ENGAGED IN SUGARCANE CULTIVATION, WHILE 13, 000 INDIGENES OF THE STATE WOULD BE EMPLOYED AS CONVENTIONAL FACTORY WORKERS. WE ARE HOPING TO COMMENCE WORK IN THE FACTORY BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, BECAUSE PRODUCTION OF SUGAR IS A SEASONAL BUSINESS AND THE SEASON IS QUITE SHORT, HE SAID. THE BUSINESS MOGUL ADDED THAT THE FACTORY WOULD UTILISE PRODUCTS FROM SUGARCANE TO PRODUCE ETHANOL FOR VEHICLES, FERTILISER AND ANIMAL FEEDS TO BOOST SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. NAN REPORTS, HOWEVER, THAT BOTH THE TWO FACTORIES OWNED BY DANGOTE GROUP AND CRYSTAL SUGAR COMPANY RESPECTIVELY WERE YET TO COMMENCE OPERATION. (NAN)

976	BY BEN LEVISOHN STOCKS BATTLED BACK IN A BIG WAY TODAY. EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY THE S&P 500 ROSE 2.5% TO 1,969.41, THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ADVANCED 390.30 POINTS, OR 2.4%, TO 16.492.68 AS ALL 30 STOCKS IN THE BLUE-CHIP BENCHMARK FINSIHED HIGHER, AND THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE GAINED 2.7% TO 4,811.93. PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE, ONLY 12 OF THE STOCKS IN THE S&P 500 FINISHED IN THE RED TODAY. THE FOLKS AT BESPOKE INVESTMENT GROUP MARVEL AT THE SHEER NUMBER OF SUCH ALL OR NOTHING DAYS: LONG TERM CLIENTS OF BESPOKE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH OUR TERM ALL OR NOTHING DAYS, BUT FOR THOSE THAT ARENT, AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY IS A DAY WHERE THE NET ADVANCE/DECLINE READING FOR THE S&P 500 (NUMBER OF ADVANCERS ON A DAILY BASIS MINUS NUMBER OF DECLINERS) IS ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400. SINCE THE SELL-OFF REALLY BEGAN IN EARNEST ON 8/20/15, THE S&P 500S DAILY ADVANCE/DECLINE READING HAS BEEN ABOVE +400 OR BELOW 400 ON EIGHT TRADING DAYS THROUGH FRIDAY (AS OF 2PM MONDAY, THE S&P 500S A/D READING IS CURRENTLY ABOVE +400 AGAIN). TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, PRIOR TO 8/20 THERE HAD ONLY BEEN 13 TRADING DAYS IN ALL OF 2015 WHERE THE S&P 500 HAD AN ALL OR NOTHING DAY. WE LOOKED TO SEE HOW COMMON IT HAS BEEN TO SEE EIGHT ALL OR NOTHING DAYS OVER A TWELVE TRADING DAY PERIOD, AND FOUND THAT SINCE OUR DAILY BREADTH DATA BEGINS IN 1990, THESE EVENTS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY RARE. IN FACT, THE ONLY TWO PERIODS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE WAS DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN LATE NOVEMBER/EARLY DECEMBER 2008 (WHERE WE SAW FIVE STRAIGHT DAILY OCCURRENCES) AND ON ONE DAY DURING THE 2011 CORRECTION ON 10/6/11. BMOS BRIAN BELSKI ARGUES THAT S&P 500 FUNDAMENTALS WEATHERED THE STORM: DESPITE A DIFFICULT MONTH FOR STOCK PRICES, UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS REMAINED LARGELY INTACT ACCORDING TO OUR MODELS. AS A RESULT, WE VIEW THE RECENT WEAKNESS AS MORE TECHNICAL IN NATURE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT U.S. ECONOMIC DATA CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. ONE SILVER LINING OF THE RECENT PLUNGE WAS THAT S&P 500 VALUATION REGISTERED ONE OF THE LARGEST MONTHLY CONTRACTIONS OF THIS BULL MARKET. HOWEVER, VALUATION REMAINS ELEVATED FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, BUT HAS RETREATED FROM ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVELS. BY CONTRAST, EARNINGS-RELATED DATA CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OVERALL FUNDAMENTAL LEVELS AND ESPECIALLY REVISIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPROVING SHARPLY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. IN FACT, OUR FUNDAMENTAL COMPOSITE HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT AFTER BOTTOMING EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WHICH SHOULD BE A VIEWED AS A POSITIVE SIGN FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT SOMETHING MORE OMINOUS IS ON THE HORIZON FOR U.S. STOCKS. WHAT, ME WORRY?
977	STEAMCRAFT BY JAMIE HARDY IS A STEAMPUNK ROLE PLAYING GAME SYSTEM AND SETTING PUBLISHED BY PERILOUS JOURNEYS PUBLISHING. THE SETTING IS THE FICTIONAL ONE OF TELLUS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN IT AN EARTH. THIS SUPPLEMENT IS AVAILABLE AS A 217 PAGE PDF WHICH NORMALLY COSTS $14.99 ON RPGNOW, BUT WAS PURCHASED AT AN OFFER PRICE OF ONLY $4.50. OF THE BOOK, ONE PAGE IS THE COVER, THERE IS A ONE PAGE SETTING MAP, THREE PAGES FOR THE STEAMCRAFT CHARACTER SHEET, TWO PAGES OF WEAPONS TABLES, ONE PAGE FRONT MATTER AND ONE PAGE TABLE OF CONTENTS. THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE ALL BLACK AND WHITE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FULL COLOUR FRONT COVER; THE MAJORITY OF THE PAGES INSIDE THE BOOK HAVE A DECORATIVE STEAMPUNK BORDER. THE BOOK IS NOT DIVIDED INTO NUMBERED CHAPTERS AS SUCH, ALTHOUGH IT IS DIVIDED INTO SOMETHING FAIRLY EQUIVALENT. SOME OF THESE COULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE GROUPED TOGETHER INTO VARIOUS SECTIONS. THE INTRODUCTION INTRODUCES STEAMPUNK, STEAMCRAFT, ROLE PLAYING GAMES IN GENERAL AND WHAT IS NEEDED TO PLAY THEM. THE FIRST PART OF THE BOOK CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE THE SETTING. THIS PART STARTS WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, DIVIDED INTO ARCADIAN COAST, GRANITE VALLEY, BADLANDS, CENTRAL SAVANNAH, NORTHERN LAURENTIA, ANATOLIA AND CYMURIA. OF THESE LOCATIONS, THE LATTER THREE ARE PART OF THE GLOBAL WORLD SETTING, WHILST THE OTHERS COMPRISE THE UNCHARTED TERRITORIES, WHICH IS THE AREA IN WHICH PLAYERS WILL BE ADVENTURING. THE UNCHARTED TERRITORIES ARE COVERED IN VARIOUS LEVELS OF DETAIL, WITH THE MOST BEING THE ARCADIAN COAST, THE PRIMARY CIVILISED REGION THAT WILL BE VISITED. ALSO IN THE SETTING PART ARE SOCIETY, THE FAE, RELIGION AND NOTEWORTHY GUILDS & ASSOCIATIONS. THESE ARE LARGELY SELF-EXPLANATORY, COVERING VARIOUS NON-HUMAN RACES, THE STATE OF TECHNOLOGY, WHICH INCLUDES COMPUTER PROGRAMMING AND A SORT OF VERY PRIMITIVE AND LIMITED, EARLY EQUIVALENT OF THE INTERNET, AS THE MECHANICAL COMPUTERS CAN COMMUNICATE OVER TELEGRAPH WIRES, AS WELL AS THE FOUR MAJOR RELIGIONS AND ORGANISATIONS THAT PLAYERS COULD ENCOUNTER. THE SECOND PART OF THE BOOK IS THE STEAMCRAFT GAME ITSELF. THIS STARTS WITH CHARACTER CREATION, EQUIPMENT AND PRICES, AN EXAMPLE OF CREATING A CHARACTER AND VARIOUS ARCHETYPES. GAME PLAY, NAMELY EXPERIENCE POINTS, FATE POINTS AND COMBAT, IS NEXT. THE BOOK THEN CONTINUES WITH VARIOUS RULES ON TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC, WITH SPELLS FOR DIFFERENT MAGICAL TYPES, AND HOW TO CREATE NEW ITEMS AND INVENTIONS, AND A SECTION ON SHIPS, PRIMARILY AIRSHIPS. THE SECOND PART FINISHES OFF WITH HOW TO RUN A GAME AND A BESTIARY OF VARIOUS RACES AND CREATURES. FINALLY, THERE IS THE APPENDIX, WHICH HAS SOME ADVANCED COMBAT RULES, WHICH ARE BOTH MORE REALISTIC AND DEADLIER, AS WELL AS WEAPONS DAMAGE CHARTS, THE CHARACTER SHEET AND THE SETTING MAP, WHICH COVERS THE UNCHARTED TERRITORIES. STEAMCRAFT IN REVIEW THE PDF LACKS BOOKMARKS; HOWEVER, THE INDEX IN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS IS CLICKABLE, WHICH MAKES UP FOR THIS, ALTHOUGH BOTH WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER. THE COVER ILLUSTRATION IS MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THE INTERNAL ONES; THE COVER LOOKS LIKE IT HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED, WHILST THE INTERIOR ILLUSTRATIONS GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING STOCK ART. THROUGHOUT THE BOOK ARE ALSO VARIOUS NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, WHICH GIVE BACKGROUND TO THE EVENTS AND SOCIETY OF THE SETTING, BY DESCRIBING EVENTS AND BY THE INCLUSION OF ADVERTS. THE STEAMCRAFT GAME SYSTEM IS A D100 BASED SYSTEM AND IS FAIRLY EASY TO UNDERSTAND; MOST TASKS REQUIRE ROLLING UNDER THE REQUIRED, POSSIBLY MODIFIED, NUMBER USING A D100. THE EXPERIENCE SYSTEM IS RATHER ODD, NOT SO MUCH IN HOW IT IS USED AS IN HOW EXPERIENCE POINTS ARE EARNED. EXPERIENCE POINTS ARE USED TO DEVELOP THE CHARACTER, BUT IT'S THE METHOD OF EARNING THE POINTS THAT IS A BIT STRANGE. THE BOOK SUGGESTS AWARDING 20 EXPERIENCE POINTS PER HOUR OF GAME PLAY, AND THIS REWARD IS NOT RELATED AT ALL TO WHAT A CHARACTER MIGHT HAVE DONE IN THAT HOUR - UNLESS THE GAMEMASTER DECIDES OTHERWISE, ACTIVITY PERFORMED HAS NO BEARING UPON THEM. IT SEEMS THAT, IN THIS CASE, EXPERIENCE POINTS ARE NOT REALLY NEEDED; WHAT YOU HAVE IS A SORT OF ODD CROSS BETWEEN A STORYTELLING SYSTEM AND A DICE-BASED ONE. THE MAGIC SYSTEM HAS SOME DIFFERENCES, BUT IT IS EASY ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND, AND QUITE A FEW OF THE SPELLS HAVE FAMILIAR-SOUNDING NAMES - FAMILIAR TO THOSE WHO HAVE USED MAGIC IN OTHER SYSTEMS. THERE ARE NO TRUE CHARACTER CLASSES; THERE ARE, HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF ARCHETYPES LISTED WHICH SHOW THE SKILLS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO DEVELOP A CHARACTER ALONG THE ARCHETYPE'S LINES, BUT THERE IS NO REASON WHY THESE SHOULD BE FOLLOWED; CHARACTERS CAN BE DEVELOPED ANY WAY THE PLAYERS WISH, INSIDE CERTAIN RULES. THE WORLD AS A WHOLE HAS VARIOUS COUNTRIES THAT CERTAINLY HAVE A FAMILIAR FEEL TO THEM; AS IT SAYS IN THE INTRODUCTION, THIS ISN'T EARTH, BUT THERE WILL BE FAMILIAR BITS. THIS INCLUDES GODS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM VARIOUS OLDER RELIGIONS AND SOME OF THE DESCRIBED COUNTRIES HAVE A FAMILIAR BASE. THE COMMONWEALTH OF NEW ARCADIA, AND SOME OF THE NEARBY AREAS AND COUNTRIES IN THE UNCHARTED TERRITORIES, ARE THE MOST DETAILED, AND HAVE A MAP - ALTHOUGH THE MAP COULD BE IMPROVED UPON, PERHAPS BY MAKING IT BIGGER AND AVAILABLE AS A SEPARATE FILE. THIS IS THE REGION WHERE ADVENTURES ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE. THE COMMONWEALTH HAS ELEMENTS OF VICTORIAN ENGLAND AND THE AMERICAN OLD WEST, AND SOME COLONIAL INFLUENCES, BY THE LOOKS OF IT INCLUDING AUSTRALIA. THIS COUNTRY ALSO HAS ELEMENTS OF A MODERN POLICE STATE. AS WELL AS THE COMMONWEALTH, THERE ARE ANCIENT EMPIRES, UNDEAD AND ELEMENTS OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC; THIS IS NOT JUST A PURE TECHNOLOGY SETTING. TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE SETTING, THERE ARE ALSO SOME SUPPLEMENTS AVAILABLE. STEAMCRAFT: SHADOWS OVER NEWPORT IS A COMBINATION OF CITYBOOK AND SETTING, WITH SOME NEW RULES AND ITEMS, AND THERE IS ALSO THE THREE PART ADVENTURE, STEAMCRAFT - WAKE THE DEAD. THE SETTING IS INTERESTING, BUT SOME OF THE ACTUAL GAME SYSTEM ELEMENTS SEEM A BIT LACKING, SUCH AS THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED EXPERIENCE POINTS, AND SOME OF THE TYPES OF MAGIC LOOK TO BE BETTER TO CHOOSE THAN OTHERS FOR PLAYERS. IT ISN'T MADE CLEAR AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ACTUALLY PLAYTESTED, BUT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO RUN AN ADVENTURE OR CAMPAIGN TO MAKE A DEFINITE DECISION ON THE SYSTEM ITSELF. HAVING SAID THAT, THIS IS A COMPLETE SYSTEM IN ONE BOOK, AND THERE ARE ITEMS, SKILLS, MAGIC AND CREATURES INCLUDED, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER IN PARTICULAR WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING EXPANDED WITH MORE CREATURES AND MORE SPELLS AND ITEMS WOULDN'T GO AMISS EITHER. BEING A PERCENTILE-BASED SYSTEM, IT MIGHT BE COMPARATIVELY EASY TO ADAPT THE SETTING TO ANOTHER GAME SYSTEM; DOING SO, HOWEVER, WOULD MAKE AROUND TWO-THIRDS OF THIS BOOK - THE PART TAKEN UP PRIMARILY BY THE GAME SYSTEM - RATHER UNNECESSARY.

980	ON FRIDAY 4TH, MS CECILIA NAHN, ARGENTINA AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES, WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR THE HUFFINGTON POST, TITLED 'MALVINAS: ALL ARGENTINA IS SAYING IS GIVE DIALOGUE A CHANCE.' IN THE ARTICLE, AMBASSADOR NAHN DESCRIBED HOW OLD POLITICAL DISPUTES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE BEING SOLVED AS A RESULT OF 'A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE AND DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS.' AMB. NAHN WENT ON TO DETAIL HOW THE QUESTION OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS WAS AN '182-YEAR OLD SOVEREIGNTY DISPUTE WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM', IN REFERENCE TO THE REASSERTION OF BRITISH SOVEREIGNTY OF THE ISLANDS IN 1833. ARGENTINA REFERS TO THIS AS THE 'USURPATION' OF THE ISLANDS, AND CLAIMS THAT THE ENTIRE ARGENTINA POPULATION WAS FORCIBLY EJECTED FROM THE ISLANDS, ALTHOUGH RECORDS WITHIN THE ARGENTINE NATIONAL ARCHIVES SHOW THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA STATES REGULARLY THAT ITS CLAIM TO THE FALKLAND ISLANDS RUNS CONTINUOUSLY FROM THE 1820S. IT DOES NOT. THE ARGENTINE CLAIM TO SPANISH SUCCESSION, WHICH WAS NEVER ACCEPTED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM, WAS ENDED BY THE 'CONVENTION OF PEACE', RATIFIED IN 1850, AND FOR 34 YEARS ARGENTINA WAS SILENT OVER THE FALKLANDS, DURING WHICH TIME SEVERAL ARGENTINE LEADERS STATED THAT ARGENTINA HAD NO DISPUTE WITH BRITAIN. THERE WAS A BRIEF FLURRY OF LETTERS IN THE 1880S BUT AFTER THAT, THE 'CLAIM' TO THE ISLANDS WAS DROPPED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA UNTIL THE 1930S. JOS MARA RUDA REIGNITED THE DISCUSSION OVER THE SO-CALLED 'CLAIM' TO THE ISLANDS IN 1965 WITH HIS IMPASSIONED (AND INACCURATE) SPEECH TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE III. THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT HAS PREVIOUSLY WORKED ALONGSIDE THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA, WITH JOINT ACCORDS ON A RANGE OF ECONOMIC ISSUES. ONE BY ONE, AND LARGELY UNDER A KIRCHNER REGIME, THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA HAS RENEGED ON THESE AGREEMENTS. IN THE DECADE OF KIRCHNERITE GOVERNMENT, ARGENTINA HAS WALKED AWAY FROM EVERY CHANCE OF DIALOGUE ON THE FALKLANDS. AMB. NAHN ACCUSES BRITAIN OF 'MILITARIZATION' OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC, BUT THE MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE ISLANDS IS A LEVEL APPROPRIATE TO DETER AGGRESSION BY ARGENTINA, AND IS PROPORTIONATE TO THE PERCEIVED THREAT. THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINE, WHILST DENYING ANY MILITARY DESIGNS ON THE ISLANDS, HAS SPENT THE PAST YEAR ATTEMPTING TO BROKER DEALS FOR FIGHTER AIRCRAFT FROM SPAIN, SWEDEN, ISRAEL, RUSSIA AND CHINA TO BOLSTER ITS OWN FORCES, YET BITTERLY COMPLAINS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES (INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW SCHOOL) IN THE FALKLANDS. THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF ALL PEOPLES IN ENSHRINED IN THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER, AND SAFEGUARDS THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO DETERMINE ONE'S OWN POLITICAL FUTURE, AND ANY ALLEGIANCES THEREIN. WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, HAVE A RIGHT TO A SAY IN OUR OWN POLITICAL FUTURE, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS ASSURED US THAT THERE CAN BE NO DISCUSSIONS ON SOVEREIGNTY WITH ARGENTINA UNLESS WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, SO WISH. AND WE EXPRESSED OUR WISH IN OUR HISTORIC REFERENDUM IN MARCH 2013. THIS WAS INTERNATIONALLY OVERSEEN AND SAW 99.8% OF THOSE WHO VOTED FREELY CHOOSING TO RETAIN OUR CURRENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UK. AMB. NAHN CLAIMED THAT THE UK REFUSES TO ENTER NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT ISSUES OTHER THAN SOVEREIGNTY. BUT IT IS UNTRUE. THE UK HAS SIMPLY SAID THAT ISLANDERS NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY DISCUSSIONS, AND WE HAVE EXTENDED NUMEROUS INVITATIONS TO TALK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA. THESE GO UNACKNOWLEDGED. IN FEBRUARY 2013 THEN- BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY HAGUE AGREED TO MEET WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF ARGENTINA IN LONDON. TIMERMAN REFUSED TO ATTEND BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE AND I, AS ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT, WERE PRESENT. THE EMPTY CHAIR AT THAT MEETING SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT THE SINCERITY OF ARGENTINA'S CALL FOR DIALOGUE. AMB. NAHN CLAIMS TO SEEK DIALOGUE WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM TO 'NEGOTIATE' OVER THE FALKLAND ISLANDS, YET THE ARGENTINE CONSTITUTION (REVISED IN 1994) PLAINLY STATES 'THE RECOVERY OF SAID TERRITORIES [FALKLAND ISLANDS, SOUTH GEORGIA & SOUTH SANDWICH ISLANDS] AND THE FULL EXERCISE OF SOVEREIGNTY [...] CONSTITUTES A PERMANENT AND UNRELINQUISHABLE GOAL OF THE ARGENTINE PEOPLE.' CONSTITUTIONALLY, THEN, ARGENTINA CANNOT, AND WILL NOT, SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN FULL CONTROL OF THE FALKLANDS, AND THEREFORE ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ISLANDS ISN'T A 'NEGOTIATION' AT ALL - WHEN ARGENTINA SAYS 'DIALOGUE' IT REALLY MEANS 'DELIVER THE FALKLANDS TO US.' THE FALKLAND ISLANDS GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH ARGENTINA ABOUT MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST, YET IT IS ARGENTINA WHO CONSISTENTLY IGNORES OUR INVITATIONS WHILST CRYING OUT FOR CONVERSATION. ARGENTINA'S DISINGENUOUS CALL FOR DIALOGUE IS IN REALITY A CALL TO COLONISE OUR COUNTRY, SEIZE OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND DENY OUR RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION. -- THIS FEED AND ITS CONTENTS ARE THE PROPERTY OF THE HUFFINGTON POST, AND USE IS SUBJECT TO OUR TERMS.

981	MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA AND BEAUTY ENTHUSIASTS CONVENED AT THE MAJESTIC HOTEL KUALA LUMPUR ON AUGUST 7TH FOR KOS SKINTECH 2015! THE SEMINAR WAS GRACED BY DR. NOBORU NAITO (EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT DIVISION IN KOS CORPORATION) AND DR. AKINOBU HAYASHI (GENERAL MANAGER, ADVANCED COSMETIC RESEARCH LABORATORIES, KOS CORPORATION). THEY PUT THEIR ALL INTO EXTENSIVE RESEARCH TO COME UP WITH HIGH PERFORMING PRODUCTS TO PRODUCE UNSURPASSED RESULTS. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF TRYING A COUPLE OF PRODUCTS FROM KOS CORPORATION'S VARIOUS LINES (INCLUDING JILL STUART, ESPRIQUE AND JUNKISUI) AND HAVE NEVER BEEN LET DOWN. (LEFT TO RIGHT): DR. NAITO AND DR. HAYASHI NOW, ON TO THE TWO NEW KEY PRODUCTS THAT WERE INTRODUCED DURING THIS VERY INFORMATIVE SESSION! DECORTE LIPOSOME TREATMENT LIQUID A LIPOSOME IS A TINY BUBBLE MADE OF PHOSPHOLIPIDS OR THE SAME MATERIAL AS A CELL MEMBRANE MEASURING 0.1 - 0.2 . AS CELLS MEASURE 60 - 80 , LIPOSOMES ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN SKIN CELLS. AND THANKS TO ITS CAPSULE FORMAT, IT CAN RELEASE ACTIVES TO TARGETED AREAS AT DESIGNATED TIMINGS. MOISTURE LIPOSOME ESSENCE, THE BRAND'S BESTSELLING PRODUCT WITH OVER THREE MILLION BOTTLES SOLD TO DATE, IS PRACTICALLY THE SYMBOL FOR LIPOSOME TECHNOLOGY. THIS YEAR, ITS TITLE MAY BE TAKEN OVER BY THE ALL-NEW DECORTE LIPOSOME TREATMENT LIQUID, THE INDUSTRY'S FIRST MULTI-LAYERED LIPOSOME LOTION! THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE CREATION OF DECORTE LIPOSOME TREATMENT LIQUID WAS REVEALED BY DR. NAITO DURING HIS SPEECH. A SUBSTANCE BETWEEN THE LAYERS OF THE STRATUM CORNEUM, KNOWN AS 'SKIN CAPACITORS', WAS DISCOVERED TO ALLOW SKIN TO RETAIN MOISTURE. SKIN WITH LARGER SKIN CAPACITORS ARE ABLE TO ABSORB AND RETAIN MORE NUTRIENTS, IMPROVING THE BARRIER FUNCTION AND IN TURN, MAINTAINING ITS HEALTHY, BEAUTIFUL CONDITION. THE LIPOSOME TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYED IN DECORTE LIPOSOME TREATMENT LIQUID ALLOWS THE LIPOSOME TO INCREASE SKIN CAPACITOR SIZE AND INJECT PLANT EXTRACTS AS WELL AS NUTRIENTS TO THE SKIN. AMONG ITS MANY FUNCTIONS AND BENEFITS INCLUDE IMPROVED SKIN CLARITY, INCREASED MOISTURE RETENTION ABILITY, REFINED SKIN TEXTURE AND MINIMISED PORES. DURING THE SESSION, WE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE AT HOW THE DECORTE LIPOSOME TREATMENT LIQUID WORKED. AND LET ME TELL YOU, THE ABILITY OF THE PRODUCT TO DISPERSE THROUGH A STIMULATED STRATUM CORNEUM MEMBRANE WAS NO JOKE. ON THE OTHER HAND, CONVENTIONAL EMULSIONS THAT UNDERWENT THE SAME TEST JUST SAT THERE AND DID NOTHING. SAFE TO SAY THAT YOU CAN HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS PRODUCT'S EFFICACY! INFINITY KOS REALIZING WHITE STICK XX DR. HAYASHI EXPLAINED THAT DARK SPOTS ARE CAUSED BY THE EFFECTS OF TYROSINASE, WHICH CONTAINS COPPER IONS. WHEN OUR SKIN IS EXPOSED TO UV RAYS, THE COPPER IONS SEND MESSAGES TO THE TYROSINASE TO START WORKING, RESULTING IN MELANIN PRODUCTION AND PIGMENTATION. KOJIC ACID STRIPS AWAY THE COPPER IONS SO THAT THEY FAIL TO ACTIVATE THE TYROSINASE, THUS PREVENTING MELANIN PRODUCTION. KOJIC ACID IS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING AND LIGHTENING THE FOUR MAIN TYPES OF PIGMENTATION: LIVER SPOTS, AGE SPOTS, FRECKLES AND INFLAMMATORY SCARS. THE LATEST WHITENING BEAUTY PRODUCT FROM KOS THAT INCORPORATES KOJIC ACID IS THE INFINITY KOS REALIZING WHITE STICK XX. IT INNOVATIVELY DELIVERS THE NATURALLY-DERIVED KOJIC ACID THROUGH A PRECISION SEALING FORMULA. WHEN THE STICK IS APPLIED ON THE SKIN, BEAUTY INGREDIENTS ARE SEALED OFF WITH A HIGHLY ADHESIVE OIL FOR INTENSIVE EFFECTS. IT WILL INHIBIT THE GENERATION OF MELANIN, PREVENT BLEMISHES AND FRECKLES AND CREATE HIGHLY TRANSLUCENT SKIN THAT IS BRIGHT AND SUPPLE. AND WHY KOJIC ACID INSTEAD OF OTHER KNOWN WHITENING AGENTS SUCH AS L-CYSTEIN, THIOUREA AND HYDROQUINONE? AN EXPERIMENT WAS DONE WHERE THE ADDITION OF KOJIC ACID TO WATER IN WHICH BLACK GOLDFISH WAS KEPT INDUCED A COLOUR CHANGE AFTER A MONTH. LATER ON, THE SAME GOLDFISH WAS KEPT IN WATER WITHOUT KOJIC ACID. IT TURNED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL COLOUR! THIS INDICATED THAT ONLY MELANOGENESIS WAS INHIBITED AND NOT SYSTEMATIC METABOLISM. IMPRESSED YET? WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS? ARE YOU LIKING THE SOUND OF THESE PRODUCTS? DECORTE LIPOSOME TREATMENT LIQUID WILL RETAIL FOR RM 378.40 (170 ML) WHEREAS INFINITY KOS REALIZING WHITE STICK XX WILL GO FOR RM 254.40 (4 G). THANK YOU, KOS MALAYSIA, FOR THE INVITATION, THE GENEROUS GIFT BAG AND THE FABULOUSLY FILLING LUNCH! I SIMPLY CANNOT WAIT TO SEE HOW THESE PRODUCTS WILL TRANSFORM MY SKIN! REVIEWS TO COME UP SOON!

982	THERES A BE NICE BE RESPECTFUL MOVEMENT UNDER FOOT AND I FOR ONE AM PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT. BEING A NICE PERSON MYSELF, ID ENJOY THE COMPANY. I WAS STARTING TO FEEL LIKE THE WORLD IN WHICH MY MOM TOOK GATORADE OUT TO THE CITY OF HUBBARD STREET DEPARTMENT WORKERS HAD DISAPPEARED FOREVER. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND ROAD CREWS NOW GET RUN OVER ON PURPOSE BY STRESSED-OUT HOUSEWIVES IN SUVS. IF THERES AN UPSIDE TO THE ROCK BOTTOM WE HIT WHEN A REPRESENTATIVE YELLED A THIRD-GRADE INSULT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS, ITS THAT NOW WE MAY HAVE BOUNCED OFF THE BOTTOM AND INSTEAD OF DROWNING IN OUR OWN ASSHATTERY, WE MADE IT BACK UP TO THE TOP, TOOK A BIG BREATH AND GASPED, YOU LOOK NICE TODAY. ID LIKE TO THINK MY MOM IS SMILING IN HER SIGNATURE WAY AND TELLING US WERE ALL EXCUSED FROM DETENTION BUT ARE ON PROBATION FOR LIFE. SO WATCH IT, MISSY. IM ALREADY PRETTY NICE, SO IM GOING TO DO MY PART IN THE BE NICE BE RESPECTFUL MOVEMENT WITH COMPLIMENTS. I THINK THAT WE ALL GET OFF ON FLATTERY. AND THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE IF WE PRAISED EACH OTHER MORE OFTEN. I THINK TELLING SOMEONE THEY GOT A GOOD HAIRCUT OR SMELL NICE OR HAVE ON A PRETTY OUTFIT OR MAKE A GREAT TASTING APPETIZER AT A POT LUCK IS THE KEY TO BEING NICE. IM NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIE LIKE A RUG EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR UNTIL THEY HAVE TO COMMENT ON YOUR NEW JACKET AND SUDDENLY THEYRE TRUTHY MCHONESTY AND COULD BE STRUCK DEAD IF THEY SAID CUTE JACKET! WHEN THEY IN FACT DO NOT THINK ITS CUTE AT ALL. WELL, IT IS COLORFUL! THEYLL BLURT OUT, SWEATING THE CLOSE CALL WITH ETERNAL DAMNATION. THE GUY AT THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TOLD ME ONCE I LOOKED LIKE HELEN HUNT AND I RODE HIGH ON THAT SILVER MOONBEAM OF BULLSHIT FOR LIKE A WEEK. I KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE, OK? I KNOW IN MY HEART AND IN MY SMART BRAIN THAT I DONT LOOK A THING LIKE HELEN HUNT. I HAVE LIGHT-ISH HAIR AND I HAVE ALL OF MY LIMBS. AND THATS ABOUT WHERE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN ME AND HELEN HUNT STOP. I KNEW HE WAS JUST PLAYING ME BECAUSE HES A SHMOOZING, BEYOND-HIS-YEARS GENTLEMANLY KIND OF CAR SERVICE DUDE. I DIDNT THINK ANY LESS OF HIM FOR MAKING UP SUCH A RIDICULOUS COMPLIMENT. I DIDNT SAY, ARE YOU BLIND? HAVE YOU EVER EVEN WATCHED MAD ABOUT YOU? I DIDNT CARE. I JUST WANTED TO BE COMPLIMENTED. IT FEELS GOOD. EVERY TIME. WHEN I WAS IN MY 20S, SOME GUY IN A LOUNGE BAR TOLD ME I SHOULD BE UP ON STAGE SINGING WITH THE BAND BECAUSE IM SUCH A GREAT SINGER. YES, A DRUNK GUY WHO WASNT EVEN SURE I HAD A TONGUE AND VOCAL CHORDS TOLD ME I WAS A GREAT SINGER AND INSTEAD OF SAYING, MAN, WHOS YOUR DESIGNATED DRIVER? I DID AN AW SHUCKS MOVE AND BRIEFLY CONSIDERED MEETING HIM FOR COFFEE THE NEXT DAY. AND THEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, MY FRIEND ANA SAID I REMINDED HER OF JENNIFER LAWRENCE. I HAD JUST FINISHED TELLING A LONG STORY WHERE I USED LOTS OF ARM MOTIONS AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. YOU REMIND ME OF SOMEONE. WHO IS IT? WHO AM I THINKING OF? ANA SAID. GROVER? SOMEONE SAID. MARY KAY PLACE, I CHIMED IN. I WHIPPED OUT MY PHONE AND BROUGHT UP THE PHOTO OF HER, POST-BIG CHILL. WE COULD BE SISTERS, OR COUSINS WHO GET OUR HAIR CUT AT THE SAME SALON. NO, ANA SAID. THE GIRL WHO WAS IN SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK AND A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF. JENNIFER LAWRENCE?? MY FRIEND KATHY SQUAWKED. SOMEONE SPIT A DRINK. I INSTANTLY FELT MYSELF GETTING A LITTLE BIT PUMPED UP. MY EGO SWELLED IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO EVERYONES INDIGNATION. I MEAN, HONESTLY, WHO DOESNT WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE OF JENNIFER LAWRENCE? SHES ABOUT 17 AND HAS VERY VERSATILE HAIR. WITHIN SECONDS IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT IT WAS MY VOICE THAT REMINDED ANA OF JENNIFER LAWRENCES VOICE, BECAUSE ITS DEEP AND I SOMETIMES OVER-ENUNCIATE WITH UNDERTONES OF VALLEY GIRL AND OVERTONES OF SARCASM AND BOREDOM. IVE ALWAYS BEEN FINE WITH MY DISTINCTIVE VOICE, EVEN WHEN IT SCREWED ME ON NATIONAL TELEVISION, WHERE I ATTEMPTED TO BE ENTHUSIASTIC AND SOUNDED LIKE A PMS PRINCESS ON MUSCLE RELAXERS. BUT I WAS FINER WITH IT NOW THAT I WAS BEING COMPARED TO ONE OF THE HOTTEST HOLLYWOOD STARS, SOMEONE WHO COULD ROCK A BURLAP SACK AS EASILY AS A DRESS MADE OF FIRE. I TOOK THAT COMPLIMENT AND PARADED IT AROUND FOR ABOUT A WEEK. IM HOPING MY RANDOM COMPLIMENTS WILL CATCH ON. ITS EASY AND IT DOESNT COST YOU ANYTHING TO SPREAD THAT KIND OF HAPPINESS AROUND. I EXPECT TO SEE MORE SMILES, MORE HAPPINESS, AND MORE PEOPLE QUITTING THEIR DAY JOBS TO AUDITION FORTHE NEW JOHNNY DEPP MOVIE.
983	IN 2011 SFFS DEBT WAS $112 MILLION BUT IT BALLOONED TO $387M. AN AGGRESSIVE REPAYMENT PLAN WAS EXPECTED THIS YEAR TO SHRINK IT TO ABOUT $150 MILLION. SFF CHAIRMAN ROB HEWETT SAID THE MARKET PANICKED TO SECURE LAMBS FOLLOWING THAT HORROR SNOWSTORM BUT BY JANUARY 2012 PRICES COLLAPSED AND MARKETS SLOWED, LEADING TO A MASSIVE BUILD-UP OF INVENTORY. THAT INVENTORY HAD TO BE FUNDED, LEAVING SFF, IN PARTICULAR, BADLY EXPOSED. COLLECTIVELY, THE MEAT INDUSTRY LOST $200M THAT YEAR, HE SAID. SFF WAS ALSO COMMITTED TO REBUILDING ITS FIRE-DAMAGED TE AROHA BEEF WORKS, DECIDING TO INVEST $30M MORE THAN THE INSURANCE PAYOUT TO MAKE IT A STATE-OF-THE-ART PLANT. IT ALSO TRIED TO LOCK IN SUPPLY BY OFFERING FARMERS WHAT PROVED TO BE GENEROUS, LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR SHEEP MEAT AND BULL BEEF. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS CONTRACTING SUPPLY COST SFF $50M. THOSE COMMITMENTS HAVE FINALLY BEEN WOUND DOWN. OTHER COMMENTATORS ALSO POINT TO THE PROTRACTED AND BITTER 2004 BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF RICHMOND WHICH COST $150M AND CREATED AN ABUNDANCE OF ANIMOSITY AMONG NORTH ISLAND FARMERS. WHILE DEBT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE, HEWETT SAID A REVIEW IDENTIFIED ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE AS A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY. SPECIFICALLY, BANKS WANTED A STRONGER DEBT-EQUITY RATIO BECAUSE OF THEIR RISK EXPOSURE. HEWETT SAID THE ASSOCIATED UNCERTAINTY EVERY YEAR AFFECTED STAFF MORALE, CONFIDENCE AND THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND PLANS. THE MOVE TO CONSUMER-READY PRODUCTS IN ITS PLATE TO PASTURE STRATEGY HAS ALSO BEEN COSTLY AND WHILE SALES CONTRIBUTE 5% OF REVENUE, IT HAS BEEN A LONG PROCESS REQUIRING ONGOING INVESTMENT OF UP TO $4M A YEAR. SFF HAS TWICE PREVIOUSLY SOUGHT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO REDUCE DEBT, FUND NEW TECHNOLOGY AND ITS PLATE TO PASTURE CONSUMER RETAIL PACK STRATEGY. IN 2008 SHAREHOLDERS AGREED TO SELL HALF THE COMPANY TO PGG WRIGHTSON IN A $220M DEAL BROKERED BY THE LATE CRAIG NORGATE AND TWO DUNEDIN BUSINESS BROTHERS BAIRD AND ALAN MCCONNON. ONE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT MOST BANKS DO NOT WANT TO LEND TERM DEBT TO MEAT COMPANIES. ROSS HYLAND MIE THE DEAL WOULD HAVE SEEN PGG WRIGHTSON TAKE A HALF SHARE IN THE COMPANY AND SOURCE STOCK FOR SFF, ALLOWING THE MEAT CO-OPERATIVE TO RETIRE DEBT, SAVING IT $20M A YEAR IN INTEREST COSTS, AND INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGY AND MARKETING. BUT THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS INTERVENED AND PGG WRIGHTSON COULDNT RAISE THE MONEY. A SETTLEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED IN WHICH PGG WRIGHTSON PAID SFF $25M AND ISSUED IT WITH 10M ORDINARY SHARES. IRONICALLY, THE MONEY WAS SOURCED FROM SOUTH CANTERBURY FINANCE, WHICH LATER COLLAPSED BECAUSE OF DEBT. A YEAR LATER SFF WENT TO SHAREHOLDERS WITH A NEW CAPITAL STRUCTURE OFFER, SEEKING $80M BUT HOPING FOR $128M. IT SECURED JUST $22M. THE FUNDS WOULD HAVE RETIRED $70M IN MATURING BONDS AND ALLOWED INVESTMENT OF BETWEEN $25M AND $30M FOR X-RAY CARCASE IMAGING AND ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGY. ON AT LEAST TWO OCCASIONS SERIOUS CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO A MERGER WITH ALLIANCE GROUP. SFF WALKED AWAY FROM MERGER TALKS WITH ALLIANCE IN 2007 WHEN THE INVERCARGILL CO-OPERATIVE VALUED SFF AT VIRTUALLY NOTHING. A YEAR LATER SFF WALKED AWAY AGAIN FROM A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD HAVE LOCKED UP ABOUT 80% OF THE NATIONS RED MEAT PROCESSING SAYING CONCESSIONS ALLOWING OTHER COMPANIES TO EXEMPT PRODUCT WOULD HAVE UNDERMINED ITS EFFECTIVENESS. THAT LACK OF PROFITABILITY AND PERCEIVED RISK PLAGUES THE MEAT INDUSTRY AND LIMITS ITS ABILITY TO SECURE LONG-TERM FUNDING, MEAT INDUSTRY EXCELLENCE ADVISER ROSS HYLAND SAYS. ONE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT MOST BANKS DO NOT WANT TO LEND TERM DEBT TO MEAT COMPANIES. AS A RESULT COMPANIES WERE LIMITED IN WHERE THEY COULD SOURCE FUNDING AND WERE FORCED TO PAY PREMIUM INTEREST RATES, HE SAID. BECAUSE OF ITS SCALE, LACK OF RISK BY HAVING CONTRACTED SUPPLY AND GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS, INVESTORS VIEWED FONTERRA DIFFERENTLY AND IT WASNT RELIANT ON TRADING BANKS BUT COULD GET FUNDING, SUCH AS BONDS, FROM INTERNATIONAL EQUITY MARKETS. HYLAND SAID UNPAID SEASONAL FINANCE WAS OFTEN ROLLED OVER INTO TERM DEBT WHICH WAS PAID DOWN IN A GOOD YEAR BUT LOW MARGINS MEANT IT BUILT UP AGAIN.
984	THOSE OPTIONS WERE REVISED AND NARROWED DOWN BY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND HALL COUNTY STAFF UNTIL THE FINAL LOGO DESIGN WAS COMPLETE. THE NEW LOGO DESIGN AND SLOGAN WERE A PART OF A LARGER REBRANDING EFFORT, WHICH INCLUDED A REDESIGN OF THE COUNTY WEBSITE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONAL VALUES AND THE RELEASE OF A HALL COUNTY PROMOTIONAL VIDEO. GAINESVILLE - HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT RECEIVED NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR ITS NEW LOGO DESIGN PROJECT DURING LAST WEEK'S 3CMA CONFERENCE IN ATLANTA. 3CMA, THE CITY-COUNTY COMMUNICATIONS AND MARKETING ASSOCIATION, IS A NETWORK OF PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC COMMUNICATORS AND MARKETERS FROM ALL OVER THE NATION. THE ORGANIZATION'S ANNUAL SAVVY AWARDS COMPETITION RECOGNIZES OUTSTANDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACHIEVEMENTS IN COMMUNICATIONS, PUBLIC-SECTOR MARKETING AND CITIZEN-GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS. HALL COUNTY COMPETED AGAINST HUNDREDS OF ENTRIES FROM GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY - AND WAS PRESENTED WITH THE SILVER CIRCLE AWARD FOR THELOGO DESIGN PROJECT, WHICH WAS COMPLETED LAST YEAR. "THE LOGNO DESIGN PROJECT WAS TRULY A GRASSROOTS EFFORT, LAUNCHED WITH THE INPUT OF CITIZENS AND EMPLOYEES," HALL COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR RANDY KNIGHTON SAID. "WE ARE HONORED TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE THOROUGH AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROCESS WE USED TO PRODUCE A QUALITY BRAND THAT TRULY EXEMPLIFIES HALL COUNTY'S UNIQUE ASSETS." THE LOGO FEATURES TWO FLOWING BLUE STRIPES, A SOFT GREEN ARC AND THE IMAGE OF A RISING YELLOW SUN, COMPLETE WITH "RAYS" IN THE SHAPE OF MECHANICAL COGS. EACH ELEMENT OF THE LOGO HIGHLIGHTS A DISTINCT CHARACTERISTIC OF HALL COUNTY. "THE BLUE STREAKS REPRESENT LAKE LANIER, AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF HALL COUNTY'S LANDSCAPE AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE," SAID KATIE CRUMLEY, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER FOR HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT. "THE BLUE LINES ALSO RESEMBLE ROADWAYS, GIVING A NOD TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE HALL COUNTY PROVIDES AND MAINTAINS FOR ITS CITIZENS." CRUMLEY SAID THE GREEN ARC IS REMINISCENT OF HALL COUNTY'S LOCATION AT THE FOOTHILLS OF THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS AND THE AREA'S RICH AGRICULTURAL HERITAGE. THE RISING SUN REPRESENTS THE COUNTY'S CURRENT STATE OF GROWTH AND POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. "THE MECHANICAL COGS SEEN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SUN ALSO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE FACT THAT HALL COUNTY IS MOVING FORWARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND THRIVE IN THE FUTURE," SHE SAID. THE JUDGES FOR THE 3CMA SAVVY COMPETITION PRAISED HALL COUNTY FOR CITIZEN AND EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT AND THEIR IMPRESSIVE BRAND IDENTITY STANDARD GUIDE. HALL COUNTY BEGAN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A NEW LOGO IN 4014 WITH A COUNTYWIDE SURVEY AVAILABLE ON THE COUNTY'S WEBSITE, HALLCOUNTY.ORG. THE SURVEY ASKED FOR FEEDBACK FROM HALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND HALL COUNTY RESIDENTS ABOUTY WHAT IMAGES, COLORS, FONTS AND MORE SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN THE NEW DESIGN. THE SURVEY ALSO ASKED WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN A FOCUS GROUP DEDICATED TO EXPOUNDING ON THE SURVEY RESPONSES. TWO FOCUS GROUPS, ONE INVOLVING CITIZENS AND ONE INVOLVING IHALL COUNTY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, WERE HELD TO GARNER MORE INPUT ON THE LOGO DESIGN AND SLOGAN. FOLLOWING THE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF CITIZEN AND EMPLOYEE INPUT, FORUM COMMUNICATIONS,A LOCAL FULL-SERVICE STRATEGIC MARKETING AGENCY , WAS HIRED AS A CONSULTANT FOR THE ACTUAL DESIGN OF THE LOGO. USING INPUT GENERATED FROM CITIZEN SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS, SEVERAL LOGO OPTIONS WERE DEVELOPED.
985	STOCK INDEX FUTURES STOCK INDEX FUTURES ADVANCED FOLLOWING A 1.9% GAIN IN THE SHANGHAI COMPOSITE INDEX. THE 9:00 CENTRAL TIME AUGUST EXISTING HOME SALES REPORT IS EXPECTED TO SHOW A DECLINE OF 1.6% TO 5.5 MILLION. LAST THURSDAYS DOVISH FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY STATEMENT SUPPORTS OUR VIEW THAT THE BULL MARKET FOR EQUITY FUTURES WILL CONTINUE AND NEW HIGHS FOR ALL OF THE MAJOR STOCK INDEX FUTURES WILL BE MADE NEXT YEAR. CURRENCY FUTURES THE U.S. DOLLAR ADVANCED AFTER THREE FED OFFICIALS, WILLIAMS, BULLARD AND LACKER OVER THE WEEK END ARGUED THAT HIGHER INTEREST RATES ARE STILL WARRANTED THIS YEAR. THE EURO CURRENCY IS LOWER DUE TO INCREASED EXPECTATIONS THAT THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK MAY SOON INCREASE ITS ECONOMIC STIMULUS, WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF LOWERING THE VALUE OF THE EURO. IN ADDITION, THE EURO WAS UNDERMINED BY NEWS THAT MOODYS DOWNGRADED ITS CREDIT RATING OF FRANCE BY ONE LEVEL. THE BRITISH POUND IS LOWER IN SPITE OF A REPORT THAT SHOWED U.K. ASKING PRICES FOR HOMES INCREASED TO AN ALL-TIME HIGH IN SEPTEMBER. THE JAPANESE YEN IS LOWER AS SPECULATION REMAINS THAT THE BANK OF JAPAN WILL EXPAND ITS QUANTITATIVE EASING PROGRAM, POSSIBLY NEXT MONTH, WHICH REMAINS A LONGER TERM NEGATIVE FOR THE YEN. INTEREST RATE MARKET FUTURES PRICES ARE LOWER AFTER SEVERAL FED OFFICIALS OVER THE WEEKEND ARGUED THAT HIGHER INTEREST RATES ARE STILL WARRANTED THIS YEAR. LOCKHART OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL SPEAK AT 12:00 ON THE ECONOMY IN ATLANTA. THE PROBABILITY OF A RATE HIKE FROM THE FED AT THE OCTOBER 27-28 MEETING IS 11%, WHICH COMPARES TO 14% ON FRIDAY AND THE PROBABILITY OF A RATE INCREASE AT THE DECEMBER 15-16 MEETING IS 39%, WHEN 41% WAS PREDICTED ON FRIDAY.

986	SEPTEMBER IS THE PERFECT TIME OF YEAR FOR A LONG, LANGUID DINNER UNDER THE STARS. THE DAYS ARE STILL WARM, BUT IN THE EVENING, AS THE SUN SINKS DOWN, THE BREEZE COOLS, A HINT OF THE COMING OF AUTUMN. PLEASE, JOIN US FOR A QUIET CANDLELIGHT DINNER WITH FRIENDS AT INNISFREE. AN ALFRESCO DINING ROOM WHEN DAN AND I LIVED IN ATCHISON, KAN., WE LOVED TO SIT OUT ON OUR PORCH AND ENJOY THE EVENING. SO WHEN WE BEGAN DESIGNING OUR LITTLE LAKE COTTAGE, WE KNEW OUTDOOR LIVING SPACES WOULD PLAY A KEY ROLE. THE SMALL FRONT YARD, SANDWICHED BETWEEN A STONE RETAINING WALL AND THE HOUSE, SEEMED A PERFECT SPOT FOR A FLAGSTONE PATIO. THE BIG CONCRETE TABLE THAT SAT IN THE COURTYARD AT MY OLD HOUSE FIT PERFECTLY ON THE NEW PATIO AND GAVE US A WONDERFUL SPOT FOR ENTERTAINING. IN SEPTEMBER, THE GARDEN IS STILL LUSH, THE ROSES, SALVIA, CATMINT AND IMPATIENS PROVIDING COLORFUL LEAFY WALLPAPER FOR OUR OUTDOOR DINING ROOM. AND THE HUGE TREES THAT TOWER OVER THE HOUSE PROVIDE A LEAFY CANOPY, SHADING US FROM THE AFTERNOON SUN. IN OUR LITTLE COMMUNITY, EVERYONE WALKS THEIR DOGS IN THE EVENING, STOPPING AS THEY GO TO CHAT WITH NEIGHBORS. DAN AND I LIKE TO SIT OUT ON THE FRONT PATIO, RELAXING AFTER THE LONG DAY AT WORK, AND WAVE HELLO. IT JUST TAKES A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE NEIGHBOR DOGS SEE LYRIC SPLAYED OUT ON THE PATIO AND DRAG THEIR OWNERS DOWN THE STAIRS FOR A VISIT. MAYBE IT'S MY SMALL-TOWN ROOTS, BUT I LOVE LIVING THIS WAY. A WARM WELCOME WE ENTERTAIN MUCH MORE CAUSALLY THESE DAYS, NOW THAT WE LIVE IN THE COTTAGE. OUR DINNER PARTIES ARE MORE SPONTANEOUS, THOSE "WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS SATURDAY? DO YOU WANT TO DROP BY FOR DINNER?" KINDS OF EVENTS. ON ONE LOVELY SEPTEMBER EVENING, THE FORECAST WAS FOR A FULL MOON AND COOLER THAN NORMAL. PERFECT FOR A DINNER UNDER THE STARS, SURROUNDED BY CANDLELIGHT. WHEN I ENTERTAIN, I LIKE TO HAVE THE STAGE SET SO WHEN GUESTS WALK IN, THEY CAN DRINK IN THE ENTIRE SCENE AND KNOW THEY ARE IN FOR A FUN EVENING. WITH AUTUMN JUST AROUND THE CORNER, I DECIDED ON AN EARLY FALL THEME FOR OUR TABLE. I USED AN ADORABLE HOUND AND FOX DISHWARE AS MY INSPIRATION, COVERING THE CONCRETE TABLE WITH WOOD THROW BLANKETS IN A SIMPLE PLAID. I ALSO RESTED WOOL BLANKETS OVER EACH OF THE CHAIRS SO WE COULD WRAP UP SNUG AGAINST THE CHILLY NIGHT AIR. I WANTED A CENTERPIECE THAT WAS STRIKING, YET NOT BIG ENOUGH TO HAMPER CROSS-TABLE DISCUSSION BECAUSE I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE A LIVELY GROUP THAT HAD A LOT TO SAY. SO I STOLE SOME GIGANTIC BOOKS FROM DAN'S BOOK COLLECTION - THE WORKS OF CHARLES DICKENS - TO USE AS RISERS TO HOLD THE FAUX ANTLER CANDLE ALOFT. TO MAKE SURE WE HAD ENOUGH LIGHT TO EAT BY, WE ADDED AN OLIVE OIL JAR HOLDING A PILLAR CANDLE AND PETITE OIL LANTERNS AT THE TOP OF EACH PLACE SETTING. WHEN I ENTERTAIN, MY GOAL IS TO HAVE EVERYTHING DONE WELL AHEAD OF TIME, SO DAN AND I CAN RELAX FOR A FEW MINUTES, ENJOYING A DRINK WHILE WAITING FOR OUR GUESTS TO ARRIVE. I'VE DONE PHOTO FINISHES WAY TOO MANY TIMES - PULLING CURLERS OUT OF MY HAIR AND SHOVING THEM IN THE DRAWER OF THE ENTRY TABLE AS I RUSH PAST TO ANSWER THE DOOR. IT'S TOO STRESSFUL, SO NOW I START EARLY. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AN EXCUSE TO USE SOME ADORABLE LANTERNS FOR AN OUTDOOR EVENT, SO I COULDN'T WAIT TO DOT THEM AROUND MY PATIO. THE STAIRS LEADING DOWN FROM THE STREET WERE JUST SCREAMING FOR A COOL LIGHTING DISPLAY, SO WE PLAYED WITH FIRE UNTIL WE FOUND A LOOK WE LOVED. IN ADDITION TO THE OIL LAMP, WE POKED IN A MASON JAR FILLED WITH A FEW RIVER ROCKS AND A VOTIVE CANDLE. SMALL URNS TOPPED WITH TEA LIGHTS FINISHED OFF THE TRIFECTA. WE THEN LINED UP WHITE VOTIVES ON SOME LONG, THIN, FLAT BOARDS AND PUSHED THEM WAY BACK ON THE STEP, OUT OF HARM'S WAY. THANKFULLY NO ONE WORE A LONG, FLOWING DRESS, OR IT COULD HAVE GONE BAD IN A HURRY! SIMPLE, SATISFYING FARE TRACY, MY FRIEND WHO OWNS THE FRENCH BEE BAKERY IN PARKVILLE, MO., AND LENEXA, KAN., AND HER FIANCE JOHN ARE RENOVATING A HOUSE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, SO THEY JOINED US. TRACY HAS LEARNED IF SHE WANTS SOMETHING DELICIOUS TO EAT AT MY HOME, SHE HAS TO BRING IT HERSELF, UNLESS DAN IS GRILLING. OUR FIRST COURSE WAS AMAZING - PUMPKIN CURRY SOUP GARNISHED WITH POMEGRANATE SEEDS, ROASTED PUMPKIN SEEDS AND SUNFLOWER SEEDS. A TOSSED FRESH GREEN SALAD FOLLOWED. LIGHT AND SIMPLE, BUT SO SATISFYING. YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY YOU SHOULD NEVER DISCUSS POLITICS IN POLITE COMPANY? WE THREW THAT OUT THE WINDOW AND DUG INTO EVERY TOPIC UNDER THE SUN, FROM THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO HEALTH CARE REFORM. I LOVE A LIVELY TABLE, FULL OF PASSIONATE DISCOURSE, FUELED BY GREAT WINE. AS WE RELAXED AFTER OUR SECOND COURSE, I SMELLED A CAMPFIRE, THE FAMILIAR SCENT OF BURNING COALS AND FOOD COOKING OVER AN OPEN FIRE. FIRE! A LIGHTNING BOLT WENT THROUGH ME AS I REMEMBERED THE FOOD I'D PUT IN THE OVEN TO WARM! WE RUSHED INTO THE KITCHEN, THREW OPEN THE OVEN ... AND SAW THE CARDBOARD BOX HOLDING OUR NEXT COURSE, UP IN FLAMES! I PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH HEAT I GOT FROM MY GUESTS, WHO LAUGHED UNTIL THEY CRIED OVER THE FACT THAT I CAN'T EVEN WARM UP FOOD WITHOUT THE RISK OF BURNING MY HOUSE DOWN. THEY DECIDED THAT NEXT TIME MY HOSTESS GIFT WOULD NOT BE BOTTLES OF WINE, BUT A FIRE EXTINGUISHER! MY KITCHEN STILL SMELLS LIKE GIRL SCOUT CAMP. THE PERFECT END TO A PERFECT EVENING WITH THE GREAT GARRITY FIRE BEHIND US, WE SETTLED IN FOR A SWEET END TO A FUN EVENING: CREAM-FILLED PEAR TARTS, RESTING ON RASPBERRY COULIS, GARNISHED WITH A DARK CHOCOLATE G MONOGRAM, MADE BY TRACY AT THE FRENCH BEE. IN THE CRAZINESS OF THE EVENING, WE LEFT ONE OF THE TARTS UNATTENDED FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND LYRIC HELPED HERSELF, PARTIAL TO THE RASPBERRY COULIS. WE TOASTED EACH OTHER, AND THE FACT THAT WE HAD SOLVED ALL THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS OVER DINNER, WITH A GLASS OF COGNAC. IT WAS A PERFECT EVENING, FIRE FIASCO AND ALL. I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US AT INNISFREE, MY COTTAGE BY THE LAKE. THIS COLUMN WAS ADAPTED FROM MARY CAROL GARRITY'S BLOG AT WWW.NELLHILLS.COM. SHE CAN BE REACHED AT MARYCAROL@NELLHILLS.COM .

988	MANY EMPLOYEES SHARE THEIR PASSWORDS ON SCRAPS OF PAPER AND POST-IT NOTES MANY WORKERS HAVE ADMITTED TO BEING LAX WITH EMPLOYERS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IN A NEW REPORT BY DASHLANE, WITH YOUNGER WORKERS LIKELY TO CAUSE REAL HEADACHES FOR OWNERS OF SMALL BUSINESSES. THE PASSWORD MANAGEMENT PLATFORMDASHLANE, CONDUCTED A STUDY LOOKING INTO THE USE OF PASSWORDS IN THE WORKPLACE AND FOUND TOO MANY EMPLOYEES WERE SUFFERING FROM A STATE OF DIGITAL INDIFFERENCE. DASHLANES CEO, EMMANUEL SCHALIT, SAID EMPLOYEES HAVE TO BE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE FROM EXTERNAL THREATS, WHETHER THERE ARE IT DEPARTMENTS IN PLACE OR NOT, THROUGH EFFECTIVE PASSWORD SECURITY. DESPITE THE FACT HACKERS HAVE BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED AND CYBER CRIME HAS BEEN GETTING MORE ATTENTION, SCHALIT FEELS TOO MANY EMPLOYEES ARE TOO CASUAL WHEN IT COMES TO IT SECURITY. FROM THE STUDY, IT EMERGED MANY WERE LAX IN THEIR HANDLING OF EMPLOYERS SENSITIVE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. OF THE 1,000 PEOPLE SURVEYED IN THE UK, 44 PER CENT SAID THEY COULD ACCESS A FORMER EMPLOYERS SYSTEMS THROUGH OLD, UNCHANGED PASSWORDS. NEARLY THREE QUARTERS (70 PER CENT) ADMITTED THEY DIDNT HAVE OR DIDNT KNOW THEIR EMPLOYERS POLICY ON SHARING PASSWORDS. DESPITE BEING DIGITAL NATIVES, YOUNG PEOPLE WERE MOST LIKELY TO PUT THEIR EMPLOYERS COMPANY AT RISK WHEN IT CAME TO SECURITY, WITH 68 PER CENT OF THOSE AGED 16-24 SAYING THEY HAD SHARED A PASSWORD WITH A COLLEAGUE. DASHLANE SAID YOUNGER RESPONDENTS WERE THE MOST CASUAL IN THEIR APPROACH TO PASSWORD SECURITY AND PASSWORD MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. ANOTHER REPEATED MISSTEP CAME TO LACK OF FREQUENT UPDATING OF PASSWORDS 44 PER CENT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY COULD ACCESS AN ACCOUNT BELONGING TO A PREVIOUS EMPLOYER. WHILE THIS COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS ACCESSING A NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTION WITH AN OLD LOG-IN, DASHLANE POINTED OUT THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THIS COULD BE HUGELY RISKY. NEARLY 30 PER CENT OF THOSE SURVEYED SAID THEIR EMPLOYER NEVER CHANGED PASSWORDS, OR ONLY DID SO WHEN THERE WAS AN ISSUE. PASSWORD SHARING, WHILE MORE RIFE AMONG YOUNGER EMPLOYEES, WAS A UNIVERSAL PROBLEM, AS OVER HALF OF RESPONDENTS ADMITTED THEY HAD SHARED A PASSWORD WITH A COLLEAGUE AT SOME POINT. DASHLANE SAID PRACTICALLY, INDIVIDUAL SPECIFIC LOG-INS WERENT ALWAYS POSSIBLE, BUT REPORTS OF USING POST-IT NOTES AND UNSECURED SHARED SPREADSHEETS ARE ALL TOO COMMON. OVER A QUARTER OF WORKERS AGED BETWEEN 16-34 SAID THEY HAD WRITTEN DOWN PASSWORDS ON SCRAPS OF PAPER, WHILE OTHERS HAD SHARED THEIRS ACROSS EMAIL AND TEXT MESSAGES. EMPLOYERS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE MORE FORMAL GUIDANCE ON EXISTING RULES REGARDING PASSWORD POLICY, RESULTING IN A SITUATION WHERE THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE BECOMES CONVENTIONAL PRACTICE. GUILLAUME DESNOS, HEAD OF EUROPEAN MARKETS AT DASHLANE, SAID: OUR REPORT REVEALS A LACKADAISICAL APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL DATA, WHICH IS BEING DRIVEN BY THE INFLUX OF MILLENNIALS ENTERING THE WORKPLACE. THIS COULD SOON CAUSE REAL HEADACHES FOR THE OWNERS OF SMALL BUSINESSES. HE ADDED THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO EDUCATE BOTH BUSINESS LEADERS AND EMPLOYEES ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DATA THEYRE ENTRUSTED WITH, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EFFECTIVE PASSWORD POLICIES TO PROTECT IT. PASSWORD SHARING CAN MAKE A COMPANY SO MUCH MORE EFFICIENT, BUT IT NEEDS TO BE HANDLED PROPERLY, HE SAID. SIGN UP TO OUR NEWSLETTER TO GET THE LATEST FROM BUSINESS ADVICE.

992	WHEN LONDONS ICONIC RESTAURANT, THE IVY , RELAUNCHED IN JUNE FOLLOWING AN EXTENSIVE REFURBISHMENT, ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING CHANGES TO THE INTERIOR WAS THE ADDITION OF A CENTRAL CORAL ONYX DINING BAR. SITTING PROUDLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, THE NEW BAR ALLOWS DINERS TO TAKE CENTRE STAGE IN THE RESTAURANT; A PLACE TO PERCH FOR A PRE-DINNER DRINK, OR TO ENJOY A LAZYLUNCH OR DINNER IN PRIME POSITION. BAR MANAGER DARREN BALL, ALONG WITH XAVIER LANDAIS, GROUP BAR MANAGER, HAS CREATED A NEW COCKTAIL LIST FOR THE RESTAURANT WHICH HERALDS BACK TO THE GOLDEN ERA OF COCKTAIL BARS WITH DRINKS SUCH AS THE BEES KNEES, WHILE ALSO EMBRACING KITSCH CLASSICS LIKE THE PINA COLADA. THE LIST DOCUMENTS THE HISTORY OF THE IVY, BUT DARRENS MODERN VARIATIONS WILL ENSURE THAT ONE-TIME CLASSICS WILL BECOME ORIGINALS. SOME FAVOURITES ARE EMERGING LIKE THE STRAWBERRY DAIQUIRI, SERVED WITH A BOULE OF STRAWBERRY SORBET AND A SMALL CARAFE OF DAIQUIRI ON THE SIDE, THE LAPROUSE MADE WITH CHERRY BLOSSOM-INFUSED LILLET ROS, CHAMPAGNE AND ST GERMAIN ELDERFLOWER LIQUEUR, SMOKE ON THE WATER WITH ILEGAL MEZCAL, KAMM & SONS GINSENG SPIRIT, AGAVE, LIME, ARDBEG SPRAY AND DARRENS TAKE ON THE ESPRESSO MARTINI MADE WITH PREMIUM ABSOLUT ELYX VODKA, ILLY ESPRESSO LIQUEUR, FRESH ESPRESSO AND VANILLA SYRUP. DARRENS ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS EXEMPLIFIED IN HIS GARNISHES, FROM BALSAMIC PEARLS SPRINKLED ATOP THE DAIQUIRI FOR ADDED TASTE AND TEXTURE, TO THE TRIO OF MINIATURE SUGAR SHAKERS CINNAMON, CHOCOLATE AND VANILLA SERVED WITH THE ESPRESSO MARTINI. NOT ONE TO REST ON HIS LAURELS, DARREN HAS REINVENTED ANOTHER CLASSIC COCKTAIL FOR CHRISTMAS THE CHRISTMAS CAROL OLD FASHIONED. MIRRORING DICKENS EXPLORATION OF CHRISTMAS TRADITIONS FROM THE PAST TO PRESENT, DARREN WILL EXPLORE CHIVAS REGAL WHISKY THROUGH THE AGES, WITH THE NEW COCKTAIL INCLUDING THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS PAST (A 1970S VINTAGE BOTTLE OF CHIVAS REGAL 12 YEAR OLD), THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT (A CURRENT CHIVAS REGAL 12 YEAR OLD) AND THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS FUTURE (A STRATHISLA SINGLE MALT, WHICH WILL BE THE BASE FOR A FUTURE CHIVAS REGAL BLEND). SCOTTISH HEATHER HONEY, BITTERS AND A FLAMED ORANGE TWIST WILL BE ADDED TO THE THREEWHISKIES TO CREATE THE CHRISTMAS CAROL OLD FASHIONED. SERVED IN A FLOWER OF SCOTLAND CRYSTAL OLD FASHIONED GLASS, THE COCKTAIL WILL BE POURED OVER A PIECE OF PURE CARVED ICE AND WILL BE EXCLUSIVE TO THE IVY FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER FOR 15. FOR WHISKY LOVERS AND NOVICES ALIKE, THE NEW WHISKY BOX IS QUITE SOMETHING TO BEHOLD. CONTAINING 14SAMPLE SIZED BOTTLES OF THE IVYS RANGE OF WHISKIES, THE BLACK WALNUT AND GREEN LEATHER BOX EMBOSSED WITH THE RESTAURANTS LOGO, SHOWS JUST HOW SERIOUSLY THEY TAKE THEIR DRINKS. RANGING FROM AN INTERESTING SELECTION OF WELL-KNOWN DISTILLERIES TO RARE AND LIMITED EDITION WHISKIES, THE BOX CAN BE CARRIED TO DINERS TABLES TO ALLOW THEM TO PICK OUT AN OLD FAVOURITE OR SAMPLE SOMETHING NEW. WHILE COCKTAILS AND SPIRITS ARE EVIDENTLY A FOCUS HERE, IT IS STILL, PREDOMINANTLY, A DINING BAR. GUESTS MAY PERCH ALONG THE FRONT FEW SEATS WITH A DRINK BEFORE THEY EAT, BUT IN THE FEW MONTHS SINCE THE OPENING IT HAS BECOME APPARENT THAT THE 20 SEATS CIRCLING THE BAR ARE SOME OF THE BEST IN THE HOUSE. IN NEW YORK, BAR DINING HAS BEEN THE CHOICE OF THE FASHIONABLE, AND WITH THIS ADDITION TO LONDONS RESTAURANT SCENE, IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE TREND IS SET TO TAKE HOLD HERE TOO.
993	SO. DAD'S WORD TRUMPS THE WORD OF TWO WOMEN. WHAT ELSE IS NEW IN THE AMERICAN COURTS.... WIFE #1 "ABDUCTED" THEIR SON BECAUSE OF ABUSE CONCERNS INVOLVING HIS FATHER. CPS EVEN RAISED CONCERNS. THERE ARE UNSPECIFIED COURT REPORTS. ALL HAND WAIVED AWAY BY AN INDIFFERENT COURT. WIFE #2 SOUGHT A PROTECTION ORDER. YOU DON'T GET THOSE UNLESS THERE HAS BEEN PHYSICAL VIOLENCE OR A CREDIBLE THREAT THEREOF. YOU DON'T GET THEM BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR SPOUSE ARE HAVING "TRYING TIMES"-THAT'S JUST DAD'S ATTEMPT TO TOTALLY MINIMIZE AND AVOID RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS. WIFE #2 DIDN'T RENEW. BAD SIGN. RESEARCH IS SHOWING THAT WHEN WOMEN DON'T RENEW IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE THREAT HAS GONE AWAY. IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WITHOUT FURTHER JEOPARDIZING THEIR OWN SAFETY. AND NOW THIS ABUSER HAS CHILD CUSTODY. DAD IS IDENTIFIED AS BRANDON RUFFIN. HTTP://WWW.HILLSDALE.NET/ARTICLE/20150915/NEWS/150919449 KIDNAPPER MOM ARRESTED, FATHER RETAINS CUSTODY BY JASON DAFNIS POSTED SEP. 15, 2015 AT 9:12 AM HILLSDALE, MICH. HILLSDALE AFTER A COURT HEARING ON MONDAY AFTERNOON, THE FATHER OF A BOY KIDNAPPED BY HIS MOTHER NOW RETAINS CUSTODY OF HIS SON. NICOLE RUFFIN DISAPPEARED WITH HER SON, LAREDO, AFTER JUDGE MIKE SMITH GRANTED INTERIM CUSTODY TO BRANDON RUFFIN, LAREDOS BIOLOGICAL FATHER AND NICOLES EX-HUSBAND, ON AUG. 31. THE COURT PROCEEDINGS WERE PUNCTUATED BY REPORTS FROM CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES QUESTIONING THE CHILDS SAFETY. AFTER HER DISAPPEARANCE, A FELONY WARRANT ISSUED FOR NICOLES ARREST ON A CHARGE OF PARENTAL KIDNAPPING. MICHIGAN STATE POLICE TRACKED AND EXHAUSTED SEVERAL LEADS SINCE SEPT. 1, LOCATING AND ARRESTING HER AT A SPRING ARBOR CONVENIENCE STORE ON MONDAY. LAREDO WAS REMANDED INTO POLICE CUSTODY AT THE SAME TIME. THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS, KARLYE HORTON, NICOLES ATTORNEY, SAID AT THE CIVIL HEARING ON MONDAY. NICOLE, HAVING BEEN LODGED AT THE HILLSDALE COUNTY JAIL ONLY HOURS BEFORE, WAS NOT PRESENT FOR THE PROCEEDINGS. HORTON QUESTIONED BRANDONS SUITABILITY AS LAREDOS CUSTODIAN, CITING SEVERAL COURT REPORTS ABOUT THE CHILDS SAFETY AROUND BRANDON. ONE OF THOSE REPORTS INCLUDED A PERSONAL PROTECTION ORDER HIS CURRENT WIFE, HANNAH, FILED AGAINST BRANDON EARLIER THIS YEAR. THAT RECORD CLAIMS THAT BRANDON LAID HANDS ON HANNAH, THOUGH BRANDON DENIES THOSE CLAIMS, SAYING THAT HE AND HIS WIFE HAD TRYING TIMES PRIOR TO THE PPOS EXPIRATION IN JULY. HANNAH AND BRANDON REMAIN TOGETHER TODAY. HORTON ALSO BROUGHT BEFORE SMITH THE CLAIM THAT BRANDON HADNT SEEN LAREDO MORE THAN A FEW TIMES SINCE BRANDON AND NICOLE WERE DIVORCED IN 2012. AGAIN, BRANDON REFUTED THE LEGITIMACY OF THAT ARGUMENT, SAYING THAT HE WAS NEVER SERVED THE PROPER DIVORCE PAPERS OR CUSTODY NOTIFICATIONS. I SAW MY SON ON A REGULAR BASIS, BRANDON SAID. HE CLAIMS THAT AFTER THE DIVORCE, HIS ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT NICOLE FOR SCHEDULING WERE CHRONICALLY IGNORED. HANNAH AND OTHER MEMBERS OF BRANDONS FAMILY AND FRIENDS WERE PRESENT IN THE COURTROOM, AS WERE MEMBERS OF NICOLES FAMILY, BOTH SUPPORTING THEIR RESPECTIVE SIDES. BRANDON HAS BEEN DISHONEST ABOUT HIS POSITION IN THE COURT, HORTON SAID. SMITH CONTINUED BRANDONS INTERIM CUSTODY, AN ORDER WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT MONDAY AND RUNS THROUGH AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING SCHEDULED FOR OCT. 23. A MORE SOLID CUSTODY RULING IS EXPECTED TO BE IMPOSED ON THAT DATE. HORTON DECLINED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF HER CLIENT FOLLOWING THE HEARING. I AM A LOVING DAD, BRANDON SAID AFTER THE CONFERENCE. IM GONNA KEEP FIGHTING FOR CUSTODY OF MY SON UNTIL THE GOOD LORD SAYS I CANT ANYMORE. ITS A HAPPY DAY."
994	HTTPS://TWITTER.COM/KUN304/STATUS/646833692770332672/PHOTO/1 TRANSLATED AND EDITED BY BRETT LARNER 2014 HAKONE EKIDEN FIRST STAGE WINNER HIDETO YAMANAKA, A FOURTH-YEAR AT 2013 HAKONE EKIDEN CHAMPION NITTAI UNIVERSITY, HAS QUIT THE SCHOOL'S EKIDEN TEAM. LEFT WITHOUT ITS STAR RUNNER, NITTAI WILL SHOOT FOR ITS 68TH-STRAIGHT HAKONE EKIDEN APPEARANCE WHEN IT RUNS THE OCT. 17 HAKONE EKIDEN YOSENKAI QUALIFYING RACE. YAMANAKA RAN THE THIRD STAGE AT THE 2013 HAKONE EKIDEN AS A FIRST-YEAR, PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN NITTAI'S FIRST OVERALL HAKONE WIN IN 30 YEARS. AS A SECOND-YEAR HE WON THE 21.4 KM FIRST STAGE IN 1:01:25, WITH A 1:02:09 COURSE RECORD WIN TWO MONTHS LATER AT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HALF MARATHON CHAMPIONSHIPS CEMENTING HIS POSITION AS A TOP-CLASS COLLEGIATE ATHLETE. SHORTLY AFTERWARD, HOWEVER, HE SUFFERED A LONG-LASTING STRING OF INJURIES THAT KEPT HIM OUT OF COMPETITION THROUGHOUT HIS THIRD YEAR UNTIL A SURPRISE RETURN AT THE START OF HIS FOURTH YEAR TO WIN THE 10000 M AT MAY'S KANTO REGION UNIVERSITY TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS UNDER NEW HEAD COACH MASAAKI WATANABE. A TEAM SPOKESPERSON COMMENTED, "YAMANAKA HAS LEFT UNIVERSITY ATHLETICS EARLY IN ORDER TO ENSURE A FULL RECOVERY FROM HIS INJURIES. THIS DECISION COMES FROM NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS AND IS IN NO WAY A RESULT OF ANY CONFLICT WITHIN THE TEAM." AFTER GRADUATING NEXT SPRING YAMANAKA PLANS TO ENTER THE CORPORATE LEAGUES TO CONTINUE HIS ATHLETIC CAREER. TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: YAMANAKA CAME TO NITTAI IN 2012 UNDER LONGTIME HEAD COACH KENJI BEPPU. AT THE START OF THE 2015-16 ACADEMIC YEAR IN APRIL BEPPU WAS REPLACED BY WATANABE, WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY LEFT HIS POSITION AT TOYOKAWA KOGYO H.S. AFTER A MAJOR SCANDAL IN 2013 INVOLVING HIS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ABUSE OF MALE AND FEMALE TOYOKAWA KOGYO EKIDEN TEAM MEMBERS, GOING ON TO SPEND A YEAR COACHING AT THE NITTAI-RELATED EBARA H.S. BEFORE MOVING UP TO THE UNIVERSITY THIS YEAR. IT IS RELATIVELY COMMON FOR COACHING CHANGES TO RESULT IN TEAM MEMBERS LEAVING, AND WITH ONLINE TALK SUGGESTING FOUR OTHER NITTAI MEMBERS HAVE ALSO QUIT THE SPOKESPERSON'S CLAIM OF NO CONFLICT WITHIN THE TEAM MUST BE VIEWED WITH SKEPTICISM.
995	WATERLOO THE MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS FORMER FIVE POINTS CORRECTIONAL FACILITY INMATE WILL GO ON TRIAL IN NOVEMBER.  IN FACT, REWRITE IT LARGER. SENECA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY BARRY PORSCH SAID JURY SELECTION IN THE TRIAL OF BRIAN KARRIS WILL OCCUR NOV. 13.  36. PORSCH IS PROSECUTING THE CASE. HE SAID HE EXPECTS THE TRIAL TO LAST ABOUT FIVE DAYS. KARRIS, 38, IS CHARGED WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER IN THE DEC. 14, 2013, DEATH OF THOMAS BLANCKE AT THE MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON IN ROMULUS.  URINE PH IS MONITORED ROUTINELY AND RATION PARTICLE LENGTH AND MOISTURE CONTENT ARE WATCHED CLOSELY.  HER WEEKEND WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A DOMINATING FIRST PLACE PERFORMANCE IN THE 5K RUN AND A 4TH PLACE FINISH IN THE CROSSFITTY CROSSFIT WOD.  BATESVILLE HAS PLAYED IN FOUR BLOWOUTS, WINNING ALL OF ITS GAMES BY AT LEAST 22. CORRECTIONS OFFICERS FOUND BLANCKE, 24, DEAD AT ABOUT 6 A.M. IN THE CELL HE SHARED WITH KARRIS. ATTORNEY ROME CANZANO OF AUBURN, A FORMER PROSECUTOR WITH THE CAYUGA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE, IS REPRESENTING KARRIS. SENECA COUNTY JUDGE DENNIS BENDER IS PRESIDING OVER THE CASE. DURING A SUPPRESSION HEARING EARLIER THIS YEAR, A SENIOR CORRECTIONS OFFICER SAID HE WENT TO THE CELL AFTER ANOTHER OFFICER TOLD HIM SOMETHING WAS WRONG. ANTHONY EDICK SAID BLANCKE WASNT BREATHING WHEN HE ARRIVED. THE JURY WILL SEE A 35-MINUTE INTERVIEW BETWEEN KARRIS AND CIVILIAN OFFICIALS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES; THE LATTER QUESTIONED KARRIS AFTER THE INCIDENT. ON THE VIDEOTAPE, KARRIS SAID HE AND BLANCKE FOUGHT BECAUSE BLANCKE TOOK HIS MATTRESS, SAYING WHEN HE WENT TO HIS CELL FOR THE NIGHT, BLANCKE HAD PLACED IT UNDER HIS OWN BEDDING.  THE AMERICAS CUP IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST DIFFICULT TROPHY IN SPORT TO WIN. IN AN INTERVIEW THAT WAS RAMBLING AT TIMES, KARRIS SAID THE ARGUMENT BECAME HEATED ABOUT 3:30 A.M. AND TURNED PHYSICAL WHEN BLANCKE REFUSED TO RELINQUISH THE MATTRESS. KARRIS CLAIMED BLANCKE STARTED THE FIGHT. AT ONE POINT, KARRIS SAID BLANCKE HAD HIM IN A CHOKEHOLD. HE SAID HE EVENTUALLY PUNCHED BLANCKE IN THE FACE AND LATER STOMPED HIS HEAD. HE WAS CHOKING ME TO DEATH, KARRIS SAID DURING THE INTERVIEW. I SAID, ITS DO OR DIE ... SO I SUBDUED HIM. I DID NOT WANT TO KILL HIM. IT DIDNT HAVE TO COME TO THIS. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT BLANCKE WAS INJURED BADLY, KARRIS SAID HE DIDNT KNOW HE WAS DEAD UNTIL LATER THAT DAY. KARRIS WAS MOVED OUT OF FIVE POINTS FOLLOWING BLANCKES DEATH AND IS NOW INCARCERATED AT ELMIRA CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.  "ESPECIALLY THE FUN ANIMAL SHOWS BECAUSE HE WOULD DO ALL THE VOICES AND IT WAS WAY MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THE ACTUAL SHOW," SHE SAYS. CANZANO SAID HE INTENDED TO CHALLENGE THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE VIDEO FOR TRIAL. HOWEVER, HE ADDED THAT KARRIS SAW IT AND HE CONSENTED FOR IT TO BE SHOWN TO THE JURY.

THE RIFT DATES BACK TO A PAYMENT SCHEME THE GOVERNMENT UNILATERALLY IMPOSED LAST JANUARY AFTER A YEAR OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OMA ENDED IN AN IMPASSE. IT INCLUDED A 2.65 PER CENT FEE CUT AND A CLAWBACK PROVISION WOULD TAKE EFFECT IF DOCTORS' OHIP BILLINGS WERE TAKING DOCTORS THEIR $11.6-ALLOTMENT. THE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENT MODEL ALLOWS DOCTORS TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPENSATION. IF THEY SEE MORE PATIENTS AND PERFORM MORE PROCEDURES, THEY CAN BILL THE PUBLIC INSURANCE PLAN FOR MORE MONEY. THE PAYMENT SCHEME ALSO INCLUDES INCREASES OF 1.25 PER CENT IN THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES BUDGET FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

HEALTH MINISTER ERIC HOSKINS SAID HE WANTS TO REASSURE ONTARIANS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SERVICE CUTS.

DOCTORS ARE AMONG THE BEST PAID IN CANADA WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF ABOUT $350,000, AN AMOUNT THAT HAS GROWN BY 60 PER CENT OVER THAT LAST DECADE, HOSKINS SAID.
